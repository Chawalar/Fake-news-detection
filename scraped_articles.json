So were nearly half of those who qualified for temporary cash assistance from the government.\n\nEmployers who pay low wages and don\u2019t offer benefits have in effect been subsidized through programs providing publicly funded medical insurance, rent money and food stamps to their workers.\n\nNow individual employees with few resources \u2014 rather than companies or partners \u2014 are compelled to absorb some of the routine risks and uncertainties of running a business. Scheduling software that constantly changes a worker\u2019s daily shifts to match an unexpected slowdown or rush improves a business\u2019s bottom line but can ruin a household\u2019s by causing wages to fluctuate widely from one week to the next. Such shifting not only scrambles family life, but also makes it more difficult to schedule other paid work.\n\nAt large companies, employees have seen their spending on health care \u2014 because of lower deductibles and higher premiums and co-payments \u2014 increase twice as fast as their wages over the past decade, according to the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker.\n\nAt the same time, the cost of other necessities like housing has shot up. Millions of renters spend more than half their incomes on housing. Middle-income households, too, have been hit by escalating housing costs. Since 2000, a steadily growing share of this group has spent more than a third of earnings on rent.\n\nFor years, households have strained to navigate this cut-to-the bone economy with varying success.

Most of our online political communication takes place on internet platforms that are designed to amplify content that provokes strong emotional reactions, often by reinforcing tribal identities. Mr. Trump\u2019s unfiltered, combative style is a natural fit for the hyperpolarized audiences on Facebook and Twitter, whereas Mr. Biden\u2019s more conciliatory, healer-in-chief approach can render him invisible on platforms where conflict equals clicks.\n\nThose structural disadvantages hobbled Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 social media campaign, which struggled for traction despite big budgets and her name recognition. The Trump campaign also paid lower effective rates for Facebook ads than the Clinton campaign because Facebook\u2019s automated ad-buying system gives more reach to ads that generate lots of engagement.\n\nRob Flaherty, the digital director for the Biden campaign, said in an interview that he considered the 2020 election a \u201cbattle for the soul of the internet,\u201d which required not just taking shots at Mr. Trump but inspiring people to come together around Mr. Biden.\n\n\u201cIf you want to succeed on the internet without turning into Donald Trump, the best thing you can do is show empathy and compassion, and build community,\u201d Mr. Flaherty said. \u201cOur digital strategy is going to reflect that.\u201d\n\nYouTube, where progressives have only recently started competing for attention with an extensive network of popular right-wing creators, is particularly thorny territory for a centrist pragmatist like Mr. Biden. The platform\u2019s left-wing commentariat, often referred to as \u201cLeftTube\u201d or \u201cBreadTube,\u201d mostly seems to consist of young Sanders supporters who see Mr. Biden as an establishment phony.

The election of President Trump and the onset of a trade war with China had already made multinational companies start to rethink their operations.\n\n\u201cI think companies are actively talking about resilience,\u201d said Susan Lund, a partner at McKinsey who studies global interconnectedness. \u201cTo what extent would companies be willing to sacrifice quarter-to-quarter efficiency for resilience over the long term, whether that\u2019s natural disasters, the climate crisis, pandemics or other shocks?\u201d\n\nShe envisions not so much a full-scale retreat from global trade as a shift toward regional trade blocs and greater emphasis on having companies build redundancy into their supply networks. Governments will probably insist that certain goods, like pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, rely more on domestic production given the current global scramble for those items.\n\nChina has reoriented its economic strategy, aiming to be not a low-cost manufacturing hub for the world but the maker of technologically advanced products like aircraft and telecommunications equipment. That has made Americans, Europeans and the Japanese all the more reluctant to have major operations in China, for fear of intellectual property theft.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the United States has experienced strain with even traditional allies in Western Europe.

Natural wine bars are common in almost every big city, while even some high-end restaurants have devoted entire lists to natural wines.\n\nThis new popularity has forced the sort of reckoning that natural wine producers have for so long successfully avoided \u2014 namely, what exactly is natural wine and who is permitted to use the term?\n\nIn the past, it was the wine mainstream demanding a definition for natural wine, an entreaty that most producers blithely ignored. Definitions smacked of authority, orthodoxy and bureaucracy, exactly the binding forces that many natural wine producers have long viewed as inhibiting their freedom.\n\nI always saw this refusal to be pinned down as a strength. Allowing natural wine to be strictly defined would set it up to be co-opted, the way many organic food companies are now largely profit-making subdivisions of Big Ag.", "author": ["Eric Asimov"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/coronavirus-rural-hospitals.html", "published": "2020-04-16T20:19:35", "title": "A Tiny Hospital Struggles to Treat a Burst of Coronavirus Patients", "text": "Dr. Desmond Wah is used to being the only physician tending to patients during his shifts at Margaret Mary Community Hospital in Batesville, Ind., population 6,500, where at least half of the 25 beds are usually empty.

Your note is a testament to the fact that such actions foment paranoia and curiosity. Better just to leave the white noise machine on all the time. (While reporting a story from Cinnabon headquarters, I learned it\u2019s common for open-plan offices to have faint noise pumped in all day long, to prevent conversations from carrying across cavernous work spaces.)\n\nI advise you to make nothing out of this.

What the Fed is doing is to try and keep the wheels turning.\u201d\n\nSo far, it has been working. After the Fed\u2019s intervention in the credit markets, bonds rallied in late March to put most bond funds that focus on investment-grade issues into positive territory for the quarter.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s intervention was especially calming for bond E. T. F.s, where the share price can trade above or below the value of the underlying bonds, which is called the net asset value. Typically, E.T.F. fund prices closely track the N.A.V. During the sell-off, bond E.T.F. prices traded at big discounts, which was of concern for short-term traders, though not something long-term investors need to worry about.\n\nMs. Jones suggests following the Fed\u2019s lead as the coronavirus crisis continues to unfold. \u201cBuying what the Fed is buying is not the worst investment strategy.\u201d Initially, in March, that only included investment grade bonds.

If a BBB-rated bond issuer struggles to stay current with payments during this economic crisis, its rating could be lowered, effectively sending it off the edge of the investment-grade cliff into \u201cjunk\u201d bond status.

I appreciate everybody being here and everybody\u2019s support massively.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo now, Dr. Rosenberg is taking over for the doctors who were working the night before, and he\u2019s beginning to make his rounds.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Let\u2019s start with number two, and then just go around the unit please. All right, so lucky number two.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo nearly all the patients in the I.C.U. are on ventilators.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg So do we have any history of smoking, shisha use, anything like that?\n\nsheri fink\n\nSome have asthma. Some have diabetes.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. What did he do for a living? Occupational exposure?\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut a lot of these patients don\u2019t have any underlying conditions at all.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg I\u2019ll just write \u2014 because I mean, listen, on some of these you have a real reason why. You know, they may have bad lungs, and that makes it worse. Sometimes it\u2019s just the disease, but if there\u2019s something we can do to \u2014\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo Josh and the other doctors are kind of confounded by some of the patients. They don\u2019t understand why, if they don\u2019t have a lot of underlying health issues, why their lungs look so bad.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Crap. Reported any asthma?\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd they also just don\u2019t have that much to offer.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg OK. So what are we going to do with him? doctor Right now, we are \u2014 well, at this point, I\u2019m not too sure what we can do with him. We have \u2014 we tried to [VOICE FADES]. dr. josh rosenberg So what is he on drug-wise?\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo, I mean, for most patients, they\u2019re trying this thing called the Covid cocktail, which is that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. That\u2019s that combination the President talks about a lot.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg I don\u2019t think it\u2019s doing much.\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut there\u2019s really very little evidence, and Dr. Rosenberg in particular is very unsure that those drugs really help.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg We\u2019ll see about remdesivir, and we\u2019ll see if we get some Covid results and see what we can do.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo they start talking about other possibilities. There\u2019s this experimental drug called remdesivir that you have to apply to the manufacturer for each patient, and they have to meet certain criteria. You have to have a test result. They can\u2019t have certain complications.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg How do you guys feel about Kaletra or our other PIs? doctor They don\u2019t work at all.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere\u2019s another drug called Kaletra that doctors think might have some effect.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg The data\u2019s very \u2014 I mean, I think the data is very weak all over the place. That\u2019s the basic problem. So I always look at it as, where are you starting these drugs? It\u2019s near the end of a sporting event. You\u2019re down by a lot, and I don\u2019t care you throw out there, right? Even freaking Jordan couldn\u2019t recover that basketball game outside of Space Jam when you\u2019re down by 100 points and starting the fourth quarter. doctor That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think we should be giving it to patients who are already near the end.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo they kind of toss this around.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Yeah. And so we don\u2019t know. I mean, that\u2019s the point. We really just don\u2019t know our data, but like, so looking at this \u2014 yeah. So we\u2019ll figure out. We\u2019ll see if we get the remdesivir, which I doubt we\u2019ll be able to. We\u2019ll try to get a positive test result. Next. Let\u2019s move on along. OK. I.C.U. six. Going for c-section? doctor Supposedly today, yeah.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere was another Covid patient in the Intensive Care Unit on a ventilator, and she was pregnant, which adds a whole layer of complexity.\n\ndoctor She needs another dose of decadron, and then \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg Decadron? No. Beclomethasone. doctor Oh, sorry. Beclomethasone. Did I say decadron? dr. josh rosenberg Yes.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd they actually decided to deliver the baby by c-section two months before the due date. They had to give a couple of doses of steroid medication to help mature the baby\u2019s lungs. The whole goal was to save the mother\u2019s life, because I think part of it is that it gives more space for the lungs to expand once the baby is taken out.\n\ndoctor So if she\u2019s going for a c-section then she won\u2019t need remdesivir, right? dr. josh rosenberg I have no clue.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo far what\u2019s known is it tends to be quite rare that a baby would be born with Covid if the mom has it. At least that\u2019s what the early studies say.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. Number four. Number four. How are we doing here?\n\nsheri fink\n\nIt might be surprising how enthusiastic Dr. Rosenberg sounds while discussing these patients, but he\u2019s leading this team. He\u2019s trying to keep morale up.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. So I\u2019m going to stop here and head downstairs. Again, he\u2019s going to take six, seven, nine. Thank you. I will circle in with you guys. Good job. doctor Thank you. OK. dr. josh rosenberg Good job. doctor Oh, me?\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut actually, when we were going from one part of the I.C.U. to another \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Let\u2019s go downstairs. [SIGHS] I don\u2019t like taking the elevators.\n\nsheri fink\n\nHe runs into one of his medical students.\n\nsheri fink Hi, guys. dr. josh rosenberg How are you doing, buddy? doctor As best as I can. dr. josh rosenberg One, shouldn\u2019t you be home? doctor Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg Shouldn\u2019t you be home? doctor My mom\u2019s here. dr. josh rosenberg Oh, fuck. doctor I know. dr. josh rosenberg Which bed is she in on that side? doctor She\u2019s in 10. dr. josh rosenberg OK. I\u2019m rounding her now. doctor OK. May I speak to you at some point today when you have a chance? dr. josh rosenberg Call me at any point. All right? doctor Thanks, Doctor. Appreciate it. dr. josh rosenberg I\u2019ll see you later. Call me if you need anything, in all seriousness. You have my cell, right? doctor Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg Perfect. He\u2019s one of our medical students. He\u2019s been here forever. So we sent home all the medical students that rotate with us very early in this crisis, because I kind of looked at this and I said, one, we don\u2019t have enough PPE, you know, for all of the medical students that are coming through. And two \u2014 you know, I hate to say it like this \u2014 like, I don\u2019t want to expose them. They have enough time to get the living daylights scared out of them. sheri fink Right. dr. josh rosenberg [LAUGHS] Let them actually be students for a bit.\n\n[music]\n\n[AMBIENT VOICES]\n\ndoctor 1 I\u2019m going to give myself the option, because it\u2019s my clinic. doctor 2 OK, because tonight we\u2019re going to publish the new schedule, OK? dr. josh rosenberg Next patient. Santos. doctor Yeah. So this is our \u2014 she\u2019s our 54-year-old female, history of hypertension, came here with shortness of breath, fever, is admitted for acute hypoxic \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg She\u2019s the mom of our med student, right? doctor Yes. She\u2019s confirmed positive Covid.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd when we get to this medical student\u2019s mom, things are not looking good.\n\ndoctor Her FI, too, has been hovering between 100 to 80. I just want to make sure you know that she\u2019s not doing OK. dr. josh rosenberg She\u2019s not doing well. Um, yeah, I\u2019ll speak to the son. I know him pretty well. doctor Yeah he\u2019s in here always. dr. josh rosenberg Is he the next of kin? Is he the next of kin? He\u2019s the decision maker? doctor Right now he has family \u2014\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd Dr. Rosenberg wants to find out, is the son \u2014 is the medical student \u2014 the one who will be making decisions about her further treatment, about even possibly end of life care.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg But is he giving us consents? doctor Yes. dr. josh rosenberg Or does she have a husband? doctor Yeah, yeah. He\u2019s been giving consent. dr. josh rosenberg This is going to be hard, because he knows. He\u2019s a smart kid.\n\nsheri fink\n\nI mean, to me it sounded like he feels that this medical student, even though he\u2019s still a student, is enough of a doctor to understand that the prognosis isn\u2019t great \u2014 that perhaps his mom has some risk factors for this being more severe, and for her to possibly not make it.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg He\u2019s a good dude. He\u2019s a very sweet man, so we\u2019ll figure it out.\n\nsheri fink\n\nOf course, when it\u2019s your family member, it\u2019s not so simple.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. Here.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere are many cases where the doctors and the patient\u2019s families have very different views of how to proceed with treatment.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Covid? doctor Acute respiratory \u2014 yeah. Well, it\u2019s pending, but most likely. dr. josh rosenberg OK. So his pulmonary prognosis is horrible, right? doctor Yes. dr. josh rosenberg He\u2019s not getting better. doctor No, he\u2019s not. dr. josh rosenberg Blood gas is \u2014 doctor Not good enough. dr. josh rosenberg Not good, and he\u2019s on 100%. doctor Yes. dr. josh rosenberg So what does the fam want us to do? doctor The family wanted us to continue treatment. They agreed to the NI.\n\nsheri fink\n\nWhere the family still wants to press forward with all the intensive care available.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Right. So how many organ systems do we have down on him? We have our kidneys are down, our respiratory system\u2019s down, his cardiovascular is bad. He\u2019s on multi-organ system failure, right? So I have three out of my systems down already. His prognosis at that point, given his disease status, is just poor, unfortunately.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd where the doctors had come to a different conclusion and really felt like there wasn\u2019t much hope, and that in fact the goals of care should shift away from trying to extend life and much more toward comfort and end of life \u2014 accepting that the patient was likely going to die.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg And I hate to say it like this, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m able really to offer in terms of getting him back to where he was before. [SIGHS] Next.\n\n[music]\n\ndoctor\n\nCheck vitals from there too \u2014\n\nspeaker (on intercom) Attention, please. Attention, please. Code blue, 6B.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSuddenly, we hear this announcement go out over the hospital loudspeaker saying, code blue \u2014\n\nspeaker (on intercom) Code blue, 6B. [KNOCKING] doctor Josh?\n\nsheri fink\n\n\u2014 which means that somebody needs to be resuscitated, that they are basically dying.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg OK. It\u2019s code blue. you\u2019re on outreach or RESA? doctor RESA. sheri fink OK. All right. Can we follow you? doctor Yeah.\n\n[music]\n\n[AMBIENT CHATTER]\n\ndoctor 1 Covid or non-Covid? doctor 2 No, it\u2019s not Covid. doctor 3 OK.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo the code blue, it turned out, wasn\u2019t for a Covid patient, but for a patient who had other medical problems.\n\ndoctor 192. That\u2019s the code for 6A.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd they did CPR, and the patient survived.\n\ndoctor I got it. You\u2019re good.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd for me, the moment was really just highlighting the fact that, in a hospital, that that work goes on \u2014 that there are all these other patients, too, who have different medical problems, and people are still having other emergencies. So hospitals can\u2019t just stop being hospitals for everybody else. I But it\u2019s hard, because the number of patients with Covid is increasing. Usually, if you have people with a scary, infectious disease you would put them in specific rooms in the hospital, but, of course now there\u2019s many more patients than there are isolation rooms. So I think the doctors are very concerned about this possibility that somebody could come into the hospital for something else \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg She\u2019s Covid negative? doctor \u2014 and then, you know, catch Covid there. That\u2019s the real worst case scenario. dr. josh rosenberg She\u2019s not a Covid issue? doctor Not really, no. dr. josh rosenberg Let\u2019s try to get her the heck out of this unit, please. OK? Get her out.\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut of course, one of the big risks is to be a person who is walking into that hospital every day to work there.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Hello. Dr. Rosenberg speaking. I was paged.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd in fact, at one point \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Yes, yes, yes.\n\nsheri fink\n\nDr. Rosenberg gets word that one of his residents \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg He has Covid.\n\nsheri fink\n\n\u2014 tested positive for Covid and is in the emergency room downstairs.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Thanks. All right. What\u2019s up? You have his X-ray up? OK. I\u2019ll look at it in two seconds.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSomeone pulls up an X-ray of the resident\u2019s lungs for him to look at, and he peels off his Personal Protective Equipment, which in this case includes his own ski goggles, and he looks at the X-ray. And immediately, the tone shifts.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg That\u2019s shitty. I don\u2019t like that. I want him here. He is one to come up. doctor Yeah. Is that a \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg He comes right up, because he\u2019s high risk for getting intubated. doctor Yeah.\n\nsheri fink\n\nWhat he sees on the X-ray is something that looks bad to him.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg That\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about, because his X-ray looks crappy. doctor You know that he works here, right? Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg No. doctor It was just, like, let\u2019s just go back \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg He\u2019s one of our surgical residents. Bring him to the I.C.U.. Bring him here. Don\u2019t dilly. Don\u2019t \u2014 doctor No, no, I\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m just saying \u2014\n\nsheri fink\n\nI think what was really striking to him, or what sort of, like, shocked him was that this was another doctor.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg That is ours. That is one of us.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd close to his age, and somebody who\u2019s been doing the same kind of work that he\u2019s doing every day. And I think that shatters that sense of invulnerability.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg This is insanity. For my first day after being back from a week in this crap, holy shit.\n\nsheri fink\n\nI actually found out partway through that day that Dr. Rosenberg, himself, had been out the previous week with symptoms of Covid. He actually didn\u2019t get a test until his symptoms had resolved, and it turned out to be negative, but he\u2019s pretty sure he had Covid.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Well, one of the things we\u2019ll discuss that the nurse was telling you, but we need more nurses.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd this is a huge problem. A third of the doctors and nurses were out sick. A number of them had tested positive for Covid and were critically ill. And it\u2019s not just a problem for this hospital. It\u2019s a problem all over New York City, that as the hospitals are overwhelmed with Covid patients, you have high numbers of health staff out sick.\n\nandrew cuomo Good afternoon. Thank you all for taking the time for being here today. As Governor of New York, I am asking health care professionals across the country, if you don\u2019t have a health care crisis in your community, please come help us in New York now.\n\n[music]\n\nsheri fink\n\nThe day that I was at the hospital, New York Governor Cuomo pleaded for doctors and nurses and health care staff from around the U.S. to come to New York \u2014\n\nandrew cuomo We need relief. We need relief for doctors. We need relief for attendants.\n\nsheri fink\n\n\u2014 in part to help fill in for the workers who are falling ill across the state.\n\nandrew cuomo So if you\u2019re not busy, come help us please. dr. josh rosenberg Hey. Hey, he\u2019s going to be in I.C.U. 12, OK? No, not yet. They\u2019re about to bring him up shortly, but we\u2019re getting everything done. I know. I know. Trust me, it\u2019s freaky. I mean, he\u2019s only five years younger than me, you know? I\u2019m 45, like half of our patients upstairs. We have 40-year-olds who are intubated. Jesus. Geez. [GROANS] Man, this is brutal. All right, good. I just wanted to let you know where it would be, all right? You got it. I\u2019ll speak to you later. Bye. [SIGHS] I am tired. [AMBIENT CHATTER]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nA few days ago, as the daily death toll in New York began to decline, state officials said it appeared that the pandemic was approaching its peak, and that the worst was over. But on Monday, New York\u2019s daily death toll spiked again to 778. So far, nearly 11,000 people in the state have died from the coronavirus. Among them was the mother of Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s medical student, who died the day after Sheri visited the hospital.

The Constitution \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Tuesday, governors on the East and West Coast, led by Andrew Cuomo of New York, rejected President Trump\u2019s claim that he has the legal authority to reopen the American economy by himself once he determines that the pandemic is over.\n\nandrew cuomo The federal government does not have absolute power. It says the exact opposite that the president said. It says, that would be a king. We would have had King George Washington. We didn\u2019t have King George Washington, and we don\u2019t have King Trump. We have President Trump.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAppearing on NBC and MSNBC, Cuomo said that if Trump prematurely instructed states to end their lockdowns, many governors would disregard the order.\n\nandrew cuomo If he says to me, I declare it open, and that is a public health risk or it\u2019s reckless with the welfare of the people of my state, I will oppose it.

But the Fed made clear that the new debt purchasing program was to be used primarily for bridging over a few months of low revenue, with repayment due when normalcy returns.

All borrowings must be repaid within two years.\n\nSome policy analysts said the time frame was too short, given the bleak outlook.\n\nThomas H. Cochran, a senior fellow at the Northeast Midwest Institute, said it would be better if the Fed made loans that could eventually be forgiven, as long as the states could show they had used the money to keep public services at pre-pandemic levels after their revenue dried up.

Economists at Morgan Stanley put the number at around $2.5 trillion in 2020 alone, rising to as much as $3 trillion for the entirety of the bond-buying program.\n\nBut the Fed isn\u2019t an ordinary bondholder: By law, it has to pay its profits to the Treasury.\n\nThat means when the Treasury makes payments on bonds held by the Fed \u2014 either paying interest or paying it off at maturity \u2014 almost all the money eventually moves back to the Treasury.\n\nWhen a government bond is involved, the cash moves from one government pocket to another.\n\n\u201cOnce the central bank buys them, it\u2019s as if the Treasury never issued them in the first place,\u201d said Dr. Kelton, who was an adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cFor all intents and purposes, they\u2019re retired.\u201d\n\nThe CARES Act borrowing is, in many ways, the natural result of an evolution that began with the 2008 financial crisis. The bond-buying programs that central banks undertook around the world helped ensure low-cost financing for governments running giant deficits as policymakers contended with a deep recession and a prolonged period of lackluster growth.

Older populations, those that are more concerned with the impact personally, are stating that they have higher levels of travel anxiety. It\u2019s consistent with what the virus is doing and what people are hearing. I think that\u2019s the important part. The messaging is really key to getting everybody in different demographic populations to respond in the same way so that we can level out the curve.\n\nRespondents in the Northeast are the most concerned about travel now, which tracks with the outbreak. What else does regional data indicate?\n\nRegardless of whatever crises I\u2019ve worked with, people always ask the same kind of question: When do you know when the crisis is over? We\u2019ll have some markers along the way that start to signal the crisis is over, but it\u2019s really important that destinations realize their particular destination may be at a different stage of the crisis wave than other destinations. So, it\u2019s important for them to monitor at a global level as well as at a more micro level. The data will help them determine what they need to be doing at what stage to be able to prepare to bring people back.\n\nWhat are the implications for the travel industry ahead?\n\nAs far as the travel and tourism industry, one of the things that we\u2019ve seen from crises in general is that the industry is very resilient, and that we rebound fairly quickly. We also are seeing that there will be some pent-up demand and that people will be ready to travel. There\u2019s some indication that travel will be closer to home initially and that people will do more driving tourism. But there\u2019s going to be a segment of the population that is more willing to jump on a plane and go overseas.\n\nIn a March survey, those making over $125,000 were more interested in traveling than those with lower incomes. Did that surprise you?\n\nNo. For the most part, we know that travel experience is related to perceptions of risk, and that the more people travel, the more they are exposed to different levels of risk and that they feel more equipped to be able to deal with it. So, their self-efficacy goes up and therefore their perception of risk goes down and their willingness to travel goes up. Income is related to experience, so they\u2019re more likely to have traveled more frequently and to a greater variety of places, whether for work or leisure.\n\nThose under 25 report less anxiety than older people. Why?\n\nThe youth market tends to be more accepting of risk. They\u2019re more adventure travelers. They participate in riskier activities, not just in travel but in their lifestyle in general. Overall, everybody\u2019s perception of risk is increasing, but relative to other age groups, theirs is less.", "author": ["Elaine Glusac"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html", "published": "2020-04-16T05:37:55", "title": "Bleak Data Shows Extent of Economic Damage", "text": "The retreat Wednesday came the day after the S&P 500 hit a one-month high.

One condition is that the laws of nature might not be as symmetrical as physicists like Einstein assumed.\n\nIn a purely symmetrical universe, physics should work the same if all the particles changed their electrical charges from positive to negative or vice versa \u2014 and, likewise, if the coordinates of everything were swapped from left to right, as if in a mirror. Violating these conditions \u2014 called charge and parity invariance, C and P for short \u2014 would cause matter and antimatter to act differently.\n\nIn 1957, Tsung-Dao Lee of Columbia University and Chen Ning Yang, then at Institute for Advanced Study, won the Nobel Prize in Physics for proposing something along these lines. They suggested that certain \u201cweak interactions\u201d might violate the parity rule, and experiments by Chien-Shiung Wu of Columbia (she was not awarded the prize) confirmed the theory. Nature, in some sense, is left-handed.\n\nIn 1964, a group led by James Cronin and Val Fitch, working at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, discovered that some particles called kaons violated both the charge and parity conditions, revealing a telltale difference between matter and antimatter. These scientists also won a Nobel.\n\nHints of a discrepancy between matter and antimatter have since been found in the behavior of other particles called B mesons, in experiments at CERN and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIn the larger picture, CP violation is a big deal,\u201d Dr. Turner said. \u201cIt is why we are here!\u201d\n\nBoth kaons and B mesons are made of quarks, the same kinds of particles that make up protons and neutrons, the building blocks of ordinary matter.

So if they want to move, \u201cthey can only use their fins,\u201d Mr. Boute said. It also gives them their strange shapes: other boxfish species look like purses, Frisbees or ottomans.\n\nIn 2015, a group of researchers, including Mr. Boute\u2019s two co-authors, published a study suggesting that these carapaces make the bodies of some boxfish species inherently unstable in the water.

Hi.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo every morning in the Intensive Care Unit at the Brooklyn Hospital Center, the doctors gather for something called morning report.\n\ndoctor 1 So now, I want you all to present in a straight, true way \u2014\n\nsheri fink\n\nThe people who were on overnight, they stand around and the head doctor is there, and they kind of give a report of what happened. And then, the new doctors who are coming on, they get that information.\n\ndoctor 2 Yeah. When she was at rest this morning, she was breathing 23. She\u2019s very comfortable, thumbs up.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThey talk about, you know, who was admitted, who got critically ill.\n\ndoctor 3 The overnight patient is not doing well.

Next.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n\n[music]\n\nToday: It\u2019s been more than a month since the coronavirus descended on New York City\u2019s hospitals and on Brooklyn Medical Center, where the vast majority of patients in critical care have the virus. My colleague, Sheri Fink, followed one doctor through a single day there. It\u2019s Wednesday, April 15.\n\ndoctor Morning, everybody. [AMBIENT CHATTER] doctor 1 Josh, do you want to spend the \u2014 do you mind? This is Sheri. doctor 2 Sure. doctor 1 She\u2019s with The New York Times, and she\u2019s gonna spend some time here a little bit. doctor 2 Pleasure. doctor 1 It\u2019s up to you. doctor 2 I\u2019m fine with \u2014 sheri fink I\u2019m a physician. doctor 1 A physician and a writer.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo for the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been embedded in the Brooklyn Hospital Center.\n\ndoctor 1 I\u2019m going to finish rounding here, and then I\u2019m going to go downstairs and cover SI. doctor 2 OK.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd what I\u2019ve been able to see there is incredibly unique \u2014 what\u2019s happening? What is it like inside a hospital during a pandemic?\n\ndr. josh rosenberg \u2014 then we\u2019ll figure out the rest. doctor OK. All right. sheri fink Do you want to give him your mic, or are you willing to wear a mic?\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd there was one doctor I met who really embodied that transparency.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Does it beep every time I say a four-letter word like South Park?\n\nsheri fink\n\nDr. Josh Rosenberg.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg I am mildly inappropriate. I\u2019m just warning you.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAn attending physician in the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nsheri fink How are you, Peter? doctor Hi, how are you \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg I didn\u2019t see you hiding over there, my friend.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere are people from all over the hospital recruited to work in the I.C.U., so it\u2019s not just, like, I.C.U. doctors and nurses who are used to intensive care treatment, but in fact \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg And she\u2019s one of the podiatry residents, so all people who are good with knives and big needles.\n\nsheri fink\n\nWhen I was there that day, there was a podiatry doctor and two of her residents. Those are doctors who work on the feet.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg No, no, no. What I would like to do is that, as much as possible, we\u2019re going to try to get all of the Covids on one side, and then the whole area is a dirty area.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd the I.C.U. had actually effectively doubled in size, so it was completely full. And they had to turn to other areas of the hospital to turn them into Intensive Care Units. In fact, a big part of the I.C.U. is now in a place that just a few weeks ago was where patients would come for outpatient chemotherapy treatments. That\u2019s now in I.C.U..\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Frankie, watch out. Don\u2019t trip Don\u2019t trip Don\u2019t trip. Don\u2019t trip. Don\u2019t trip.\n\nsheri fink\n\nIt was also a bit of an obstacle course.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Don\u2019t trip.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere were cords everywhere.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Please be careful, Do you have gloves?\n\nsheri fink\n\nThey had pulled apart the ventilators. They had the control \u2014 parts of the ventilators that were helping people breathe, those were in the hallways so that nurses and respiratory therapists didn\u2019t have to go in and out as much and expose themselves to risk.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg What? speaker This is a disaster waiting to happen. dr. josh rosenberg Yes and no, though.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd the nurses were doing the same thing with IVs, with the tubing that the medicine flows through. So they had pulled the IV pumps out of the room so that they can not have to go in and out and use up the personal protective equipment.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg It\u2019s great. And yeah, I mean, you can trip over it.\n\nsheri fink\n\nYou all have to be very careful.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg You just have to be careful. sheri fink Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg Right. It\u2019s making the best of what you can do. sheri fink Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg OK, guys, can we start with number two? I appreciate everybody being here and everybody\u2019s support massively.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo now, Dr. Rosenberg is taking over for the doctors who were working the night before, and he\u2019s beginning to make his rounds.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Let\u2019s start with number two, and then just go around the unit please. All right, so lucky number two.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo nearly all the patients in the I.C.U. are on ventilators.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg So do we have any history of smoking, shisha use, anything like that?\n\nsheri fink\n\nSome have asthma. Some have diabetes.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. What did he do for a living? Occupational exposure?\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut a lot of these patients don\u2019t have any underlying conditions at all.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg I\u2019ll just write \u2014 because I mean, listen, on some of these you have a real reason why. You know, they may have bad lungs, and that makes it worse. Sometimes it\u2019s just the disease, but if there\u2019s something we can do to \u2014\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo Josh and the other doctors are kind of confounded by some of the patients. They don\u2019t understand why, if they don\u2019t have a lot of underlying health issues, why their lungs look so bad.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Crap. Reported any asthma?\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd they also just don\u2019t have that much to offer.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg OK. So what are we going to do with him? doctor Right now, we are \u2014 well, at this point, I\u2019m not too sure what we can do with him. We have \u2014 we tried to [VOICE FADES]. dr. josh rosenberg So what is he on drug-wise?\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo, I mean, for most patients, they\u2019re trying this thing called the Covid cocktail, which is that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. That\u2019s that combination the President talks about a lot.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg I don\u2019t think it\u2019s doing much.\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut there\u2019s really very little evidence, and Dr. Rosenberg in particular is very unsure that those drugs really help.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg We\u2019ll see about remdesivir, and we\u2019ll see if we get some Covid results and see what we can do.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo they start talking about other possibilities. There\u2019s this experimental drug called remdesivir that you have to apply to the manufacturer for each patient, and they have to meet certain criteria. You have to have a test result. They can\u2019t have certain complications.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg How do you guys feel about Kaletra or our other PIs? doctor They don\u2019t work at all.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere\u2019s another drug called Kaletra that doctors think might have some effect.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg The data\u2019s very \u2014 I mean, I think the data is very weak all over the place. That\u2019s the basic problem. So I always look at it as, where are you starting these drugs? It\u2019s near the end of a sporting event. You\u2019re down by a lot, and I don\u2019t care you throw out there, right? Even freaking Jordan couldn\u2019t recover that basketball game outside of Space Jam when you\u2019re down by 100 points and starting the fourth quarter. doctor That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think we should be giving it to patients who are already near the end.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo they kind of toss this around.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Yeah. And so we don\u2019t know. I mean, that\u2019s the point. We really just don\u2019t know our data, but like, so looking at this \u2014 yeah. So we\u2019ll figure out. We\u2019ll see if we get the remdesivir, which I doubt we\u2019ll be able to. We\u2019ll try to get a positive test result. Next. Let\u2019s move on along. OK. I.C.U. six. Going for c-section? doctor Supposedly today, yeah.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere was another Covid patient in the Intensive Care Unit on a ventilator, and she was pregnant, which adds a whole layer of complexity.\n\ndoctor She needs another dose of decadron, and then \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg Decadron? No. Beclomethasone. doctor Oh, sorry. Beclomethasone. Did I say decadron? dr. josh rosenberg Yes.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd they actually decided to deliver the baby by c-section two months before the due date. They had to give a couple of doses of steroid medication to help mature the baby\u2019s lungs. The whole goal was to save the mother\u2019s life, because I think part of it is that it gives more space for the lungs to expand once the baby is taken out.\n\ndoctor So if she\u2019s going for a c-section then she won\u2019t need remdesivir, right? dr. josh rosenberg I have no clue.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo far what\u2019s known is it tends to be quite rare that a baby would be born with Covid if the mom has it. At least that\u2019s what the early studies say.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. Number four. Number four. How are we doing here?\n\nsheri fink\n\nIt might be surprising how enthusiastic Dr. Rosenberg sounds while discussing these patients, but he\u2019s leading this team. He\u2019s trying to keep morale up.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. So I\u2019m going to stop here and head downstairs. Again, he\u2019s going to take six, seven, nine. Thank you. I will circle in with you guys. Good job. doctor Thank you. OK. dr. josh rosenberg Good job. doctor Oh, me?\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut actually, when we were going from one part of the I.C.U. to another \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Let\u2019s go downstairs. [SIGHS] I don\u2019t like taking the elevators.\n\nsheri fink\n\nHe runs into one of his medical students.\n\nsheri fink Hi, guys. dr. josh rosenberg How are you doing, buddy? doctor As best as I can. dr. josh rosenberg One, shouldn\u2019t you be home? doctor Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg Shouldn\u2019t you be home? doctor My mom\u2019s here. dr. josh rosenberg Oh, fuck. doctor I know. dr. josh rosenberg Which bed is she in on that side? doctor She\u2019s in 10. dr. josh rosenberg OK. I\u2019m rounding her now. doctor OK. May I speak to you at some point today when you have a chance? dr. josh rosenberg Call me at any point. All right? doctor Thanks, Doctor. Appreciate it. dr. josh rosenberg I\u2019ll see you later. Call me if you need anything, in all seriousness. You have my cell, right? doctor Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg Perfect. He\u2019s one of our medical students. He\u2019s been here forever. So we sent home all the medical students that rotate with us very early in this crisis, because I kind of looked at this and I said, one, we don\u2019t have enough PPE, you know, for all of the medical students that are coming through. And two \u2014 you know, I hate to say it like this \u2014 like, I don\u2019t want to expose them. They have enough time to get the living daylights scared out of them. sheri fink Right. dr. josh rosenberg [LAUGHS] Let them actually be students for a bit.\n\n[music]\n\n[AMBIENT VOICES]\n\ndoctor 1 I\u2019m going to give myself the option, because it\u2019s my clinic. doctor 2 OK, because tonight we\u2019re going to publish the new schedule, OK? dr. josh rosenberg Next patient. Santos. doctor Yeah. So this is our \u2014 she\u2019s our 54-year-old female, history of hypertension, came here with shortness of breath, fever, is admitted for acute hypoxic \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg She\u2019s the mom of our med student, right? doctor Yes. She\u2019s confirmed positive Covid.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd when we get to this medical student\u2019s mom, things are not looking good.\n\ndoctor Her FI, too, has been hovering between 100 to 80. I just want to make sure you know that she\u2019s not doing OK. dr. josh rosenberg She\u2019s not doing well. Um, yeah, I\u2019ll speak to the son. I know him pretty well. doctor Yeah he\u2019s in here always. dr. josh rosenberg Is he the next of kin? Is he the next of kin? He\u2019s the decision maker? doctor Right now he has family \u2014\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd Dr. Rosenberg wants to find out, is the son \u2014 is the medical student \u2014 the one who will be making decisions about her further treatment, about even possibly end of life care.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg But is he giving us consents? doctor Yes. dr. josh rosenberg Or does she have a husband? doctor Yeah, yeah. He\u2019s been giving consent. dr. josh rosenberg This is going to be hard, because he knows. He\u2019s a smart kid.\n\nsheri fink\n\nI mean, to me it sounded like he feels that this medical student, even though he\u2019s still a student, is enough of a doctor to understand that the prognosis isn\u2019t great \u2014 that perhaps his mom has some risk factors for this being more severe, and for her to possibly not make it.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg He\u2019s a good dude. He\u2019s a very sweet man, so we\u2019ll figure it out.\n\nsheri fink\n\nOf course, when it\u2019s your family member, it\u2019s not so simple.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. Here.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere are many cases where the doctors and the patient\u2019s families have very different views of how to proceed with treatment.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Covid? doctor Acute respiratory \u2014 yeah. Well, it\u2019s pending, but most likely. dr. josh rosenberg OK. So his pulmonary prognosis is horrible, right? doctor Yes. dr. josh rosenberg He\u2019s not getting better. doctor No, he\u2019s not. dr. josh rosenberg Blood gas is \u2014 doctor Not good enough. dr. josh rosenberg Not good, and he\u2019s on 100%. doctor Yes. dr. josh rosenberg So what does the fam want us to do? doctor The family wanted us to continue treatment. They agreed to the NI.\n\nsheri fink\n\nWhere the family still wants to press forward with all the intensive care available.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Right. So how many organ systems do we have down on him? We have our kidneys are down, our respiratory system\u2019s down, his cardiovascular is bad. He\u2019s on multi-organ system failure, right? So I have three out of my systems down already. His prognosis at that point, given his disease status, is just poor, unfortunately.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd where the doctors had come to a different conclusion and really felt like there wasn\u2019t much hope, and that in fact the goals of care should shift away from trying to extend life and much more toward comfort and end of life \u2014 accepting that the patient was likely going to die.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg And I hate to say it like this, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m able really to offer in terms of getting him back to where he was before. [SIGHS] Next.\n\n[music]\n\ndoctor\n\nCheck vitals from there too \u2014\n\nspeaker (on intercom) Attention, please. Attention, please. Code blue, 6B.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSuddenly, we hear this announcement go out over the hospital loudspeaker saying, code blue \u2014\n\nspeaker (on intercom) Code blue, 6B. [KNOCKING] doctor Josh?\n\nsheri fink\n\n\u2014 which means that somebody needs to be resuscitated, that they are basically dying.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg OK. It\u2019s code blue. you\u2019re on outreach or RESA? doctor RESA. sheri fink OK. All right. Can we follow you? doctor Yeah.\n\n[music]\n\n[AMBIENT CHATTER]\n\ndoctor 1 Covid or non-Covid? doctor 2 No, it\u2019s not Covid. doctor 3 OK.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo the code blue, it turned out, wasn\u2019t for a Covid patient, but for a patient who had other medical problems.\n\ndoctor 192. That\u2019s the code for 6A.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd they did CPR, and the patient survived.\n\ndoctor I got it. You\u2019re good.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd for me, the moment was really just highlighting the fact that, in a hospital, that that work goes on \u2014 that there are all these other patients, too, who have different medical problems, and people are still having other emergencies. So hospitals can\u2019t just stop being hospitals for everybody else. I But it\u2019s hard, because the number of patients with Covid is increasing. Usually, if you have people with a scary, infectious disease you would put them in specific rooms in the hospital, but, of course now there\u2019s many more patients than there are isolation rooms. So I think the doctors are very concerned about this possibility that somebody could come into the hospital for something else \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg She\u2019s Covid negative? doctor \u2014 and then, you know, catch Covid there. That\u2019s the real worst case scenario. dr. josh rosenberg She\u2019s not a Covid issue? doctor Not really, no. dr. josh rosenberg Let\u2019s try to get her the heck out of this unit, please. OK? Get her out.\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut of course, one of the big risks is to be a person who is walking into that hospital every day to work there.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Hello. Dr. Rosenberg speaking. I was paged.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd in fact, at one point \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Yes, yes, yes.\n\nsheri fink\n\nDr. Rosenberg gets word that one of his residents \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg He has Covid.\n\nsheri fink\n\n\u2014 tested positive for Covid and is in the emergency room downstairs.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Thanks. All right. What\u2019s up? You have his X-ray up? OK. I\u2019ll look at it in two seconds.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSomeone pulls up an X-ray of the resident\u2019s lungs for him to look at, and he peels off his Personal Protective Equipment, which in this case includes his own ski goggles, and he looks at the X-ray. And immediately, the tone shifts.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg That\u2019s shitty. I don\u2019t like that. I want him here. He is one to come up. doctor Yeah. Is that a \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg He comes right up, because he\u2019s high risk for getting intubated. doctor Yeah.\n\nsheri fink\n\nWhat he sees on the X-ray is something that looks bad to him.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg That\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about, because his X-ray looks crappy. doctor You know that he works here, right? Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg No. doctor It was just, like, let\u2019s just go back \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg He\u2019s one of our surgical residents. Bring him to the I.C.U.. Bring him here. Don\u2019t dilly. Don\u2019t \u2014 doctor No, no, I\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m just saying \u2014\n\nsheri fink\n\nI think what was really striking to him, or what sort of, like, shocked him was that this was another doctor.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg That is ours. That is one of us.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd close to his age, and somebody who\u2019s been doing the same kind of work that he\u2019s doing every day. And I think that shatters that sense of invulnerability.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg This is insanity. For my first day after being back from a week in this crap, holy shit.\n\nsheri fink\n\nI actually found out partway through that day that Dr. Rosenberg, himself, had been out the previous week with symptoms of Covid. He actually didn\u2019t get a test until his symptoms had resolved, and it turned out to be negative, but he\u2019s pretty sure he had Covid.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Well, one of the things we\u2019ll discuss that the nurse was telling you, but we need more nurses.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd this is a huge problem. A third of the doctors and nurses were out sick. A number of them had tested positive for Covid and were critically ill. And it\u2019s not just a problem for this hospital. It\u2019s a problem all over New York City, that as the hospitals are overwhelmed with Covid patients, you have high numbers of health staff out sick.\n\nandrew cuomo Good afternoon. Thank you all for taking the time for being here today. As Governor of New York, I am asking health care professionals across the country, if you don\u2019t have a health care crisis in your community, please come help us in New York now.\n\n[music]\n\nsheri fink\n\nThe day that I was at the hospital, New York Governor Cuomo pleaded for doctors and nurses and health care staff from around the U.S. to come to New York \u2014\n\nandrew cuomo We need relief. We need relief for doctors.

It says the exact opposite that the president said. It says, that would be a king. We would have had King George Washington.

This is Sheri. doctor 2 Sure. doctor 1 She\u2019s with The New York Times, and she\u2019s gonna spend some time here a little bit. doctor 2 Pleasure. doctor 1 It\u2019s up to you. doctor 2 I\u2019m fine with \u2014 sheri fink I\u2019m a physician. doctor 1 A physician and a writer.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo for the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been embedded in the Brooklyn Hospital Center.\n\ndoctor 1 I\u2019m going to finish rounding here, and then I\u2019m going to go downstairs and cover SI. doctor 2 OK.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd what I\u2019ve been able to see there is incredibly unique \u2014 what\u2019s happening? What is it like inside a hospital during a pandemic?\n\ndr. josh rosenberg \u2014 then we\u2019ll figure out the rest. doctor OK. All right. sheri fink Do you want to give him your mic, or are you willing to wear a mic?\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd there was one doctor I met who really embodied that transparency.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Does it beep every time I say a four-letter word like South Park?\n\nsheri fink\n\nDr. Josh Rosenberg.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg I am mildly inappropriate. I\u2019m just warning you.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAn attending physician in the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nsheri fink How are you, Peter? doctor Hi, how are you \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg I didn\u2019t see you hiding over there, my friend.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere are people from all over the hospital recruited to work in the I.C.U., so it\u2019s not just, like, I.C.U. doctors and nurses who are used to intensive care treatment, but in fact \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg And she\u2019s one of the podiatry residents, so all people who are good with knives and big needles.\n\nsheri fink\n\nWhen I was there that day, there was a podiatry doctor and two of her residents. Those are doctors who work on the feet.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg No, no, no. What I would like to do is that, as much as possible, we\u2019re going to try to get all of the Covids on one side, and then the whole area is a dirty area.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd the I.C.U. had actually effectively doubled in size, so it was completely full. And they had to turn to other areas of the hospital to turn them into Intensive Care Units. In fact, a big part of the I.C.U. is now in a place that just a few weeks ago was where patients would come for outpatient chemotherapy treatments. That\u2019s now in I.C.U..\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Frankie, watch out. Don\u2019t trip Don\u2019t trip Don\u2019t trip. Don\u2019t trip. Don\u2019t trip.\n\nsheri fink\n\nIt was also a bit of an obstacle course.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Don\u2019t trip.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere were cords everywhere.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Please be careful, Do you have gloves?\n\nsheri fink\n\nThey had pulled apart the ventilators. They had the control \u2014 parts of the ventilators that were helping people breathe, those were in the hallways so that nurses and respiratory therapists didn\u2019t have to go in and out as much and expose themselves to risk.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg What? speaker This is a disaster waiting to happen. dr. josh rosenberg Yes and no, though.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd the nurses were doing the same thing with IVs, with the tubing that the medicine flows through. So they had pulled the IV pumps out of the room so that they can not have to go in and out and use up the personal protective equipment.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg It\u2019s great. And yeah, I mean, you can trip over it.\n\nsheri fink\n\nYou all have to be very careful.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg You just have to be careful. sheri fink Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg Right. It\u2019s making the best of what you can do. sheri fink Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg OK, guys, can we start with number two? I appreciate everybody being here and everybody\u2019s support massively.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo now, Dr. Rosenberg is taking over for the doctors who were working the night before, and he\u2019s beginning to make his rounds.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Let\u2019s start with number two, and then just go around the unit please. All right, so lucky number two.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo nearly all the patients in the I.C.U. are on ventilators.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg So do we have any history of smoking, shisha use, anything like that?\n\nsheri fink\n\nSome have asthma. Some have diabetes.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. What did he do for a living? Occupational exposure?\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut a lot of these patients don\u2019t have any underlying conditions at all.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg I\u2019ll just write \u2014 because I mean, listen, on some of these you have a real reason why. You know, they may have bad lungs, and that makes it worse. Sometimes it\u2019s just the disease, but if there\u2019s something we can do to \u2014\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo Josh and the other doctors are kind of confounded by some of the patients. They don\u2019t understand why, if they don\u2019t have a lot of underlying health issues, why their lungs look so bad.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Crap. Reported any asthma?\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd they also just don\u2019t have that much to offer.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg OK. So what are we going to do with him? doctor Right now, we are \u2014 well, at this point, I\u2019m not too sure what we can do with him. We have \u2014 we tried to [VOICE FADES]. dr. josh rosenberg So what is he on drug-wise?\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo, I mean, for most patients, they\u2019re trying this thing called the Covid cocktail, which is that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. That\u2019s that combination the President talks about a lot.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg I don\u2019t think it\u2019s doing much.\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut there\u2019s really very little evidence, and Dr. Rosenberg in particular is very unsure that those drugs really help.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg We\u2019ll see about remdesivir, and we\u2019ll see if we get some Covid results and see what we can do.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo they start talking about other possibilities. There\u2019s this experimental drug called remdesivir that you have to apply to the manufacturer for each patient, and they have to meet certain criteria. You have to have a test result. They can\u2019t have certain complications.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg How do you guys feel about Kaletra or our other PIs? doctor They don\u2019t work at all.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere\u2019s another drug called Kaletra that doctors think might have some effect.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg The data\u2019s very \u2014 I mean, I think the data is very weak all over the place. That\u2019s the basic problem. So I always look at it as, where are you starting these drugs? It\u2019s near the end of a sporting event. You\u2019re down by a lot, and I don\u2019t care you throw out there, right? Even freaking Jordan couldn\u2019t recover that basketball game outside of Space Jam when you\u2019re down by 100 points and starting the fourth quarter. doctor That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think we should be giving it to patients who are already near the end.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo they kind of toss this around.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Yeah. And so we don\u2019t know. I mean, that\u2019s the point. We really just don\u2019t know our data, but like, so looking at this \u2014 yeah. So we\u2019ll figure out. We\u2019ll see if we get the remdesivir, which I doubt we\u2019ll be able to. We\u2019ll try to get a positive test result. Next. Let\u2019s move on along. OK. I.C.U. six. Going for c-section? doctor Supposedly today, yeah.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere was another Covid patient in the Intensive Care Unit on a ventilator, and she was pregnant, which adds a whole layer of complexity.\n\ndoctor She needs another dose of decadron, and then \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg Decadron? No. Beclomethasone. doctor Oh, sorry. Beclomethasone. Did I say decadron? dr. josh rosenberg Yes.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd they actually decided to deliver the baby by c-section two months before the due date. They had to give a couple of doses of steroid medication to help mature the baby\u2019s lungs. The whole goal was to save the mother\u2019s life, because I think part of it is that it gives more space for the lungs to expand once the baby is taken out.\n\ndoctor So if she\u2019s going for a c-section then she won\u2019t need remdesivir, right? dr. josh rosenberg I have no clue.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo far what\u2019s known is it tends to be quite rare that a baby would be born with Covid if the mom has it. At least that\u2019s what the early studies say.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. Number four. Number four. How are we doing here?\n\nsheri fink\n\nIt might be surprising how enthusiastic Dr. Rosenberg sounds while discussing these patients, but he\u2019s leading this team. He\u2019s trying to keep morale up.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. So I\u2019m going to stop here and head downstairs. Again, he\u2019s going to take six, seven, nine. Thank you. I will circle in with you guys. Good job. doctor Thank you. OK. dr. josh rosenberg Good job. doctor Oh, me?\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut actually, when we were going from one part of the I.C.U. to another \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Let\u2019s go downstairs. [SIGHS] I don\u2019t like taking the elevators.\n\nsheri fink\n\nHe runs into one of his medical students.\n\nsheri fink Hi, guys. dr. josh rosenberg How are you doing, buddy? doctor As best as I can. dr. josh rosenberg One, shouldn\u2019t you be home? doctor Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg Shouldn\u2019t you be home? doctor My mom\u2019s here. dr. josh rosenberg Oh, fuck. doctor I know. dr. josh rosenberg Which bed is she in on that side? doctor She\u2019s in 10. dr. josh rosenberg OK. I\u2019m rounding her now. doctor OK. May I speak to you at some point today when you have a chance? dr. josh rosenberg Call me at any point. All right? doctor Thanks, Doctor. Appreciate it. dr. josh rosenberg I\u2019ll see you later. Call me if you need anything, in all seriousness. You have my cell, right? doctor Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg Perfect. He\u2019s one of our medical students. He\u2019s been here forever. So we sent home all the medical students that rotate with us very early in this crisis, because I kind of looked at this and I said, one, we don\u2019t have enough PPE, you know, for all of the medical students that are coming through. And two \u2014 you know, I hate to say it like this \u2014 like, I don\u2019t want to expose them. They have enough time to get the living daylights scared out of them. sheri fink Right. dr. josh rosenberg [LAUGHS] Let them actually be students for a bit.\n\n[music]\n\n[AMBIENT VOICES]\n\ndoctor 1 I\u2019m going to give myself the option, because it\u2019s my clinic. doctor 2 OK, because tonight we\u2019re going to publish the new schedule, OK? dr. josh rosenberg Next patient.

She\u2019s confirmed positive Covid.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd when we get to this medical student\u2019s mom, things are not looking good.\n\ndoctor Her FI, too, has been hovering between 100 to 80. I just want to make sure you know that she\u2019s not doing OK. dr. josh rosenberg She\u2019s not doing well. Um, yeah, I\u2019ll speak to the son. I know him pretty well. doctor Yeah he\u2019s in here always. dr. josh rosenberg Is he the next of kin? Is he the next of kin? He\u2019s the decision maker? doctor Right now he has family \u2014\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd Dr. Rosenberg wants to find out, is the son \u2014 is the medical student \u2014 the one who will be making decisions about her further treatment, about even possibly end of life care.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg But is he giving us consents? doctor Yes. dr. josh rosenberg Or does she have a husband? doctor Yeah, yeah. He\u2019s been giving consent. dr. josh rosenberg This is going to be hard, because he knows. He\u2019s a smart kid.\n\nsheri fink\n\nI mean, to me it sounded like he feels that this medical student, even though he\u2019s still a student, is enough of a doctor to understand that the prognosis isn\u2019t great \u2014 that perhaps his mom has some risk factors for this being more severe, and for her to possibly not make it.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg He\u2019s a good dude. He\u2019s a very sweet man, so we\u2019ll figure it out.\n\nsheri fink\n\nOf course, when it\u2019s your family member, it\u2019s not so simple.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg All right. Here.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThere are many cases where the doctors and the patient\u2019s families have very different views of how to proceed with treatment.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Covid? doctor Acute respiratory \u2014 yeah. Well, it\u2019s pending, but most likely. dr. josh rosenberg OK. So his pulmonary prognosis is horrible, right? doctor Yes. dr. josh rosenberg He\u2019s not getting better. doctor No, he\u2019s not. dr. josh rosenberg Blood gas is \u2014 doctor Not good enough. dr. josh rosenberg Not good, and he\u2019s on 100%. doctor Yes. dr. josh rosenberg So what does the fam want us to do? doctor The family wanted us to continue treatment. They agreed to the NI.\n\nsheri fink\n\nWhere the family still wants to press forward with all the intensive care available.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Right. So how many organ systems do we have down on him? We have our kidneys are down, our respiratory system\u2019s down, his cardiovascular is bad. He\u2019s on multi-organ system failure, right? So I have three out of my systems down already. His prognosis at that point, given his disease status, is just poor, unfortunately.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd where the doctors had come to a different conclusion and really felt like there wasn\u2019t much hope, and that in fact the goals of care should shift away from trying to extend life and much more toward comfort and end of life \u2014 accepting that the patient was likely going to die.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg And I hate to say it like this, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m able really to offer in terms of getting him back to where he was before. [SIGHS] Next.\n\n[music]\n\ndoctor\n\nCheck vitals from there too \u2014\n\nspeaker (on intercom) Attention, please. Attention, please. Code blue, 6B.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSuddenly, we hear this announcement go out over the hospital loudspeaker saying, code blue \u2014\n\nspeaker (on intercom) Code blue, 6B. [KNOCKING] doctor Josh?\n\nsheri fink\n\n\u2014 which means that somebody needs to be resuscitated, that they are basically dying.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg OK. It\u2019s code blue. you\u2019re on outreach or RESA? doctor RESA. sheri fink OK. All right. Can we follow you? doctor Yeah.\n\n[music]\n\n[AMBIENT CHATTER]\n\ndoctor 1 Covid or non-Covid? doctor 2 No, it\u2019s not Covid. doctor 3 OK.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo the code blue, it turned out, wasn\u2019t for a Covid patient, but for a patient who had other medical problems.\n\ndoctor 192. That\u2019s the code for 6A.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd they did CPR, and the patient survived.\n\ndoctor I got it. You\u2019re good.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd for me, the moment was really just highlighting the fact that, in a hospital, that that work goes on \u2014 that there are all these other patients, too, who have different medical problems, and people are still having other emergencies. So hospitals can\u2019t just stop being hospitals for everybody else. I But it\u2019s hard, because the number of patients with Covid is increasing. Usually, if you have people with a scary, infectious disease you would put them in specific rooms in the hospital, but, of course now there\u2019s many more patients than there are isolation rooms. So I think the doctors are very concerned about this possibility that somebody could come into the hospital for something else \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg She\u2019s Covid negative? doctor \u2014 and then, you know, catch Covid there. That\u2019s the real worst case scenario. dr. josh rosenberg She\u2019s not a Covid issue? doctor Not really, no. dr. josh rosenberg Let\u2019s try to get her the heck out of this unit, please. OK? Get her out.\n\nsheri fink\n\nBut of course, one of the big risks is to be a person who is walking into that hospital every day to work there.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Hello. Dr. Rosenberg speaking. I was paged.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd in fact, at one point \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Yes, yes, yes.\n\nsheri fink\n\nDr. Rosenberg gets word that one of his residents \u2014\n\ndr. josh rosenberg He has Covid.\n\nsheri fink\n\n\u2014 tested positive for Covid and is in the emergency room downstairs.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Thanks. All right. What\u2019s up? You have his X-ray up? OK. I\u2019ll look at it in two seconds.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSomeone pulls up an X-ray of the resident\u2019s lungs for him to look at, and he peels off his Personal Protective Equipment, which in this case includes his own ski goggles, and he looks at the X-ray. And immediately, the tone shifts.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg That\u2019s shitty. I don\u2019t like that. I want him here. He is one to come up. doctor Yeah. Is that a \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg He comes right up, because he\u2019s high risk for getting intubated. doctor Yeah.\n\nsheri fink\n\nWhat he sees on the X-ray is something that looks bad to him.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg That\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about, because his X-ray looks crappy. doctor You know that he works here, right? Yeah. dr. josh rosenberg No. doctor It was just, like, let\u2019s just go back \u2014 dr. josh rosenberg He\u2019s one of our surgical residents. Bring him to the I.C.U.. Bring him here. Don\u2019t dilly. Don\u2019t \u2014 doctor No, no, I\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m just saying \u2014\n\nsheri fink\n\nI think what was really striking to him, or what sort of, like, shocked him was that this was another doctor.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg That is ours. That is one of us.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd close to his age, and somebody who\u2019s been doing the same kind of work that he\u2019s doing every day. And I think that shatters that sense of invulnerability.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg This is insanity. For my first day after being back from a week in this crap, holy shit.\n\nsheri fink\n\nI actually found out partway through that day that Dr. Rosenberg, himself, had been out the previous week with symptoms of Covid. He actually didn\u2019t get a test until his symptoms had resolved, and it turned out to be negative, but he\u2019s pretty sure he had Covid.\n\ndr. josh rosenberg Well, one of the things we\u2019ll discuss that the nurse was telling you, but we need more nurses.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd this is a huge problem. A third of the doctors and nurses were out sick. A number of them had tested positive for Covid and were critically ill. And it\u2019s not just a problem for this hospital. It\u2019s a problem all over New York City, that as the hospitals are overwhelmed with Covid patients, you have high numbers of health staff out sick.\n\nandrew cuomo Good afternoon.

I mean, he\u2019s only five years younger than me, you know? I\u2019m 45, like half of our patients upstairs. We have 40-year-olds who are intubated. Jesus. Geez. [GROANS] Man, this is brutal.

They say we lack the materials, as well as the reagents for chemical analysis, the delivery infrastructure and the machines to run so many tests.\n\nMr. Romer is not dissuaded. \u201cI\u2019ve been focused on a single idea my whole career, that just because something is unfamiliar doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cBuilding interstate highways, scanning every book, going to the moon \u2014 these were all outrageous ideas at one time. But if we put enough resources and our minds behind it, we are able to make the impossible possible.\u201d\n\nHis plan would rely less on contact tracing and isolation, since everyone would be tested regularly, and this might make infection control easier in many parts of the country. Contact tracing requires significant infrastructure and is hard to do well.\n\n\u201cWe spend something like $700 billion a year to protect us against military threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are at greater risk from a biological threat at the moment than any military threat. We should be prepared to spend at least a hundred billion a year not only to protect us against this virus, but any potential new viruses that could threaten us in the future.\u201d\n\nThe Center for American Progress plan that leans on monitoring via your phone.\n\nOther ambitious ideas can be found in a plan from the Center for American Progress, written by Dr. Emanuel and colleagues. Part of the proposal is an enormous information technology monitoring system. It would call for all Americans to download apps to their phones that would monitor where they go and whom they get near, which would allow contact tracing to be done instantaneously. Everyone could sign in electronically before using public transportation, entering large buildings or schools or gathering in groups above a certain number. They even propose requiring the app to be downloaded in order to receive test results. In an ideal situation, it would run in the background, regardless of whether users signed in.\n\n\u201cIf we could do real-time contact tracing based on a person\u2019s phone and GPS signals, and alert people that they have been exposed to a Covid-19 positive person,\u201d that would greatly ease the containment strategy, he said.\n\nOf course, such a system would be considered a large intrusion on privacy, and it\u2019s not clear it is politically feasible \u2014 or even legal. Additionally, not every American has a smartphone.\n\nThe PolicyLab focus on universal community-level surveillance.\n\nMeredith Matone, scientific director of PolicyLab and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, says we may need to get away from testing to more grass-roots approaches.", "author": ["Aaron E.

But by living among the animals, in their world, Safina and the field scientists he visits show us something else, something too often overlooked in research and in conservation: who the animals are, and how they live. Though researchers study \u201cspecies,\u201d this category is less interesting than thinking in terms of families and communities, each making its way at a particular pace and in a particular place. More compelling than facts about species are tales of individuals \u2014 characters, with personality \u2014 living among peers or kin. So it\u2019s the stories of Safina\u2019s days with these animals that move us: the distinctive rhythms of the whales\u2019 \u201cvertical lives\u201d (they travel from surface to depths to hunt, and sleep vertically); the social complexities of chimpanzee life; the sometime silliness of macaw life, as when the birds \u201cgoof off\u201d together, hanging upside down.\n\n\u201cTo truly comprehend any creature \u2014 including people \u2014 you must watch them live on their own terms,\u201d Safina writes. To find the whales, researchers drop a hydrophone into the water and listen through the zillion sounds of the ocean for the distinctive sonar clicks or characteristic codas, group names, of sperm whales, then head in their direction where the whales may be a mile below, or not there at all. It goes on like this for days, sometimes without finding one \u2014 and these are the expert whale-finders. The difficulty in merely locating them is an apt metaphor for the profound distance we have from these animals\u2019 worlds, from an understanding of them that is anywhere near complete.\n\nThe paradox of trying to get others to appreciate wild animals\u2019 lives is that often we have to simply let them be: not cage them, hunt them, gawk at them.

So what\u2019s your next step?\u201d \u201cBefore Covid-19, I would recommend putting you on a breathing machine.\u201d \u201cI would have rushed to intubate.\u201d \u201cBecause that was probably the right thing to do.\u201d \u201cI know when to put in a breathing tube. I\u2019ve worked long enough, and I\u2019ve worked enough places with enough people. But in this disease, it is extremely confusing, you know, it just doesn\u2019t make sense. Listen, I stocked up for the apocalypse, like most people. Now, I just can\u2019t believe that I ever thought that I\u2019d somehow be home to make all my frozen food. On a normal day in an I.C.U., you have very sick patients. Patients will \u2014 are dying, but this is just different. It\u2019s just \u2014 you have a disease we don\u2019t understand that is very deadly with patients that are scared and staff that are scared, and on top of that, it does not appear that we have a good treatment strategy other than a ventilator. And we don\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019re not sure when to put a breathing tube in. The crux of it is, we don\u2019t want to put a breathing tube into someone who doesn\u2019t need it knowing that there\u2019s a 70 percent chance they\u2019ll die, and then we don\u2019t want to not put it into someone who would need it too late. When you go to the E.R., and there\u2019s like 40 people that need oxygen, and they all look terrible, but they can all talk to you.\u201d \u201cAnd no apparent distress whatsoever.\u201d \u201cAnd then you get them on a monitor, and you look up, and you see this oxygen saturation of 45 percent or 50 percent.\u201d \u201cAnd telling myself this is impossible. This is not possible. How can this be?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just not compatible with life to have an oxygen saturation that low.\u201d \u201cYou know, this is strange. It\u2019s out of a horror movie.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been unable to sleep because I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around it. This goes against anything I\u2019ve ever believed.\u201d \u201cThe paradigm of ARDS is not matching with the patients that I\u2019m seeing, so it\u2019s like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\u201d \u201cThe core of the core of the core \u2014 it is just, what disease are we treating? And are we treating something that is naturally ARDS, or are we not?\u201d \u201cWe protect the lung against what we do to the lung. Protect it from what? From what we do in mechanical ventilation.\u201d \u201cSo what he is saying is that we just have to be gentle. People will need a ventilator, and those that do need as high oxygen as possible, as little pressure as possible, in order to buy time until this demon virus stops.\u201d \u201cThese patients have ARDS. I think the editorial has both been misinterpreted, and I think people have misunderstood that it\u2019s just that. It\u2019s an editorial. It\u2019s not a study and it\u2019s not a trial. I don\u2019t doubt that people have seen some cases with some terrifyingly low oxygen numbers. On average, they\u2019re as sick as prior cohorts with ARDS.\u201d \u201cI just think it\u2019s important to say that it\u2019s not a settled question. Every hospital in the world is probably solving its problems slightly differently.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re using an early intubation strategy here, and of our first 66 patients, already a third of them have been extubated. I\u2019m arguing for evidence-based medicine, which is something that we all purported to agree with before this outbreak hit. We have large, randomized, controlled trials. The patients in those trials had met the same diagnostic criteria that our current patients meet. We should apply the results of the trials.\u201d \u201cToday, we do not rush to intubate. Intubate shouldn\u2019t \u2014 has become the last resort, and the protocol once they\u2019re intubated has changed drastically.\u201d \u201cSo within the last two weeks, I mean, what has been unacceptable has become very acceptable. Some of these patients don\u2019t need to be intubated. You watch them carefully. You make sure their oxygenation is adequate, and they can recover.\u201d \u201cI am not saying we don\u2019t need ventilators, but perhaps we need to think about how we\u2019re using them. Somebody, and preferably people that are not taking care of patients every day, needs to look at the disease and figure out how we can treat it better.\u201d \u201cThe truth will come out eventually. In the meantime, the question is: What do we do until that happens? And yes, I\u2019m nervous.

In addition, anyone who came within six feet of an employee with potential exposure should be notified and considered to have also been exposed.\n\nLabor advocates like Marcy Goldstein-Gelb, the co-executive director of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, say the new guidelines may encourage employers to pressure workers to return to their jobs too soon, often without adequate protection or pay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complete reversal of the policy that the C.D.C. has for the public,\u201d Ms. Goldstein-Gelb said. \u201cIt disregards the fact that, right now, workers are dying every day needlessly in unconscionable numbers.\u201d\n\nGrocery stores are among the remaining high-risk transmission points for the disease now that many other commercial businesses have been closed. The employees are in regular contact with customers at checkout, behind counters and as they stock shelves along the aisles.

The C.D.C. recommended in early April that everyone wear cloth face coverings in stores, but the policy is voluntary.\n\nWorkers are also imploring customers to take more care while in stores. They say many have been throwing used gloves and wipes in carts and on floors for employees to pick up.

But now Libya faces the coronavirus pandemic. Now life in this conflict zone that seemed like it couldn\u2019t get any worse, suddenly has in just a matter of weeks. \u201cThe war should stop in order to have a better chance of dealing with the virus. It doesn\u2019t mean that we will easily beat it.\u201d But the war hasn\u2019t stopped.

There are 25 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Libya as of April 12, but testing is extremely limited, and the number is likely to grow. In the capital of Tripoli, residents face a dire choice: Do they stay in their homes and risk getting hit by shells or do they flee and risk contracting the virus? \u201cEveryone\u2019s worried.

People are just lost.\u201d Libya\u2019s civil war began six years ago. And the fighting is between two main groups: the U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord, based in the capital of Tripoli, and the Libyan National Army led by a military strongman who\u2019s based in Benghazi to the east. For the past year, the L.N.A. has been attacking Tripoli on its push to control the country. The front line has moved into the suburbs, sending residents fleeing deeper into the city, crowding closer together. We spoke to one resident who\u2019s had to move twice, from this area further and further into the dense city. She asked that we only use her voice. These conditions will likely make it much easier for the virus to spread. When the pandemic began, both sides of the conflict imposed curfews. They readied hospitals and public areas. They put on masks and continued fighting. Eventually they agreed to pause the fighting because of the virus, but the agreement didn\u2019t last. The L.N.A. had pledged on Facebook to halt its advance on Tripoli \u2026 \u2026 but we found that its forces resumed attacks on the city within minutes. And just one day after the first confirmed coronavirus case was announced, the L.N.A. began its worst shelling on residential areas that anyone could remember, despite the fact that people were clearly stuck in their homes under curfew and self-quarantine. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so close to death as I am feeling right now, right here in Tripoli.

It\u2019s not just people at home being hit. It\u2019s doctors at work too. The L.N.A. has rarely attacked major civilian hospitals over the past year, but since the pandemic, one hospital complex has been struck three times in less than a week. The hospital was well known for treating coronavirus patients. It was evacuated and forced to briefly close. The international community condemned the hospital attacks, but to little effect. The war continues to rage. One analysis found that violence in Tripoli over the past year has spiked during the pandemic. \u201cAnd the fighters, I mean, you cannot really quarantine them. They are moving from a city to another. Despite the situation that we have, they are going to take their share of the hospitals\u2019 beds, and that will make dealing with coronavirus patients even harder.\u201d Some international aid has reached Libya, but the world at large is mostly focused elsewhere on fighting the pandemic in their own countries.

It\u2019s nice while it lasts, but it probably won\u2019t end well.\n\nIn fact, according to contrarian analysis, this sentiment situation is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the wall of worry that bull markets like to climb. It\u2019s more akin to the slope of hope that bear markets like to descend.\n\nConsider the bullishness that now prevails among the short-term market timing newsletters tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest. Their average recommended equity exposure right now stands at 56.6%, according to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index (HSNSI). That\u2019s 45 percentage points higher than the exposure level that prevailed just 12 trading sessions ago, in late August.\n\nThat\u2019s an awfully quick jump back on the bullish bandwagon by the typical market timer. In fact, the HSNSI is now higher than where it stood at the market\u2019s all-time high in early August \u2014 right before the stock market\u2019s August pullback (see chart).\n\nThis is a textbook illustration of what happens when Wall Street adopts a \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d attitude.\n\nFormer Lehman employees rock out\n\nIf the market really thought it would be so awful if Larry Summers were Fed chairman, then it should have fallen as it looked increasingly likely that he would be appointed. That would have especially been true this past Friday, following a report from Japan\u2019s Nikkei newspaper that President Obama had decided to appoint Summers.\n\nFar from falling, however, the market rose on Friday \u2014 both at the open, right after that story appeared on the wires, and for the rest of the day as well.\n\nIndeed, Friday\u2019s action led some analysts to complain Friday that the market had yet to price in what they referred to as the \u201cSummers put.\u201d Never mind, though, logic has nothing to do with this market: It still rallied on Monday as though it had priced in that put.\n\nThe same has been true recently for other potentially bad news, such as Syria. The market shrugs off the initial threat of that bad news, and yet its removal is taken as the occasion for rallying.\n\nThe contrarian-based worry about this sentiment situation is that the market is being held up more by a happy mood than by a solid assessment of the fundamentals. As a result, the market will fall all the more precipitously when investors\u2019 mood begins to sour \u2014 as it eventually will.\n\nAnd though investor psychology is difficult to analyze, we know investors are notoriously fickle. Will it be paralysis in Washington over the debt ceiling that causes them to become less exuberant? A worsening of the Syria mess? Most likely, it will be something that comes out of left field that isn\u2019t even on our radar right now.\n\nThe one thing we do know is that, when that souring does happen, the market\u2019s lofty level will not be receiving much support from the fundamentals.\n\nBuyer beware.\n\nClick here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/ayrWz1FSrQE/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-12T18:28:34", "title": "Picking a perfect dividend portfolio", "text": "CHAPEL HILL. N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 When it comes to dividends, more isn\u2019t always better: A company isn\u2019t necessarily more attractive just because it pays a higher dividend.\n\nThat is the clear lesson I draw from the dividend-oriented newsletter with the best long-term record among the 200 services in the Hulbert Financial Digest rankings: Investment Quality Trends, edited by Kelley Wright. \u201cHigher\u201d or \u201clower\u201d for him only have meaning when comparing a company\u2019s current dividend with what it paid in the past. He believes that comparisons with other companies are unhelpful.\n\nConsider CVS Caremark Corp. CVS, +3.30% , the drug retailer, and HCP Inc. US:HCP , the health-care real-estate investment trust. Wright rates CVS Caremark more highly than HCP, even though CVS\u2019s dividend yield \u2014 the annual dividend as a percentage of the stock price \u2014 is just 1.6%, while HCP has a 4.1% yield.\n\nWright believes CVS is the better bet because its current yield is at the high end of the range of its past yields, which have extended from a low of 0.4% to its current 1.6%. HCP\u2019s current yield, by contrast, is at the low end of its historical range, which has gotten as high as 12.4%. So, in terms of relative dividend yield, CVS\u2019s is higher than HCP\u2019s.\n\nHidden gems from the '70s\n\nOver the years, Wright has found that high yields come back down to earth and low yields rise back toward the midpoint of their historical range. That would be bad news for HCP, since a likely cause of its yield rising would be a falling stock price \u2014 which could lead to losses that more than eliminate the benefit of the high yield.\n\nFor CVS, by contrast, Wright believes the path of least resistance is for its yield to decline because its stock price rises.\n\nTo be sure, CVS\u2019s yield also would come down if the company cuts its dividend, which would be bad for its stock price. Wright therefore focuses his analysis only on companies with strong balance sheets and a long and consistent pattern of higher earnings and increasing dividends.\n\nThink before you grab those Ivy hunks\n\nSo how has Wright\u2019s strategy performed over time? According to the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s calculations, Investment Quality Trends over the past three decades has beaten the dividend-adjusted return of the entire U.S. stock market by an average of 1.2 percentage points a year \u2014 while nevertheless incurring less risk.\n\nThat is a winning combination: The service is in second place for risk-adjusted performance among the three dozen advisers for which track records extend back that far.\n\nWright\u2019s strategy is to be distinguished from the traditional approach to picking dividend stocks, which focuses on absolute rather than relative yield.\n\nOne popular variant of the traditional approach is the so-called Dogs of the Dow strategy, in which investors buy the 10 stocks among the 30 Dow Industrials DJIA, +0.14% with the highest yields. For example, the three Dow \u201cdogs\u201d that currently have the highest yields are two telecommunication companies, AT&T T, +0.23% (4.7%) and Verizon Communications VZ, +1.28% (4.1%), and tech giant Intel INTC, +3.26% (4.1%).\n\nDespite investing in stocks with yields this high, however, the strategy has disappointed recently. Over the past five years (through March 31), it has produced a 5.0% annualized return, lagging the 5.9% dividend-adjusted return of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.58% and barely half the 10.8% return of a portfolio that is periodically updated to always contain just the 10 stocks that Wright recommends most highly.\n\nAnother variant of the traditional focus on absolute yield can be found in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index. It contains the 50 highest-yielding stocks among the S&P 1500 Composite index that also have a long history of dividend increases.\n\nThe index\u2019s two largest components currently are Pitney Bowes (the mail and document-services company, with a 10.0% yield) and biotech company AbbVie (yielding 3.7%).\n\nThough the performance of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats index in recent years has been better than that of the Dogs of the Dow strategy, it still lags behind that of Investment Quality Trends. Over the past five years, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, +0.16% , which is benchmarked to the index, has produced an annual dividend-adjusted return of 9.2% through March 31 \u2014 nearly two percentage points a year lower than the portfolio of Wright\u2019s 10 most attractive dividend stocks.\n\nNote carefully that this Wright portfolio currently holds none of the stocks that are at the top of the holdings list for either the Dogs of the Dow or the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. In addition to CVS Caremark, the following nine stocks are in Wright\u2019s portfolio: Air Products & Chemicals APD, -0.44% (yielding 3.3%), Archer Daniels Midland ADM, +0.47% (2.3%), Coca-Cola KO, -1.07% (2.7%), ConocoPhillips COP, -3.50% (4.4%), Occidental Petroleum OXY, -10.36% (3.2%), PepsiCo PEP, +0.45% (2.7%), Reliance Steel & Aluminum RS, -0.26% (1.7%), Texas Instruments TXN, +3.15% (3.1%) and Walgreen US:WAG (2.3%).\n\nThe average yield of all 10 stocks is 2.7%, versus 2.0% for the S&P 500 as a whole. And, even better, if Wright is right: These 10 have the potential to outperform the S&P 500 on a price-appreciation basis as well.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/nPEYyo38O6s/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-01T10:01:19", "title": "Car companies stuck in slow lane", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

An adviser is deemed to be a \u201ctop performer\u201d if he jumps over two hurdles: First, he must in the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s ranking have beaten a buy-and-hold in the stock market over the last 15 years. Secondly, he must be among the 15 of these long-term market beaters with the best returns over the last 12 months.\n\nThe accompanying table lists how many buy recommendations come from these 15 top advisers for any of four prominent auto makers.\n\nTo put the data in this table into perspective, the stock that currently is most recommended by select group of top performers \u2014 Pfizer \u2014 is recommended for purchase by 7 (or about one of every two of them, on average). The two auto makers that garner any buy recommendations from the top performers don\u2019t come anywhere close to that kind of popularity: Currently there are 75 other stocks in addition to Pfizer that those top performers like more.\n\nNote carefully, furthermore, that there are no other auto makers besides these four that the top performers like any better. The simple fact is that they are not crazy about the industry, period.\n\nWhat industries do the top performers particularly like right now? The table below shows which have received the greatest number of upgrades in recent weeks from those top performers.\n\n# recent upgrades from top performers Semiconductors 7 Medical Equipment 5 Banks 4 Software 4\n\nAs you can see from the sectors listed in the table, there is nothing even remotely associated with or correlated with the auto industry.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean that this industry won\u2019t do well, or that it automatically should be avoided. But you should know that if you do decide to invest in it, you will not have much, if any, support from the top performing advisers.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/geDvYWw8ou8/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-18T19:14:56", "title": "Beware the Great Rotation", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 The most cited bullish argument these days, at least among the couple of hundred investment advisers I monitor, is that the stock market will \u201cmelt up\u201d as investors sour on bonds and transfer the trillions they have in fixed-income mutual funds into stock funds.\n\nI suppose it is conceivable. But a careful review of historical fund patterns doesn\u2019t provide much support for this so-called Great Rotation argument.\n\nConsider the share of all mutual-fund assets (excluding money-market funds) that are allocated to either stocks or bonds. According to data provided by the Investment Company Institute in Washington, the equity share at the end of 2012 stood at 65.7%. That is only marginally lower than the 71% average of all comparable monthly readings since 1970.\n\nGiven that pattern, it is difficult to make the case that average fund investors are allocating an abnormally low share of their assets to stocks \u2014 or that they are about to increase that share.\n\nOther mutual-fund data cast doubt on the Great Rotation as well.\n\nPaper or plastic? Dollar bills, that is!\n\nConsider 1987, arguably the period over the past three decades most relevant to the Great Rotation argument today. Then, as now, a bull market was getting long in the tooth. Beginning in April of that year, following more than 60 months in which fund investors had invested an average of nearly $4 billion a month of new money in bonds, they reversed course in a big way. Over the next six months, according to the ICI data, fund investors withdrew an average of $3 billion a month from bond funds.\n\nAs market historians recall, the stock market that year topped out in August, four months after that trend reversal. And the 1987 crash \u2014 the worst one-day drop in U.S. stock-market history \u2014 occurred two months after that. Far from inaugurating a new bull market for stocks, that reversal in fund investors\u2019 opinion about bonds came right before a major stock-market top.\n\nAnother reason to question the Great Rotation argument is that any positive impact on the stock market is likely to be short-term at best. That, at least, is the finding of a study, \u201cMeasuring Investment Sentiment with Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d published last May in the Journal of Financial Economics.\n\nThe authors found that even though the stock market often rises as investors shift assets from bond funds to stock funds, almost all of that increase is reversed within four months\u2019 time.\n\nThe Great Rotation stock-market melt-up hypothesis also would have to fly in the face of well-documented seasonal trading patterns. A study presented in December at the Australasian Finance & Banking Conference in Sydney, \u201cSeasonal Asset Allocation: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d found that U.S. fund investors on average transfer assets from stock to bond funds during the winter months \u2014 and do just the reverse in summer.\n\nAs followers of the famous \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d seasonal pattern will recognize, the implication of this new research is that the stock market on balance has performed better when the direction of fund flows between stocks and bonds is in precisely the opposite direction of what\u2019s presumed by the Great Rotation argument.\n\nEven if a Great Rotation out of bonds comes to pass, it doesn\u2019t mean investors will move all of that money into stocks.\n\nIn fact, they probably would put much of it in boring old money-market funds, according to Claude Erb, a former fixed-income fund manager at Trust Co. of the West.\n\nInvestors are reluctant to transfer funds between one asset class and another, Erb says. Since they typically consider money-market funds to be in the fixed-income asset class, money funds most likely would be the primary beneficiary of bond-fund redemptions, he says \u2014 especially since the higher interest rates that make bond funds less attractive would make money funds more so.\n\nIf these patterns are any guide to the future, now might be the time to pull back from stocks rather than dive in. As Russ Wermers, a University of Maryland finance professor and one of the authors of the research presented at the December conference, puts it: \u201cFor most investors, the more proper response to the fund flow premise of the Great Rotation argument is probably to reduce equity exposure rather than allocate new sums to equities.\u201d", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/3FYsOI8GjSk/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-06T12:30:38", "title": "Insiders now aggressively bearish", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 Corporate insiders are aggressively selling their shares.\n\nThis is worrisome because corporate insiders \u2014 officers, directors and the largest shareholders \u2014 presumably know more about their companies\u2019 prospects than the rest of us do. If they were confident that the shares of their companies would soon be trading markedly higher, they wouldn\u2019t be selling them now.\n\nYet selling they are \u2014 at an alarming pace.\n\nConsider an insider indicator calculated by the Vickers Weekly Insider Report, published by Argus Research. The indicator is a ratio of all shares that insiders have recently sold in the open market to the number that they have purchased.\n\nFor the week that ended last Friday, this sell-to-buy ratio for NYSE-listed shares listed stood at 9.20-to-1. That means insiders of these companies, on average, were selling more than nine shares of their firms\u2019 stock for every one that they were buying.\n\nMutual funds take big bite of Apple\n\nThe last time a weekly sell-to-buy ratio was worse than this was in late July 2011, right before that year\u2019s debt-ceiling debate began to spiral out of control. Over the next couple of weeks, of course, as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s credit rating was downgraded, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% lost some 2,000 points.\n\nTo be sure, insiders have been selling heavily for several weeks now, and the market has continued to rise \u2014 including the Dow\u2019s eclipsing of the 14,000 level in recent sessions. This surprising strength in the face of insider selling has prompted a number of you to inquire how unusual it is for the insiders collectively to be such poor market timers.\n\nAs you can imagine, it\u2019s not unprecedented. But it is more the exception than the rule.\n\nConsider where the sell-to-buy ratio was in mid-December, which is the last time I devoted a column to the insiders\u2019 behavior. For NYSE-listed stocks, the ratio at that time stood at 8.38-to-1. Read Dec. 18 Mark Hulbert column on insider selling.\n\nUpon reviewing the historical data, shared with me by Argus Research, I found four occasions over the last decade in which the ratio got this high or higher and the market continued rising for at least another month or two.\n\nOverall, however, the market fell. On average over the month following each prior occasion when the sell-to-buy ratio got this high, the broad market fell by 2.1% \u2014 as measured by the Wilshire 5000 total-return index.\n\nIn any case, as others among you have pointed out, the high level of insider selling in December could very well have been caused in large part by the prospect of higher tax rates in 2013 \u2014 which would have prompted them to accelerate their sales. To the extent this was so, of course, the high sell-to-buy ratio at that time would have been a false signal.\n\nRegardless, the sell-to-buy ratio today is even higher than it was in mid-December, and it can\u2019t be discounted because of the immediate prospect of higher taxes.\n\nAll of which suggests to me that there is a distinct possibility that this time around, unlike in December, the insiders will be right.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/wPEX3LaXAsc/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-05T12:01:27", "title": "How to pick dividend-paying stocks", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 So you\u2019ve finally decided to heed the oft-repeated advice to invest in dividend-paying stocks.\n\nNow what?\n\nIt turns out that you still have an overwhelmingly large number of stocks to choose among. In 2012, for example, more than 400 of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.58% paid dividends \u2014 or more than 80% of them.\n\nTelling me to confine myself to just the dividend-payers, therefore, doesn\u2019t narrow my buy list down to a helpful number.\n\nThe best way of going about constructing a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks, based on the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s monitoring of more than 500 separate strategies, is to follow the methodology employed by Investment Quality Trends.\n\nWhy Dow may hit 15,000 in 2013\n\nThis service, inaugurated by Geraldine Weiss more than four decades ago and currently edited by Kelley Wright, doesn\u2019t simply recommend the dividend stocks with the highest yield. The service instead focuses more narrowly on the bluest of the blue-chip dividend-paying stocks, and recommends one of them only when its yield is near the high end of its historical range.\n\nThe service\u2019s restriction to just the bluest of blue-chip companies is designed to avoid companies at which the dividend yield is only temporarily high \u2014 firms that are about to cut their dividends, in other words.\n\nSpecifically, Wright puts a stock on his watch list only if it satisfies at least five of the following six criteria:\n\nHas increased its dividend at least 5 times over the last dozen years\n\nHas an S&P Quality Ranking in the \u201cA\u201d category\n\nHas at least 5 million shares outstanding\n\nHas at least 80 institutional investors\n\nHas paid dividends for at least 25 straight years\n\nHas produced higher earnings per share in at least 7 of the last 12 years\n\nThe service\u2019s focus on relative dividend yield is a recognition that each company has a different baseline. A utility company, for example, may still pay a much higher dividend yield than other companies, even when that yield is lower than its baseline \u2014 and when, therefore, it more likely than not is overvalued.\n\nHow has this approach performed? Over the last 12 months, for example, it has outperformed all of the major dividend-oriented ETFs. The average portfolio from Investment Quality Trends has gained 16.9% over this period, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest.\n\nBetter yet, this superior return was produced with nearly 20% less volatility, or risk \u2014 which means its performance on a risk-adjusted basis is even better than the raw numbers already suggest.\n\nIts record over the longer term has also been impressive. Over the 25 years the Hulbert Financial Digest has tracked it, it has beaten a buy-and-hold by one percentage point per year on an annualized basis, while nevertheless incurring 14% less risk.\n\nInvestment Quality Trends currently is in third place for risk-adjusted performance over the last 25 years.\n\nWhich high-quality stocks are currently recommended by this approach? The following is Wright\u2019s \u201cTimely Ten\u201d list of his top 10 current recommendations:\n\nThis package of 10 stocks not only has an average dividend yield of 2.6% but, Wright is convinced, has good capital-appreciation potential in the event of a continuation of the bull market, and healthy downside protection in the event of a bear market.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/stWPJLBZcDU/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-01T12:01:39", "title": "The 5 biggest investor mistakes of 2013", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 Facebook Inc.\u2019s revenue is growing at a fast pace. But it isn\u2019t growing fast enough to support the social network\u2019s current stock price.\n\nFacebook FB, -0.40% released its latest quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday \u2014 reporting quarterly revenue of $1.59 billion. That brought revenue for all of last year to $5.1 billion. See: Facebook\u2019s results beat estimates\n\nThat\u2019s a big number, for sure, and certainly seems impressive.\n\nTo understand why I nevertheless believe that it\u2019s not good enough, it\u2019s helpful to review a back-of-the-envelope calculation of Facebook\u2019s valuation that I introduced in a column immediately after the company went public last May at $38 per share. Follow full coverage of Facebook\u2019s quarterly results and conference call.\n\nDoes Facebook have its mojo back?\n\nThat calculation required just three inputs:\n\nFacebook\u2019s revenue growth rate over its first five years as a publicly traded company. I assumed that it would be the same as the average of all U.S. IPOs between 1996 and 2005 \u2014 212% cumulatively, or 25.6% on an annualized basis (after excluding spinoffs and buyouts).\n\nFacebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in five years\u2019 time. I assumed it would be the same as Google\u2019s is today GOOG, +0.07% \u2014 which is a quite generous assumption, since Google\u2019s price-to-sales ratio is nearly four times larger than the overall market\u2019s.\n\n\u2014 which is a quite generous assumption, since Google\u2019s price-to-sales ratio is nearly four times larger than the overall market\u2019s. The rate of return Facebook investors would require to hold the stock for the five years after its IPO. Generously, I assumed the market\u2019s long-term average return of 11%. If I had assumed a higher return number, then the outcome of my analysis would have been an even lower fair value today.\n\nArmed with these three otherwise generous inputs, calculating a fair price for Facebook was a matter of simple math: As I reported last May, that price was $13.80. Read previous column: Facebook\u2019s stock should trade for $13.80.\n\nHow can Facebook overcome this awful fate? Since investors won\u2019t be happy earning less than 11% per year, and since it\u2019s unreasonable to expect the company\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2017 to be markedly higher than Google\u2019s is today, the only realistic way for Facebook to overcome my dismal price target is for its revenue growth rate to be far higher than 25.6% per year through 2016.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Getty Images\n\nYet the company has not shown that it can maintain this much higher revenue growth rate.\n\nTo be sure, it might on the surface seem otherwise. The company\u2019s revenues for calendar 2012 were 37% higher than in 2011.\n\nBut, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who is one of academia\u2019s leading experts on IPOs, the typical pattern is for a post-IPO company\u2019s revenue growth rate to decline over its first several years after going public.\n\nTo average 25.6% over its first five years after coming to market, therefore, a company\u2019s revenue growth in its first couple of years needs to be above that rate.\n\nConsider, for instance, the average revenue growth rate over the first three years after a company comes to market. According to Ritter, this three-year growth rate was 36.7% per year for the same sample of IPOs that produced a five-year annualized growth rate of 25.6%.\n\nSo Facebook\u2019s revenue growth over this past year is almost precisely in line with the rate that was the basis of my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nHow, then, is Wall Street able to persuade itself that Facebook should be trading at its currently high price? As far as I can tell, by assuming Facebook deserves to have a sky-high price-to-sales ratio \u2014 not just now, but also well into the future.\n\nConsider, according to FactSet, the consensus estimate of Facebook\u2019s revenues in calendar 2015 \u2014 the furthest year out for which a consensus estimate is provided. That consensus is $10.5 billion\u2014not that far off of what was implied by my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nAssuming that consensus is on target, and assuming Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2015 will be the same as Google\u2019s is today, then Facebook\u2019s market cap at the end of 2015 would be around $52 billion. That\u2019s some 25% lower than where the company\u2019s market cap stands today.\n\nDon\u2019t like the conclusions of my calculations? Be my guest and go through the exercise yourself, employing any of the standard valuation metrics. And use your calculations to subject Facebook\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report to a smell test.\n\nMy hunch is that if you do so, you will not be running out to buy Facebook stock afterward.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/WztdRhRt8IM/story.asp", "published": "2013-01-25T16:27:45", "title": "Apple\u2019s drop shows price of popularity", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 What investment lesson are you drawing from Apple\u2019s breathtaking plunge over the last couple of months?\n\nThe one I think is most important is a contrarian one: To find your prince, you need to be willing to kiss a frog.\n\nFor years now, this contrarian lesson was dismissed by Apple AAPL, +0.79% investors, who racked up huge gains by ignoring contrarian analysis and instead investing in the most popular, coolest and best-performing company in sight. (Read blog post on the more than 5,000 mutual funds and ETFs that own Apple shares.)\n\nHowever, now that the stock is down nearly 40% since its peak of last September \u2014 including a more than 12% drop in Thursday\u2019s trading alone \u2014 perhaps they will be more open to considering the contrarian wisdom of investing in out-of-favor companies.\n\nThe stocks of such companies may be less exciting, but over the long term they usually provide a superior \u2014 and certainly less volatile \u2014 return.\n\nJust consider a spectacular bet that Robert Arnott, chairman and founder of Research Affiliates, made in the summer of 2010. To set the context of his bet, Apple that summer surpassed Microsoft MSFT, +3.00% to take the No. 2 spot in the market-cap rankings \u2014 and was fast closing in on ExxonMobil XOM, -3.28% as the largest publicly traded company in the world.\n\nAs contrarian investors know, sometimes you need to kiss a frog to find your prince. Reuters\n\nBP BP, -4.33% , in contrast, was on life support as it struggled to cope with the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Its stock price had plunged to its lowest in over a decade. Survival was by no means assured.\n\nLike the good contrarian he is, however, Arnott was willing to \u201ckiss the frog\u201d: He publicly bet that BP would outperform Apple over the longer term.\n\nThat was a gutsy bet indeed. If you don\u2019t believe me, take a look at the vitriolic comments my column received for merely reporting Arnott\u2019s bet. Read August 2010 column in Barron\u2019s by Mark Hulbert: Is Apple\u2019s market value too big for comfort?\n\nTo be sure, Arnott\u2019s bet only recently became a winner. But he is today enjoying the last laugh: Since BP\u2019s low in the summer of 2010, it has produced a cumulative real return of 77%, in contrast to 71% for Apple.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only time Arnott has kissed a frog. Another came a year after his BP-over-AAPL bet: In August 2011 he predicted that Bank of America BAC, -3.47% would outperform Apple over the long term.\n\nAt that time, it was hard to imagine Bank of America\u2019s reputation being more awful. It represented all that was dysfunctuional about bank and mortgage-company behavior that led to the credit crunch and liquidity crisis of 2008.\n\nEven today it is paying the price for its bad deeds: Its latest quarterly earnings, released last week, were hugely depressed by billions in charges related to the settlement of various legal disputes arising out of the subprime-mortgage fiasco. Read full report on BAC earnings.\n\nIs Apple a value investor's dream?\n\nYet on this BAC-over AAPL bet, Arnott is even further in the black than he is with his BP bet: Since my August 2011 column reporting it, Bank of America stock has produced an 18-month real return of 60%, versus 25% for Apple.\n\nTo be sure, contrarian bets like Arnott\u2019s don\u2019t always work out this nicely. But, more often than not, they do.\n\nWe know this because of the superior long-term performance of benchmarks like Arnott\u2019s so-called fundamental indices, which almost always end up underweighting the stocks with the largest market caps.\n\nConsider the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index, which weights stocks according to a number of fundamental criteria rather than market cap. In the summer of 2010, for example, when Arnott made his BP-over-AAPL bet, Apple was the 27th largest company in that index. It would have been the second-largest company in the index if its weight had been based on market cap.\n\nSince the inception of the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index in November 2005, its alternate weighting scheme has added 1.44 percentage points per year to its return. That\u2019s a lot of alpha to trace to changing each stock\u2019s weight in the index.\n\nKeep that in mind the next time you\u2019re tempted to invest in the latest fad on Wall Street.\n\nWhat frog might a contrarian be kissing right now?\n\nIn an email earlier this week, Chris Brightman, head of investment management at Research Affiliates, suggested betting on Wal-Mart WMT, +2.77% over Amazon AMZN, +4.35% . The latter company may not have the same pizzazz that Apple did in its heyday, but it still represents the allure and promise of the high-tech sector \u2014 especially in contrast to Wal-Mart.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock is up over 50% over the last year, triple Wal-Mart\u2019s stock gain of just 17%.\n\nBrightman\u2019s contrarian-based reasoning: \u201cToday, Amazon has a market capitalization of $124 billion, more than half of Wal-Mart\u2019s $233 billion market cap. Yet Wal-Mart is more than five times the size of Amazon measured by sales, cash flow, dividends, and book value. Wal-Mart has free cash flow ... of $11 billion per year to distribute to its shareholders \u2014 which is paid as $5 billion in dividends and $6 billion as share buybacks \u2014 providing a nearly 5% annual yield.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon [in contrast] has only $2 billion of free cash flow and pays nothing back to its shareholders. Amazon\u2019s sales and cash flow will need to more than quintuple relative to Wal-Mart to match Wal-Mart\u2019s ability to pay its shareholders. Anything less, and Wal-Mart is the better investment.\u201d\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}]}, "marketwatch_stories": {"rss": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/topstories/", "link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/newsviewer/", "articles": [{"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B62BE9634-7FEE-11EA-ACD4-37694A66548C%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-04-16T21:48:30", "title": "\u2018This is going to hurt\u2019 \u2014 pain is on the way for the four big U.S. banks", "text": "The four largest U.S. banks posted profits in the first quarter, even though they set aside billions of dollars for expected loan losses.

Morgan CFO Jennifer Piepszak addressed the \u201cbase case\u201d by saying that after initially factoring in an annualized 25% GDP decline and 10% unemployment for the second quarter, the bank\u2019s economists had \u201cupdated their outlook and now have GDP down 40% in the second quarter and unemployment at 20%,\u201d according to a transcript provided by FactSet.\n\nThose figures are by no means unreasonable. This week\u2019s initial jobless claims report brought the total to more than 20 million, creating a 15% unemployment rate estimate.\n\nThat said, there are many moving parts. Later in the call, after Kotowski asked whether federal and regulatory relief efforts for borrowers might \u201cpush back the charge-off curve,\u201d Piepszak responded: \u201cIt may, because as long as a customer is performing under the forbearance program, they are not delinquent. But,of course, it will all depend on whether these programs ultimately are able to bridge people back to employment.\u201d\n\nClean credit in the first quarter\n\nHere's a summary of how the provisions for loan losses lowered first-quarter earnings for the largest four U.S. banks, with all numbers in millions:\n\nBank Ticker Provision for loan losses - Q1, 2020 Provision for loan losses - Q4, 2019 Provisions for loan losses - Q1, 2019 J.P.

WFC, -5.45% $653 $2,873 $5,860 Source: company filings\n\nYou can click on the tickers for more about each company, including news coverage.\n\nYou will have to scroll the tables to see all the data.\n\nNote: The net income figures are before preferred-stock dividends.\n\nHere are some common credit measures, showing that the banks were certainly looking ahead while setting aside so much for loan loss reserves, backing Kotowski\u2019s \u201cnoise\u201d comments.\n\nThe first is nonaccrual loans to total loans. A loan is placed in nonaccrual status if the lender is no longer confident that principal and interest will be repaid. The loan can stay in this status for some time before it is charged-off as a loss. Consumer loans will be carried in \u201cperforming\u201d but delinquent categories of past due 30-89 days and past due 90-plus days before being placed in nonaccrual. A commercial loan may be categorized quickly as nonaccrual if it cannot be renewed or if there is some other credit event making its repayment doubtful.\n\nBank Nonaccrual loans/total loans - March 31, 2020 Nonaccrual loans/total loans - Dec. 31, 2019 Nonaccrual loans/total loans - March 31, 2019 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. 0.59% 0.43% 0.55% Bank of America Corp 0.39% 0.36% 0.52% Citigroup Inc. 0.58% 0.57% 0.54% Wells Fargo & Co. 0.61% 0.56% 0.73% Source: company filings\n\nSo there was only an uptick in nonaccruals, sequentially.\n\nNext is net charge-offs to average loans. Net charge-offs are loan losses minus recoveries. After charging-off a loan, a bank may recover some of the loss by repossessing and disposing of collateral. You can see that net charge-offs remained low during the first quarter:\n\nBank Net charge-offs/average loans - Q1, 2020 Net charge-offs/average loans - Q4, 2019 Net charge-offs/average loans - Q1, 2019 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. 0.62% 0.63% 0.58% Bank of America Corp 0.46% 0.39% 0.43% Citigroup Inc. 0.30% 0.28% 0.29% Wells Fargo & Co. 0.38% 0.32% 0.30% Source: company filings\n\nMost of the big four banks saw a small increase in net charge-offs but these are low figures, especially when compared with the banks\u2019 rising reserve coverage:\n\nBank Loan loss reserves/total loans - March 31, 2020 Loan loss reserves/total loans - Dec. 31, 2019 Loan loss reserves/total loans - March 31, 2019 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. 2.32% 1.39% 1.43% Bank of America Corp 1.51% 0.97% 1.02% Citigroup Inc. 2.91% 1.84% 1.82% Wells Fargo & Co. 1.19% 1.09% 1.14% Source: company filings\n\nThis last chart is interesting, because it shows that Citigroup C, -5.46% has set aside more reserves than the others, reflecting greater international and credit-card exposure. JPM\u2019s high reserve set-aside reflects the dreadful economic scenario in the \u201cbase case,\u201d as described above by Piepszak.\n\nWells Fargo WFC, -5.45% has the lowest level of reserves, which reflects in part the restrictions against balance-sheet expansion the bank has been operating under since early 2018, in the wake of several customer-service problems and investigations in its retail, loan servicing and wealth management divisions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve eased some of the restrictions in April, to allow the bank to increase its lending to small businesses, but Doctoroff believes it is time for the regulators to unleash Wells Fargo completely.\n\n\u201cThey obviously want to increase lending. If you want to win a war, you have to be all-in,\" he said.\n\n\u201cBanks can be good actors in this,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are all trying to be. It is about helping our clients, putting the government money out there. I hope it continues.\u201d\n\nShanahan of Edward Jones said banks\u2019 mortgage loan forbearance efforts, which are backed by the CARES Act, are a good thing, \u201cespecially if you think the magnitude and timing for the economic recovery is favorable.\u201d\n\nBut he worries that for some borrowers who will be unable to get their jobs back, \"you are kicking the can.\u201d The banks are \u201cextending relief\u201d to most types of borrowers, he added, while saying \u201cthey are likely to mitigate losses over time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not worried about the banks going under \u2014 I am not worried about a 2008 scenario,\u201d Doctoroff said. \u201cBut if this lasts more than a year, or year and a half, you are going to see some problems in [banking] too.\u201d", "author": ["Philip Van Doorn"]}, {"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B98E08868-801A-11EA-BA29-BD3B7DF19976%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-04-16T21:42:36", "title": "Trump to announce guidelines to \u2018open up\u2019 U.S. economy, ease coronavirus restrictions", "text": "The White House unveiled new guidelines for states and localities on lifting coronavirus-related restrictions on citizens and businesses, as President Trump looks to bring the nation\u2019s focus toward reigniting an economy battered by efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe protocols, titled \u201cOpening Up America Again,\u201d do not suggest a time frame for when states should lift restrictions, as the president had suggested they might earlier this week. Instead, the White House proposed a list of six metrics states should \u201csatisfy before preceding to a phased opening,\u201d according to a copy of the guidelines published by the Washington Post. They include:\n\nA decline in influenza-like illnesses reported within a 14-day period and a downward trajectory of covid-like cases reported within a 14-day period;\n\nA decline in documented cases of COVID-19 within a two-week period or a decline in the share of coronavirus tests that come back positive, if test volume increases or remains flat; and\n\nHospitals within a jurisdiction should be able to treat all patients without \u201ccrisis care\u201d and there should be a \u201crobust testing program in place for at-risk health care workers\u201d including tests for COVID-19 immunity.\n\nThe president is expected to introduce the plan during a news conference scheduled for 6 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nIf states meet these criteria, the guidelines suggest a three-phased approach to reopening the economy. The first stage would involve reopening of some businesses, including gyms, restaurants, movie theaters and places of worship \u201cif they adhere to strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols.\u201d The guidelines suggest schools should remain closed, while employers should continue to encourage telework when possible and that nonessential travel be minimized.\n\nIf states and regions show no evidence of a rebound in coronavirus cases, they will be advised to move to phase two, during which schools and youth activities can resume and large venues can operate under \u201cmoderate physical distancing protocols.\u201d Elective surgeries could also resume under phase two.\n\nDuring both phases one and two, the guidelines suggest the elderly and individuals with serious underlying health conditions should continue to shelter-in-place.\n\nUnder phase three, restrictions would be greatly relaxed, with visits to senior care facilities and hospitals allowed to resume, while restaurants, bars, movie theaters, sporting venues and places of worship could operate under \u201climited physical distancing protocols.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines are a departure from the posture the president took earlier in the week, when the president suggested a May 1 date for when many states could lift restrictions. He also claimed to have \u201cabsolute authority\u201d in determining when restrictions would be eased, despite it being largely governors who instituted coronavirus restrictions. The president has little constitutional power to force state governments to change laws and regulations regarding public health, constitutional experts say.\n\nDespite these federal guidelines, some states have already committed to keeping current restrictions in place, including New York, which will maintain its shutdown order through May 15, at least, while California published its own guidelines for when it will begin to ease restrictions Tuesday. Meanwhile states in the Northeast, Midwest and West Coast have entered into regional pacts that will involve close interstate coordination on coronavirus policy going forward.", "author": ["Chris Matthews"]}, {"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B4D7836F8-7DB0-11EA-B298-E6606EABF547%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-04-16T21:39:44", "title": "Professional gamblers in Nevada may now be able to collect unemployment", "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has caused unprecedented layoffs in the U.S., leading to a record number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits.

People who gamble for a living normally would not be able to collect unemployment, but the statewide shutdown of casinos due to the coronavirus may change that.\n\nNevada Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered the shutdown of all casinos until April 30, and possibly longer, so gamblers will not be able to visit to their \u201cworksites\u201d for at least three more weeks.\n\nRosa Mendez, a spokeswoman for the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, told the Las Vegas Review Journal that gamblers are self-employed and may qualify as independent contractors \u201cduring this unprecedented time and under the CARES Act.\u201d\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed by President Trump on March 27. One aspect of the bill extended unemployment benefits to self-employed individuals.\n\nGambling may not be viewed as a typical job, but a lot of Americans in the state of Nevada make a living gambling, and pay taxes on that income.

At the time, he noted that the state would re-evaluate the measure after a two-week period.\n\nThe order was extended amid continuing evidence that the measures are helping control the spread of the virus. Hospitalizations are down, ICU admissions are down and intubations are down across the state, according to the governor.\n\nA total of 606 people died across the state on Wednesday, the lowest level in 10 days.\n\nThe state\u2019s single-day death count peaked last week as 799 New Yorkers died on April 8. As recently as Tuesday, the measure stood at 752.\n\nThe extended shutdown order comes as the state grapples with the growing economic impact of closures.\n\nHours before Cuomo announced the extension, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio revealed the proposed budget for the fiscal year 2021. The $83.9 billion plan is $6.3 billion below the $95.3 billion budget the mayor proposed in January and includes \u201cover $2 billion in very tough budget cuts,\u201d de Blasio said.\n\nAlso see: NYC mayor pledges $170 million to feed the city\u2019s hungry\n\nThe city is also predicting a loss of $7.4 billion in tax revenue over the current fiscal year and next.\n\n\u201cThe executive budget I\u2019m presenting today was built for this moment in history and a moment unlike any other,\u201d the mayor said.

So, where we can cut, we will. But when it comes to protecting New Yorkers, we will not cut that.\u201d\n\nSome of the proposed budget cuts include:\n\nClosure of outdoor pools this summer: $12 million\n\nCancellation of 2020 Summer Youth Employment Program: $124 million\n\nSlowing the expansion of 3-K: $43.8 million\n\nDelayed installation of air conditioners in every city school: $9.9 million\n\nFunding reduction for Vision Zero public awareness campaign, protected bike lanes, and markings and other materials: $10 million\n\nSuspension of curbside compost pickup: $21 million\n\nThe mayor again called upon the federal government to assist the city. \u201cThey have the ability to provide the resources in a way that no one else, no organization, nothing else on earth can help us the way the federal government can, and now it\u2019s their hour of decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been $2.2 trillion in stimulus funding so far\u2014$2.2 trillion\u2014of which only $1.4 billion has been indirect aid to New York City,\u201d he said. \u201cThe airline industry got $58 billion, so corporate bailouts, huge.

His death was sudden and tragic, and while the exact cause is unknown, it made me realize something all business owners should be thinking about now: This is not the time to be prioritizing business over health.\n\nIf you run a business, you need to acknowledge that your health and the health of your staff must come first during this coronavirus crisis, regardless of your circumstances. Otherwise, you risk putting lives at stake, and, despite what some politicians say, no amount of money, growth, valuation, or GDP is worth a human life.\n\nRemember your humanity\n\nClose to 17 million people have filed for unemployment in the past three weeks alone. A third of Americans are unable to pay their rent. Countless others are now without health insurance. This financial instability places a huge amount of stress on individuals, stress that we know severely impacts physical, mental, and emotional health. While new reports of coronavirus cases and deaths dominate the news cycle, we\u2019re seeing another, even more brutal public health crisis emerge that will take even longer to contain.\n\nAs a business owner, I know how easy it is to lose focus in a crisis. In the past decade, I\u2019ve come close to losing my business twice, and in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, our revenue is down more than 50%. Friends, colleagues, and mentors have recommended layoffs as our best course of action, arguing that if our business goes under all my employees will be out of a job. It\u2019s a common argument, but one I find problematic for several reasons.\n\nFirst, your employees are not expenses. They are human beings whose lives have inherent value. By choosing to lay them off to save your business, you\u2019re essentially saying that your business is more important than their livelihood. When you pause for even a second to think about this, you realize it\u2019s not true. We\u2019ve just become so conditioned to justify inhumane practices for the sake of business.\n\nSecond, deprioritizing the well-being of your people upholds an inherently unfair system. We live in a world that undervalues the majority of society for the benefit of very few people. At some point, if you want to change the system, you have to behave differently. I personally would rather see my business fail knowing I did everything I could to protect my team than succumb to greed and fear at their expense.\n\nCommunicate that you care\n\nThere are several ways to communicate your priorities to your people:\n\n. Tell them: If you haven\u2019t already done so, reach out to all of your employees right now and tell them that your No. 1 priority is their health and well-being. Let them know that your definition of health is the broadest one possible and includes mental and emotional as well as physical well-being. Demonstrate your commitment by checking in with them, asking how they\u2019re doing, and giving them the time and resources they need to take care of themselves. . Give them time off: If you don\u2019t already have a comprehensive paid sick leave policy, work with your HR team to develop one now. Tell your employees that they can and should take as much time as they need to tend to their health and the health of loved ones without having to worry about whether they will be paid. At my company, we have an open, paid-time-off policy, so employees can work directly with their managers to take as much time as they need. . Clarify benefits: Make sure your employees know all of the benefits they\u2019re entitled to under your insurance or other policies. What testing does your insurance plan cover? What\u2019s covered if they end up in the hospital? People are often so stressed about the financial costs associated with healthcare that they may delay treatment or inadvertently worsen their condition by stressing their bodies. Simply providing them information and resources can help assuage some of those fears. . Look beyond physical health: What mental health benefits does your insurance plan cover? Can employees access teletherapy services, either through insurance or another program? If your insurance doesn\u2019t cover mental health, consider signing up for a paid program like Modern Health (which our company uses) that offers access to counselors and other tools. . Demonstrate by doing: Employees often hesitate to take time off if they think they\u2019ll be penalized for it. Make sure you and your managers are walking the walk by not working when sick and taking time to do things away from work. I\u2019ve been working eighteen-hour days for several weeks, but last week I posted a video on social media of me taking a day off to ski. We are all human. We all need to take time to do things we love and recharge. Show that this is a priority for you through your actions.\n\nI know times are difficult right now, and having to worry about other people on top of everything else can feel impossible. But, trust me, when you look back on this, you will feel better prioritizing humanity over profit and you will have done your part to make our society a little more human, too.\n\nRead: Fed should pay every American more, let hedge funds and billionaires \u2018get wiped out,\u2019 says Social Capital CEO\n\nMore: This company pays its workers a $70,000 minimum salary, and that\u2019s helping it weather the coronavirus crisis\n\nDan Price is CEO of Seattle-based Gravity Payments.

A report on U.S. industrial production fell 5.4% in March, the steepest decline since early 1946, and retail sales in March registered a record 8.7% slump; meanwhile, a reading of confidence among U.S. home builders in April fell to its lowest reading since 2012 and the largest monthly change in the index\u2019s 30-year history.\n\nLast week, Trump said he would \u201clove\u201d to open the country at the start of May.\n\nHowever, business leaders have urged that the president increase testing for the illness derived from the novel strain of coronavirus before revving the economy back up, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nExperts also believe that reopening the economy without proper testing \u2014 absent a vaccine or effective therapies \u2014 could result in a resurgence of the disease.\n\nStock benchmarks ended Wednesday lower, but have rebounded mightily since putting in their most recent bear-market low on March 23. From that point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% is up 23.88%, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.58% has gained about 22%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.65% has returned 21.68%, supported by U.S. monetary and fiscal stimulus.\n\nLancz, who forged a relationship with Templeton until the investment guru\u2019s death in 2008, is a firm believer in the contrarian investing, finding value when others see battered assets.\n\nBack in 2007, he advised clients to sell before the market soured, and in 1987, he sidestepped the crash, a period in which the Dow saw a 22% drop in a single session.\n\nThis time, the investor advocates that investors adopt caution for a crisis that is unlike any he has seen in his career.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this crisis has all three parts of the past bear markets\u2019 sell-offs,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis pandemic not only threatens America\u2019s standard of living but also could position us as a secondary global power.\u201d", "author": ["Mark Decambre"]}, {"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B759731D8-4551-459D-8EAD-C36500A68D3B%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-04-16T21:00:07", "title": "\u2018This is going to hurt\u2019 \u2014 pain is on the way for the four big U.S. banks", "text": "Earnings held up during the first quarter \u2014 it may not last as loan losses mount.

Michigan, with just above 1 million initial jobless claims during the period, saw the second highest number per capita. Pennsylvania had 1.3 million unemployment insurance claims overall, the fourth-most per 10,000 residents. Generally, states that supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 saw more jobless claims than those that backed Trump. Michigan and Pennsylvania, which helped to send Trump to the White House by voting for him by razor thin margins, stand out from the bunch. \u2014Jacob Pramuk, John Schoen\n\n4:21 pm: Gov. Newsom offers two weeks of paid sick leave to California food workers\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a statewide executive order giving two weeks of supplemental paid sick leave for those working in the food sector.\n\n\n\n\"That sector by definition is essential to our livelihood and our capacity to meet just basic needs in this pandemic,\" Newsom said at a press briefing Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe paid sick leave will be available to to workers who have contracted Covid-19, been exposed to it or have been affected by isolation or quarantine orders from local, state or federal health officials.\n\n\n\n\"We don't want you going to work if you're sick,\" Newsom said.\n\n\n\nThe measure impacts frontline food workers such as those who grow, pick, pack, deliver, cook and sell food, according to Newsom. He said he hopes the paid sick leave will \"significantly address\" some of the anxiety these workers have during the pandemic \u2014Hannah Miller\n\n4:10 pm: New Jersey opens probe of nursing home deaths after finding 17 bodies in facility\n\nNew Jersey has opened an investigation into nursing home deaths across the state after officials discovered 17 bodies piled into a makeshift morgue and more than 100 residents infected with Covid-19 at a long-term care facility, state officials said Thursday. Gov. Phil Murphy said he was \"outraged\" that staff at the Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center in Northern New Jersey piled deceased residents into a small room at the facility. \"A story like this shakes you to the bone,\" Gov. Phil Murphy said at a press conference. \"New Jerseans living in our long-term care facilities deserve to be cared for with respect, compassion and dignity. We can and must do better.\" State and local officials inspected the facility at about 2 a.m. on Sunday after receiving a call that it needed body bags and was storing 28 dead bodies, New Jersey Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli told reporters. There were just five bodies on the premises; three more were released to local mortuaries earlier, she said. They received another complaint on Tuesday, she said. Officials have since discovered that 103 residents have tested positive for the coronavirus and 133 more have flu-like symptoms between the facility's two buildings, she said. At least 35 residents have died since March 30; 19 of those have been attributed to Covid-19, she said. At least 52 employees have reported flu-like symptoms. \u2014Noah Higgins-Dunn, William Feuer, Dawn Kopecki\n\n4:00 pm: For essential retail workers, the need for mental health care may outlast pandemic\n\nFor grocery store and pharmacy workers across the U.S., stocking shelves and checking out customers have become anxiety-inducing tasks. Each commute and customer interaction comes with the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. And returning home means a chance of transmitting a potentially deadly illness to a spouse or family member. Thousands of grocery and retail workers have gotten sick from Covid-19. Some have died. Major retailers, psychologists and the nation's top grocery worker union say they anticipate a greater need for mental health services, such as therapy, as people continue to work during the pandemic and later cope with its aftermath. Anxiety, depression and other mental health challenges may linger, even as coronavirus cases level out or decline \u2014 especially for those on the front lines. Some retailers, such as Walgreens and Walmart, say they're encouraging workers to use company-provided benefits, such as tele-therapy and referring them to digital tools that offer stress relief strategies, mediation exercises and peer support. \u2014Melissa Repko\n\n3:47 pm: 'A long way to go' before there's enough testing to reopen economy, Business Roundtable CEO says\n\nThe United States needs to see increased testing for the coronavirus before businesses can begin to reopen, Business Roundtable President and CEO Joshua Bolten said Thursday. \"We've clearly got a long way to go, but there's progress being made every day ... all the CEOs in our organization agree that testing is an absolutely crucial gating element to getting us back and running safely,\" Bolten said on CNBC's \"Power Lunch.\" \"So everything we can do to expand the availability of fast and accurate testing is going to be probably the most crucial element to reopening promptly and safely.\" The lack of testing for the virus has been one of the main issues facing the U.S. during the pandemic, with many places limiting who could be tested as the virus spread across the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said tests it sent out early on were found to be defective. Bolten said returning to a more normal economic environment should involve a \"phased\" plan in which some businesses open before others and that policymakers should be working on those arrangements now. \"It's not too soon to plan for a safe and rapid reopening. In fact, it's very important that the planning go on now,\" Bolten said. \u2014Jesse Pound\n\n3:22 pm: The economy can't reopen without widespread testing \u2014 getting there will take a lot of work and money\n\nAs the United States reels from the massive economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, there are growing calls by President Donald Trump and others to start to reopen businesses, schools and other public spaces so that the nation can begin to recover financially. But health experts and several top business leaders warn that the country should not reopen on a broad scale unless there is a huge increase in the relatively small number of tests currently being done for Covid-19 infection. Health experts also say the country needs a related and equally robust program to trace the people who have had contact with infected people, to avoid seeing those contacts themselves spread the coronavirus to others. There are only about 120,000 samples or so being tested each day for the coronavirus in the United States, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts say that millions of people will have to be tested each day, even as many as 20 million to 30 million people, before the nation can return to a semblance of economic normality. \u2014Dan Mangan\n\n3:04 pm: NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo on how the state will prioritize the reopening of businesses\n\n2:51 pm: GE, Ford sign $336 million federal contract to make ventilators\n\nGeneral Electric and Ford Motor will produce 50,000 ventilators for the U.S. government under the Defense Production Act for $336 million, federal officials announced. Production of the ventilators is expected to begin next week at a Ford facility in Michigan. The companies are expected to produce all the ventilators by July 13, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. According to the terms in the announcement, each ventilator would cost $6,720. That's nearly $10,000 below a previous federal contract for 30,000 ventilators at $489.4 million, or about $16,300 per unit, with General Motors and Washington-based Ventec Life Systems. \u2014Michael Wayland\n\n2:37 pm: Starz app sees 142% spike in new subscribers\n\nBrad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio star in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" Sony\n\nPremium TV subscription Starz has seen a spike in viewership and new sign-ups in the wake of social distancing restrictions in the U.S., Starz CEO Jeff Hirsch said on CNBC's \"The Exchange.\" The premium cable channel, which also has a digital app, is home to critically acclaimed shows like \"Outlander\" as well as hot films like \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" The Starz app has seen a 44% jump in average viewership since people have been forced to stay home due to the outbreak. The app, which usually costs $9 a month, is currently discounted to $5 a month for three months. It has seen a 142% increase in new customers since the stay-at-home orders began. \u2014Sarah Whitten\n\n2:20 pm: Apple Store to reopen in South Korea with an emphasis on fixing Macs and iPhones\n\nAn Apple store in Seoul will reopen on Saturday, an Apple representative confirmed. It's the first Apple retail store outside of China to reopen and Apple's only store in South Korea. The store will have limited hours and will focus on fixing existing customers' iPhones and computers. \"To start, we'll have an adjusted schedule and guidelines to ensure customers and employees continue to stay healthy. A focus for the store will be service and support at the Genius Bar. For customers who want to make a purchase, we have several options including ordering online for delivery or pick up in store,\" Apple said in a statement. \u2014Kif Leswing\n\n2:18 pm: Seven governors in Midwest to work together to reopen their economies\n\nGovernors in seven U.S. Midwest states said they will work in close coordination to reopen the economy in their regions.

The company will instead host gatherings of that size as virtual events. \u2014Salvador Rodriguez\n\n1:55 pm: Cramer: Amazon is the 'Grim Reaper' for smaller businesses, but it also may help save America\n\n1:49 pm: Italy's fashion leaders urge Rome to lift restrictions on industry\n\nItaly's fashion leaders called on the government to loosen restrictions imposed in response to the coronavirus crisis to allow them to resume some production, warning that a prolonged lockdown risked irreparably damaging the sector. \"Fashion is a seasonal industry, and certain dates are not compressible. Not reopening shortly would mean giving up almost a year's turnover,\" said Carlo Capasa, the chairman of Italy's National Fashion Chamber (CNMI), in an online interview on the website of daily Corriere della Sera. Current lockdown measures in Italy - the country with the third highest number of confirmed cases after the United States and Spain - have been imposed until May 3. With a turnover of 95 billion euros ($98 billion US) and 600,000 workers, Italy's fashion and textile industry is the second most important nationwide. It accounts for a 41% share of the sector in Europe, followed by Germany, which represents 11% of the total. \u2014Reuters\n\n1:41 pm: The New York retail real estate market is reeling because of coronavirus, as rents tumble\n\nA woman wearing face mask walks by a closed store at Times Square on April 12, 2020 in New York City. Liao Pan | China News Service | Getty Images\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is pummeling the retail real estate market in New York City, with rents tumbling and not expected to turn around anytime soon, according to a new report from commercial real estate services firm CBRE. Average retail asking rents in the city continued to fall during the first quarter, which started Jan. 1 and ended March 31, with the average of the New York City neighborhoods surveyed dropping 9% year over year to $714 per square foot, the report said. This marked the tenth consecutive quarter of declines. On a year-over-year basis, 13 of the 16 corridors tracked by CBRE, including the Upper East Side and Upper West Side, saw rent decreases. Most notably, in Times Square, retail rents have dropped to levels not seen since 2011. Average rents dropped 15.7% from a year ago to $1,647 per square foot. Average rents are now below $1,800 per square foot for the first time since 2011, CBRE said. \u2014Lauren Thomas\n\n1:33 pm: US intel community examining whether virus emerged accidentally from a Chinese lab\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community is examining whether the virus that caused a global pandemic emerged accidentally from a Chinese research lab studying diseases in bats, current and former U.S. intelligence officials tell NBC News. Spy agencies have ruled out that the novel coronavirus was manmade, the officials say. But scientists at a military and a civilian lab in Wuhan, where the virus originated, are known to have conducted ongoing research on coronaviruses, officials say. They say intelligence agencies have gathered and are weighing evidence that an employee of one of the labs could have become accidentally infected and left the facility with the virus. \"It's a possibility, though not the most likely possibility,\" one official told NBC News. Asked about the intelligence on TODAY, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said, \"This is something we've been watching closely now for some time,\" adding that the results of the investigation are thus far \"inconclusive.\" \u2014Ken Dilanian, Courtney Kube\n\n1:25 pm: Lawyers get ready for first-ever Supreme Court oral arguments by phone\n\nThe Supreme Court's announcement this week that it will hold oral arguments via teleconference for the first time in its history has a small group of America's top attorneys prepping for the most important phone calls of their careers. The court said that it will hear 10 arguments over the first two weeks in May, including blockbuster disputes over the Electoral College and whether President Donald Trump can keep his tax records shielded from investigators. The issues are weighty, whether they are discussed in a basement office over a cell phone or inside the Supreme Court's historical Corinthian building. But lawyers who will be arguing before the court are still adjusting. \"I'm trying to figure out: Do you stand up? Do you sit down? Do you get a podium?\" Jay Sekulow, an attorney for the president and a veteran Supreme Court lawyer, said in a recent interview. Those questions are just the beginning. Do you use earbuds? Put the justices on speaker phone? And what about the handcrafted quill pens, which in more normal times are left on the counsel table as a souvenir for arguing attorneys? \"I am planning on giving my quill pens to my grandchildren, so I am hoping they still send us the quill pen,\" said Sekulow, who will be asking the top court to reverse lower court rulings ordering Trump's banks and longtime accounting firm to hand over his financial records to state and congressional investigators. \u2014Tucker Higgins\n\n1:19 pm: 2020 New Orleans Jazz Fest canceled\n\nThe 2020 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, which had been rescheduled for the fall, has been canceled, organizers announced.

Several shelters have made adjustments to continue offering the same services while minimizing contact. That means spreading out beds, sterilizing surfaces more frequently and offering services at a distance. It's been tricky for shelters around the country to adjust to new social distancing guidelines. But many have found solutions in which they're still responding to people who need a place to stay while adhering to any government-issued advice or rules. \u2014Yelena Dzhanova\n\n12:26 pm: New York and other East Coast states extend shutdown of nonessential businesses to May 15, Gov. Cuomo says\n\nNew York and other East Coast states are extending their shutdown of nonessential businesses to May 15 as officials grapple with how to reopen parts of the economy without leading to a resurgence in coronavirus cases, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Cuomo announced the news at a press conference in Albany and via Twitter, saying \"New York on PAUSE\" will be extended in coordination with other states. \"We have to continue doing what we're doing. I'd like to see that infection rate get down even more. The New York Pause policies, the close-down policies, will be extended in coordination with other states to May 15,\" Cuomo said. The lockdown was previously scheduled to lift on April 30. \"So, one month, we'll continue the close-down policies. What happens after then? I don't know. We will see what the data shows,\" Cuomo said. \"I don't want to project beyond that period.\" \u2014Noah Higgins-Dunn\n\n12:12 pm: UK extends coronavirus lockdown measures by at least three weeks\n\nBritain is extending its coronavirus lockdown measures by at least another three weeks, Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said. Restrictions on public life have been in place in the U.K. since March 23. People have been told to stay at home, with the exception of limited shopping \u2014 for essential food and medical supplies \u2014 and exercise. Government ministers previously said it was too early to lift the restrictions, as the U.K. had not yet hit the peak of its coronavirus outbreak. But Britain's chief medical advisor, Chris Whitty, said on Wednesday that he believed the country was \"probably reaching the peak.\" \u2014Ryan Browne\n\n12:05 pm: Abbott Labs is developing new coronavirus test for mass screening as Trump seeks to reopen US economy\n\nAbbott Laboratories says it is ramping up production of its coronavirus test kits, including a new tool that could enable mass Covid-19 screening, as President Donald Trump seeks to reopen parts of the U.S. economy as early as next month. The company is on track to ship 4 million this month of its new antibody tests, which indicate whether a person has had Covid-19 in the past and was either asymptomatic or recovered, Abbott CEO Robert Ford said during an earnings conference call with investors Thursday. It plans to ramp up to 20 million shipments per month, beginning in June, he said, adding there's a need to manufacture more tests. \u2014Berkeley Lovelace Jr.\n\n11:55 am: Switzerland to start easing COVID-19 restrictions from April 27\n\nPeople walk past a red-and-white police warning tape in Plainpalais place in Geneva on April 16, 2020, during the lockdown due to the novel coronavirus, Covid-19.

Hospitals will be allowed to perform all procedures, even elective surgeries, while hair salons, massage parlours and cosmetic studies will be allowed to reopen. This will be followed by compulsory schools, shops and markets from May 11, it added. \u2014Reuters\n\n11:40 am: Japan makes coronavirus emergency nationwide as Abe plans cash payouts for all\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expanded a state of emergency to include the entire country on Thursday and said the government was considering cash payouts for all in an effort to stem the coronavirus outbreak and cushion the economic downturn. With more than 9,000 infections and nearly 200 deaths nationally, the government has declared an emergency in Tokyo and six areas including western Osaka, but other regions have sought to be added amid worries about the spreading virus. While short of a lockdown, the state of emergency imposed for a month from April 7 gave authorities more power to push people to stay home and businesses to close. It has covered about 44% of the population up until now. \u2014Reuters\n\n11:21 am: What it's like to be a delivery person during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nAs the coronavirus has upended all of our lives and routines, we've become reliant upon certain essential workers to help us stay as safe and healthy as possible.

The Small Business Administration website reads that it is \"unable to accept new applications for the Paycheck Protection Program based on available appropriations funding. Similarly, we are unable to enroll new PPP lenders at this time.\" The announcement from the SBA on Thursday comes as scores of small American business owners work to deal with the fallout of the coronavirus and the move by some states to shutter the vast majority of commerce. \u2014Thomas Franck, Kate Rogers\n\n11:03 am: NYC mayor seeks federal aid as coronavirus costs New York $7.4 billion in lost tax revenue\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic will cost New York City a projected $7.4 billion in lost tax revenue over the current and next fiscal year after the city shuttered businesses and ordered people to stay indoors to try to contain the outbreak, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday. De Blasio urged Washington lawmakers to approve $500 billion in spending in the next stimulus bill with at least $150 billion of that going toward states, cities and local municipalities. That would help plug holes in budgets devastated by the government quarantines and help fund needed services, including police, fire and emergency response. De Blasio said Congress should direct $100 billion to hospitals and health-care workers and $250 billion to small businesses and paycheck protection for workers, de Blasio said. \u2014Noah Higgins-Dunn\n\n10:50 am: PGA Tour plans to resume play June 8 with events closed to general public\n\nPGA TOUR flag during the first round of the Korn Ferry Tour's The Bahamas Great Exuma Classic at Sandals Emerald Bay golf course on January 12, 2020 in Great Exuma, Bahamas.

The feature will roll out in the coming weeks, Facebook said in a blog post. \"These messages will connect people to COVID-19 myths debunked by the World Health Organization including ones we've removed from our platform for leading to imminent physical harm,\" Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of integrity, said in a blog post. After the WHO declared Covid-19 a global health emergency in January, Facebook started removing misinformation about the outbreak from its platforms. The company said Thursday it's removed hundreds of thousands of pieces of misinformation that could lead to physical harm, such as inaccurate content that says physical distancing is ineffective or drinking bleach cures the virus. \u2014Jessica Bursztynsky\n\n9:49 am: The coronavirus pandemic isn't hurting US auto sales as much as feared, J.D. Power says\n\nSales of new vehicles to U.S. consumers declined less than expected at the beginning April despite the coronavirus outbreak and state orders keeping most dealer showrooms closed across the country, according to J.D. Power. After U.S. auto plants closed and most states enacted \"stay-at-home\" directives last month, J.D. Power expected year-over-year sales to decline by as much as 80% this month compared with its prepandemic forecast. While still significantly down, sales through the first 12 days of April were only off by about 55% \u2014 indicating that sales for the full month might not be as bad as feared, the firm said Wednesday. If that trend continues, it would mean sales of about 597,000 units in April compared with J.D. Power's prepandemic forecast of nearly 1.1 million vehicles for the month. \u2014Michael Wayland\n\n9:35 am: Stocks open slightly higher even after another dismal weekly jobs report\n\nStocks opened higher even as investors digested more data reflecting the economic devastation from the coronavirus pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 44 points higher, or 0.2%. The S&P 500 climbed 0.7% while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.1%. Thursday's moves followed a slump during regular trading on Wednesday as gloomy economic data and anemic bank earnings fueled concerns over the coronavirus's impact on the U.S. economy. \u2014Fred Imbert, Thomas Franck\n\n9:18 am: The US economy will likely erase all the job gains since the financial crisis this week\n\nThe coronavirus and the forced closure of business throughout the U.S. have nearly wiped out the totality of job gains since the Great Recession. The Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of Americans applying for state unemployment benefits totaled 5.245 million during the week ended April 11. Combined with the government's prior three jobless claims reports, the number of Americans who have filed for unemployment over the previous four weeks is 22.025 million. That number is just below the 22.442 million jobs added to nonfarm payrolls since November 2009, when the U.S. economy first began to add jobs back to the economy after the recession. \u2014Thomas Franck\n\n9:11 am: Billionaire Barry Diller says bail out everyone and 'worry about paying the bills later'\n\nHeidi Gutman | CNBC\n\nBillionaire businessman Barry Diller told CNBC on Thursday the U.S. government should bail out all companies that have been hit hard by the coronavirus, including those in the travel industry. \"The damage that is being done every day is enormous,\" Diller said on \"Squawk Box.\" \"Everybody needs to be bailed out for this one time thing, and we'll worry about paying the bills later.\" The comments from Diller, chairman of travel site Expedia and digital media group IAC, came after major U.S. airlines and the Treasury Department reached a deal that gives the carriers access to loans and grants to support payroll. In return, the government gets warrants that could become equity stakes. Diller said Expedia is generating no revenue and will need to cut costs, including in advertising. \u2014Jesse Pound\n\n9:06 am: Starbucks is preparing to reopen cafes as local coronavirus conditions allow\n\nStarbucks is preparing to reopen cafes as some U.S. states report that the number of new coronavirus cases has plateaued or even declined. The coffee chain closed most of its U.S. and Canadian cafes on March 21, limiting service to delivery and drive-thru only. More than 60% of its U.S. cafes have a drive-thru lane. Starbucks initially said the closures would be for two weeks but later extended the measures until May 3. \u2014Amelia Lucas\n\n9:04 am: US home construction collapsed 22.3% in March\n\nU.S. homebuilding activity collapsed in March as the coronavirus spread, with housing starts tumbling 22.3% from a month ago. The Commerce Department said Thursday that groundbreakings occurred last month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.2 million units, down from a 1.56 million pace in February. Construction of single-family houses fell 17.5%, while apartment and condo starts were off 32.1% from a month ago. The report showed a 6.1% decline in the completion of homes being constructed, which means many homes are being left half built. There was also a 6.8% drop in permits to begin construction. \u2014Associated Press\n\n8:56 am: Coronavirus crisis threatens to derail post-Brexit trade talks\n\nThe U.K. will most likely fail to strike a new trade agreement with the European Union by the end of the year, analysts have told CNBC, as the coronavirus crisis threatens to derail official trade talks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to conclude a post-Brexit trade deal this year. The U.K. is in a transition phase until December after leaving the bloc on Jan. 31. During the transition, it is working to establish trade arrangements with the 27-nation EU. However, this timeline is now at risk after the two lead negotiators had to isolate due to Covid-19 infections. British and European negotiating teams held a call on Wednesday for the first time since both lead negotiators were forced to self-isolate. \u2014Silvia Amaro\n\n8:50 am: 'It may be in August' \u2014 Larry Fink says businesses reluctant to reboot without mass testing\n\nBlackRock co-founder and CEO Larry Fink said the U.S. needs to increase its testing capacity for the coronavirus before its economy can restart in earnest. \"We're going to still see elements of the disease increasing in other parts of the world and until we have adequate testing, rapid testing, it's very hard to see how we're going to reboot in the next 30 days,\" Fink said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" Fink expressed confidence that the U.S. will make progress on Covid-19 treatments, minimizing the severity of the disease. \"Through that process, I do believe we'll be able to reboot. I do believe we're going to have a better, more normalized environment,\" he said. \"But it may not be in June or July. It may be in August,\" he said. Fink, whose firm is the world's biggest asset manager, said businesses will be \"very cautious\" and \"protective of their employees\" as they consider when and how to relax work-from-home policies. \u2014Kevin Stankiewicz\n\n8:34 am: US weekly claims total 5.245 million, bringing total job losses due to coronavirus to 22 million\n\nProtection measures against the coronavirus continued to tear through the employment ranks, with 5.245 million more Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment insurance last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The new filings bring the crisis total to just over 22 million, nearly wiping out all the job gains since the Great Recession. Though the most recent total, for the week ended April 11, represented a drop from the previous two weeks, it still showed that the damage to the U.S. labor market remains profound. The numbers of late have been bolstered by measures taken to allow more workers to file claims. They now include independent contractors and others who previously were not eligible for benefits. \u2014Jeff Cox\n\n8:08 am: Jeff Bezos says widespread testing needed before economy can get running again\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos said Thursday that mass testing around the world for the coronavirus is needed to \"get the economy back up and running.\" In his annual shareholder letter, Bezos also pointed to efforts Amazon has taken to protect its employees from the pandemic.

The U.K.'s top medical expert said Wednesday that the country is probably seeing its peak of the virus (the death toll currently stands at 12,868 in British hospitals, with 761 daily deaths reported Wednesday), but it is too early to consider lifting lockdown measures that have been in place since March 23. \u2014 Holly Ellyatt\n\n6:35 am: Spain's daily death toll rises slightly\n\nThe number of daily deaths in Spain has risen slightly, according to health ministry data.

K. C. Wilsey | FEMA | via Reuters\n\nAs the United States reels from the massive economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, there are growing calls by President Donald Trump and others to start to reopen businesses, schools and other public spaces so that the nation can begin to recover financially. On Thursday, Trump tweeted he would be holding a \"Major News Conference\" that evening to \"explain Guidelines for OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN!\" But health experts and several top business leaders warn that the country \u2014 which might not see a coronavirus vaccine for 18 months or more \u2014 should not reopen on a broad scale unless there is a huge increase in the relatively small number of tests currently being done for Covid-19 infection. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in a note to shareholders early Thursday, wrote: \"Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running.\" \"For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available,\" Bezos noted. NBC News later reported that Democratic lawmakers in calls Thursday with Trump insisted that he wait until there is widespread testing available before he pushes to reopen the nation. But Trump indicated to them that such an economic reopening would have to occur before an expansion of testing levels, Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., told NBC News. Health experts also say the country needs a related and equally robust program to trace the people who have had contact with infected people, to avoid seeing those contacts themselves spread the coronavirus to others. There are only about 120,000 samples or so being tested each day for the coronavirus in the United States, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts say that millions of people will have to be tested each day, even as many as 20 million to 30 million people, before the nation can return to a semblance of economic normality. That is much more than the number of tests even projected to be produced by some major manufacturers by June.\n\n\"To avoid a second wave of viral spread you have to do what South Korea and other countries, including Germany, have done. You have to have testing in place, and aggressive testing,\" said Dr. Tom Moore, an infectious disease specialist in Wichita, Kansas. \"We don't have to test everybody, but we definitely need to test a significant portion of the community,\" said Moore, a former board member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. \"This is a Herculean task,\" he said. \"I don't know how it's going to be solved in the immediate future, but it needs to be.\" Moore and other experts say that a second or third wave of Covid-19 infections could end up killing more people than the first wave, lead to another series of shutdowns of businesses, and ultimately end up doing greater economic damage than has been seen to date from the pandemic.\n\nAs of Thursday, there were more than 639,000 cases of coronavirus reported in the U.S., with nearly 31,000 people dead from the disease.\n\nMillions of tests a day\n\nOfficials at the Rockefeller Foundation told CNBC they expect to release in coming days a paper outlining the scope of the work that needs to be done to get the U.S. on track to safely returning to work, school and leisure time activities. The philanthropic group is a major donor for efforts related to health, science and other areas. The foundation said that it has been in contact with the Trump administration, national groups of governors and mayors, and leading American corporations as it prepares its recommendations. \"It's going to [initially] cost at least $100 billion and upward of $500 billion over the long haul,\" said Eileen O'Connor, senior vice president for communications, policy and advocacy at the Rockefeller Foundation. The foundation's plan, which will propose that the cost be financed directly and subsidized by the federal government, estimates that 20 million to 30 million tests each day would need to be performed to get many Americans back to a more normal life. But the foundation also estimates that there will ultimately need to be 200 million to 300 million tests each week to have the economy functioning as it was before the outbreak began. That level of testing assumes multiple rescreenings of individual Americans in the absence of a Covid-19 vaccine. The Rockefeller Foundation's plan calls for changes in logistics to optimize the current capacity of testing in the U.S., which by June or July could allow for 2 million to 3 million tests per week, O'Connor said. At the same time, O'Connor said, \"We need to invest in the different kinds of tests that can be ramped up even more quickly and as efficiently\" as possible. She said a medium-term goal is to ramp up the testing capacity with a \"huge investment\" that could lead to \"up to 10 million tests per week, before we can get certain sectors back to work.\" Even that number of polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests would be a tiny fraction of the U.S. population of 330 million or so.\n\nThe first sector to target with a testing capacity of 10 million or so tests per week would be health-care workers, many of whom have contact with coronavirus patients, police and emergency workers, O'Connor said. Then food production workers, including farm workers, and then trucking workers. That target could be reached by this fall, the foundation believes. After that, the goal would be to have tens of millions of tests done every day to have the country fully return to work.\n\nMore tracking\n\nThe Rockefeller Foundation's plan also will call for \"data aggregation\" platforms that will track where tests and testing-related supplies such as swabs and chemical reagents are located and where they should be allocated. \"We then have to also marry that with testing results and contact tracing ... so that we can know where the disease is going next,\" O'Connor said. The contact tracing could be aided by digital apps and geolocators to identify where infected people have been, she said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday said the state, which is currently ground zero for the Covid-19 pandemic in the U.S., will need an \"army\" of contact tracers to identify people who have been with infected individuals. He called on the federal government to fund that effort. Thomas Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the news site STAT this week that \"We need an army of 300,000 people\" to do contact tracing nationwide. O'Connor said, \"There is no doubt we need to get the economy back and running, and if we don't the damage will be long lasting.\" \"Everybody is focused on the safest return to work possible, but the only way you do that is testing,\" she added.\n\nA long road ahead\n\nThe Rockefeller Foundation's plan does not estimate that the U.S. workforce will be back to normal anytime soon. And while the foundation's projections for the number of needed tests might seem high to some people, it comes on the heels of projections published by the Edmond Jr. Safra Center for Ethics last week. \"These [projections] suggest that, depending on what tracing technology is used in conjunction with testing, at least millions and possibly hundreds of millions of tests per day will be needed,\" that analysis said. \"While we estimate that such capacity is possible by late spring or early summer,\" the authors wrote, \"we must invest much more aggressively if we are to allow a return to work.\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration, and a CNBC contributor, has called for a plan that would test anyone who visits a doctor, which would be nearly 4 million people per week. But Gottlieb also said in a Vox interview this week that getting to the point where the United States has the capacity to perform 2 million to 3 million tests each week \"is going to be very hard.\" He said it would be possible to reach that level by September but added that Congress would need to support that effort. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said Thursday, \"I say we should not send you back to work till it's safe to send you back.\" Choosing between the economy and health \"is a false choice,\" he said. \"The way you revive the economy is you defeat the disease,\" said Biden, who argued that widespread testing will be needed to determine who can return to work and which workplaces and public spaces can be opened again. BlackRock CEO and co-founder Larry Fink said during an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday: \"We're going to still see elements of the disease increasing in other parts of the world and until we have adequate testing, rapid testing, it's very hard to see how we're going to reboot in the next 30 days.\" Fink said he expects that treatments for Covid-19 could be improved to speed up that economic rebooting, \"But it may not be in June or July. It may be in August.\" He noted that a number of business leaders told Trump during conference calls on Wednesday that \"we need to have adequate\" testing \"to make sure we have a secured environment.\" Trump himself this week said, \"Our country has to get open, and it will get open, and it will get open safely and hopefully quickly. Some areas quicker than other areas.\" The president, who is running for reelection this fall, also claimed \"there's tremendous testing, and the governors will use whatever testing is necessary, and if they're not satisfied with their testing, they shouldn't open.\" But Trump's own leading infectious disease advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told the Associated Press in an interview Tuesday that the U.S. is \"not there yet\" in having enough testing capability or contact tracing systems in place to rely on for reopening the economy.\n\nEquipment shortage\n\nComplicating the effort to increase the number of tests performed in the U.S. is a shortage in equipment needed to conduct those screenings. This week, the American Academy of Medical Colleges wrote Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House's Coronavirus Task Force, and said the group appreciated the fact that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had taken steps \"to reduce regulatory barriers to developing, validating, and deploying\" coronavirus tests. But the group added that while those tests hold the promise for increased numbers of Covid-19 screenings, \"we have come to learn over the past several weeks, despite the best efforts of all parties, not one of these components [needed to run those tests] is readily available in sufficient quantities to each and every lab that needs them.\" \"Widespread but uneven shortages in one or more of the essential components for testing have resulted in a situation where few labs are able to maximize the testing capacity of any one machine, platform, or test,\" the letter said. Qiagen, a major manufacturer of the RNA extraction kits used to detect the coronavirus for tests, told CNBC on Thursday that it \"produced enough kits in March to purify RNA for coronavirus testing of about 3.3 million patient samples, up from about 1 million in February and an average of 400,000 a month during 2019.\" The company added that it \"aims to double production to about 7 million in April and ramp up to about 20 million a month by October 2020 \u2014 well ahead of our original plan that we announced on March 17.\" That level of production would still, for Qiagen at least, be far short of the levels of testing the Rockefeller Foundation plans to call for.\n\n'The test has to be affordable'", "author": ["Dan Mangan"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/15/what-it-is-like-to-deliver-for-instacart-and-amazon-during-coronavirus.html", "published": "2020-04-16T15:20:36", "title": "What it's like to be a delivery person during the coronavirus pandemic", "text": "As the coronavirus has upended all of our lives and routines, we've become reliant upon certain essential workers to help us stay as safe and healthy as possible.

The entire world has been waiting for results from Gilead's clinical trials, and positive results would likely lead to fast approvals by the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies. If safe and effective, it could become the first approved treatment against the disease.\n\nMore from Stat News:\n\nThe University of Chicago Medicine recruited 125 people with Covid-19 into Gilead's two Phase 3 clinical trials. Of those people, 113 had severe disease. All the patients have been treated with daily infusions of remdesivir.\n\n\"The best news is that most of our patients have already been discharged, which is great. We've only had two patients perish,\" said Kathleen Mullane, the University of Chicago infectious disease specialist overseeing the remdesivir studies for the hospital.\n\nHer comments were made this week during a video discussion about the trial results with other University of Chicago faculty members. The discussion was recorded and STAT obtained a copy of the video.\n\nThe outcomes offer only a snapshot of remdesivir's effectiveness. The same trials are being run concurrently at other institutions, and it's impossible to determine the full study results with any certainty. Still, no other clinical data from the Gilead studies have been released to date, and excitement is high. Last month, President Donald Trump touted the potential for remdesivir \u2014 as he has for many still-unproven treatments \u2014 and said it \"seems to have a very good result.\"\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Gilead said: \"What we can say at this stage is that we look forward to data from ongoing studies becoming available.\"\n\nGilead had said to expect results for its trial involving severe cases in April. Mullane said during her presentation that data for the first 400 patients in the study would be \"locked\" by Gilead Thursday, meaning that results could come any day.\n\nMullane, while encouraged by the University of Chicago data, made clear her own hesitancy about drawing too many conclusions.\n\n\"It's always hard,\" she said, because the severe trial doesn't include a placebo group for comparison. \"But certainly when we start [the] drug, we see fever curves falling,\" she said. \"Fever is now not a requirement for people to go on trial, we do see when patients do come in with high fevers, they do [reduce] quite quickly. We have seen people come off ventilators a day after starting therapy. So, in that realm, overall our patients have done very well.\"\n\nShe added: \"Most of our patients are severe and most of them are leaving at six days, so that tells us duration of therapy doesn't have to be 10 days. We have very few that went out to 10 days, maybe three,\" she said.\n\nReached by STAT, Mullane confirmed the authenticity of the footage but declined to comment further.\n\nAsked about the data, Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, described them as \"encouraging.\"\n\n\"The severely hit patients are at such high-risk of fatality. So if it's true that many of the 113 patients were in this category and were discharged, it's another positive signal that the drug has efficacy,\" he said, adding that it will be important to see more data from randomized controlled studies.\n\nGilead's severe Covid-19 study includes 2,400 participants from 152 different clinical trial sites all over the world. Its moderate Covid-19 study includes 1,600 patients in 169 different centers, also all over the world.\n\nThe trial is investigating five- and 10-day treatment courses of remdesivir. The primary goal is a statistical comparison of patient improvement between the two treatment arms. Improvement is measured using a seven-point numerical scale that encompasses death (at worst) and discharge from hospital (best outcome), with various degrees of supplemental oxygen and intubation in between.\n\nThe lack of a control arm in the study could make interpreting the results more challenging.\n\nA lack of data has led to yo-yoing expectations for the drug. Two studies in China had enrollment suspended partway through because there were not enough patients available. A recent report of patients given the drug under a special program to make it available to those who are very ill generated both excitement and skepticism.\n\nIn scientific terms, all the data are anecdotal until the full trial reads out, meaning that they should not be used to draw final conclusions. But some of the anecdotes are dramatic.\n\nSlawomir Michalak, a 57-year-old factory worker from a suburb west of Chicago, was among the participants in the Chicago study. One of his daughters started feeling ill in late March and was later diagnosed with mild Covid-19. Michalak, by contrast, came down with a high fever and reported shortness of breath and severe pain in his back.\n\n\"It felt like someone was punching me in the lungs,\" he told STAT.\n\nAt his wife's urging, Michalak went to the University of Chicago Medicine hospital on Friday, April 3. His fever had spiked to 104 and he was struggling to breath. At the hospital, he was given supplemental oxygen. He also agreed to participate in Gilead's severe Covid-19 clinical trial.\n\nHis first infusion of remdesivir was on Saturday, April 4. \"My fever dropped almost immediately and I started to feel better,\" he said.\n\nBy his second dose on Sunday, Michalak said he was being weaned off oxygen.

Twitter was the first to move, strongly encouraging its nearly 5,000 employees to work from home on March 1, because of the rapidly spreading coronavirus, and making the order mandatory on March 11. Amazon told its roughly 50,000 Seattle-area employees on March 4 to work from home if they could. Facebook informed its Bay Area workers the next day that it was \"strongly recommending\" they work remotely. Over the next week, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce mostly emptied out, keeping about 200,000 people away from the office. Tech has taken a beating in recent years as critics have attacked the industry's growing power, privacy abuses and executive malfeasance. But the industry's early social-distancing moves are a big reason that California and Washington, two early U.S. hotspots of virus outbreak, have bent the infection curve while other states are deep in crisis. \"lt comes down to a real sense of civic responsibility,\" said Amy Weaver, Salesforce's president of legal and corporate affairs and general counsel. \"If we've got the ability to work from home and save lives we've got to be doing that.\" In California, Covid-19 has killed two people for every 100,000 residents, and in Washington the number is eight, according to data collected by the New York Times. Both states are seeing a slowdown in the number of new cases. New York, meanwhile is at almost 60 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people, New Jersey is over 35 and Louisiana and Connecticut have reached 24.\n\nEarly government moves on the West Coast helped, such as banning large gatherings and closing schools. But tech companies led the way in getting people to stay home. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer of security software vendor McAfee, says the industry was able to respond because it's been spearheading the move to a world of cloud computing and collaboration, enabling people to work from anywhere and on a multitude of devices. By contrast, banks in New York, auto companies in Detroit, and big retailers, energy producers and food producers in other regions don't have the same luxury. The same is true for Amazon's hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers. \"The Bay Area is largely a digital economy and digital workplace,\" said Grobman, who's based in Plano, Texas, but supports about 400 of the company's employees in and around Silicon Valley. \"Workers were largely familiar with remote working technology and businesses were well-suited to run many aspects of their business remotely.\"\n\nSalesforce saw what Trump missed\n\nFor Salesforce, the problem started to become clear in late January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said Weaver, who attended along with about a dozen other company executives, including CEO Marc Benioff. Panels were beginning late, she said, because leaders from various parts of the world were taking calls about the coronavirus, which at the time was centered in China. President Trump said not to worry. In response to a question on Jan. 22, about the coronavirus, Trump told CNBC in Davos that, \"We have it totally under control\" and \"it's going to be just fine.\"\n\nWeaver was seeing something different. \"I got the sense something was going on even though it wasn't in the headlines at that point,\" Weaver said. By Feb. 10, Salesforce had a steering committee meeting daily, and nine days later the company canceled a big event scheduled for March in Sydney and made it virtual-only. Then came an end to non-essential travel and handshakes. Finally, on March 7, employees were asked to work from home. Of Salesforce's 50,000 employees, more than 7,000 are in San Francisco. It also has a large presence in Seattle after the company's acquisition of Tableau Software last year. Hundreds of miles to the north of Salesforce's headquarters, Challenge Seattle, an alliance of 19 CEOs from the city's top employers, convened a dinner on Feb. 25, to discuss how to take unified action. It was four days before Washington state officials confirmed the first U.S. death from coronavirus, a man in his 50s in the Seattle area. Former Washington Governor Christine Gregoire, CEO of Challenge Seattle, said the group snapped into action right away, putting health experts out front in regular briefings to describe the severity of the coronavirus, which blew up in Seattle with an outbreak at a senior center. Executives from Microsoft and Starbucks also detailed what they experienced at their operations in China. On March 4, Microsoft encouraged employees in the Seattle region and Bay Area to work from home. \"When the larger employers did so, the medium-sized to small businesses began to follow suit,\" Gregoire said. \"No-one here doesn't think that has contributed significantly to why our curve really flattened faster than anybody anticipated.\" Gregoire calls the collaboration between corporate executives and government leaders the \"most heartwarming thing I've ever seen\" in terms of public-private partnership. For example, when the National Guard said it was having trouble getting and distributing personal protective equipment (PPE), Challenge Seattle put out a call and got experts from Microsoft and Amazon to run the process for the state, she said. Gregoire said Challenge Seattle is still leading daily calls with experts, and on Wednesday 200 people joined.\n\nRichard 'Rich' Barton, co-founder and CEO of Zillow Inc. Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nReal estate marketplace Zillow is one of the group's members. In late February, the company put together a taskforce to meet daily and prepare its facilities, human resources, communications, operations and finance teams for what was coming. The company asked all employees to cancel non-essential travel on March 1, and Zillow CEO Rich Barton opted not to attend Morgan Stanley's technology conference in San Francisco the next day, dialing in instead. A couple days later, on March 4, it recommended that 2,500 employees in Seattle and 400-plus in San Francisco work from home. \"We feel that we certainly took action as quickly as possible,\" said Dawn Lyon, Zillow's chief corporate relations officer, adding that it took longer for the company to shut down other parts of the business in markets where conditions were different. In Seattle and the Bay Area, \"talking to government and city officials and working in collaboration with other businesses was super helpful,\" she said. Lyon said Zillow learned of its first known Covid-19 infection two weeks ago and that there haven't been many within the company. Joseph Ansanelli is still in the early stages of building his San Francisco-based company Gladly, which sells customer service software. He sent his 100 employees home the first week in March. Ansanelli, who was previously a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners, suggested tech executives were quick to act partly because the industry appreciates scientific data and understands the concept of viral growth. Businesses like Facebook, LinkedIn and Airbnb (all Greylock companies) took off because one person who liked the service would tell three people who would each tell three more. Tech investors compare the phenomenon to an infectious virus for a reason. \"We understood theories of virality, not from a medical standpoint but from a growth standpoint,\" Ansanelli said. \"We said this may be in the early stages, but this thing grows geometrically, and in a week it's going to be really bad.\"\n\nTrying to reboot\n\nSaving lives, however, is very different than saving the economy. Tech start-ups in Northern California and the Seattle area are getting battered with layoffs, particularly for companies tied to travel, tourism and mobility. A website, Layoffs.fyi, was created to track job cuts at start-ups. Since March 11, the site says, 253 companies have eliminated over 24,600 positions, and many more are expected. Even Google is slowing hiring for the rest of the year. But because of the effective shelter-in-place efforts, the West Coast is now mapping out a plan for restarting the economy. On Monday, Newsom, Inslee and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown announced a regional partnership to coordinate their efforts, and on Tuesday, Newsom outlined six indicators that will guide California's decision. They include the ability to protect residents through testing, the health system's ability to handle a possible surge, the development of therapeutics and the ability for businesses and schools to implement physical distancing. As government leaders start planning to reopen, tech companies that switched quickly into remote mode can take their time returning to the office, and can even become more flexible as they look to the future. Outreach, which sells software for salespeople, started sending its 450 employees home on March 2, the morning after CEO Manny Medina returned from a trip to the U.K. \"We made it not a hard stop, but you have to have a damn good reason for coming to the office,\" said Medina.\n\nOutreach CEO Manny Medina Outreach", "author": ["Ari Levy"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/15/stocks-that-may-surprise-street-during-an-ugly-earnings-season.html", "published": "2020-04-16T00:20:37", "title": "Looking for upside during an ugly earnings season?

U.S. housing starts plunged 22.3% in March.\n\nNew York extends shutdown\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday the state, in coordination with other states, will keep nonessential businesses shut down until May 15. The extension comes even as the hospitalization rate in New York has fallen. It also comes after President Donald Trump again advocated for a gradual reopening of the economy during a press conference Wednesday evening. \"There has to be a balance. You know, there's also death involved in keeping [the economy] closed,\" Trump said from the White House. \"We have to get back to work.\" On Thursday, Trump told governors they should feel free to re-open their states before May 1, depending on their conditions, according to The New York Times. Thursday's moves followed a slump during regular trading on Wednesday as gloomy economic data and anemic bank earnings fueled concerns over the coronavirus's impact on the U.S. economy. The Dow and Nasdaq both fell more than 1% on Wednesday while the S&P 500 lost 2.2% on the back of disappointing retail sales data. Despite the recent dismal economic data, some market strategists pointed to a slowdown in the daily number of new U.S. coronavirus cases and the flattening in the net number of hospitalizations in New York state as evidence that markets may trend upward in the coming weeks.", "author": ["Fred Imbert Thomas Franck", "Fred Imbert", "Thomas Franck"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/feds-harker-says-lost-jobs-will-come-back-but-us-should-be-patient.html", "published": "2020-04-16T20:17:23", "title": "Fed's Harker says lost jobs will come back, but US should be patient", "text": "Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker expressed optimism Thursday that many of the 22 million jobs lost so far during the coronavirus lockdown will come back, though he said the nation shouldn't rush.\n\nInstead, he counseled a slow return to normalcy, with parts of the economy that can practice social distancing to reopen first and others to come back online as medical advances make it possible.\n\n\"We're going to hit a period where it's going to be pretty bad.

Mike Segar | Reuters\n\nFor grocery store and pharmacy workers across the U.S., stocking shelves and checking out customers have become anxiety-inducing tasks. Each commute and customer interaction comes with the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. And returning home means a chance of transmitting a potentially deadly illness to a spouse or family member. Thousands of grocery and retail workers have gotten sick from Covid-19. Some have died. Major retailers, psychologists and the nation's top grocery worker union say they anticipate a greater need for mental health services, such as therapy, as people continue to work during the pandemic and later cope with its aftermath. Anxiety, depression and other mental health challenges may linger, even as coronavirus cases level out or decline \u2014 especially for those on the front lines. Some retailers, such as Walgreens and Walmart, say they're encouraging workers to use company-provided benefits, such as teletherapy and referring them to digital tools that offer stress relief strategies, mediation exercises and peer support. In some hard-hit parts of the country, government officials are urging the public to seek out mental health services, too. In New York, for example, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said thousands of mental health professionals have volunteered to provide free and confidential support through a new hotline and residents can use Headspace, a meditation and mindfulness app. New Jersey has launched a similar hotline. \"We cannot overlook the mental health impacts this pandemic is having on all of us,\" said New Jersey's health commissioner Judy Persichilli, at a news conference Thursday. She said some Americans are out of work, far from those they love and anxious as they risk exposure during essential work \u2014 which creates new worries. \"While we fight hard to protect your physical health, let's be sure to focus just as intently on our mental health and mental well-being,\" she said.\n\n'Asked to do this extraordinary thing'\n\nVaile Wright, director of clinical research and quality for the American Psychological Association, said hourly retail jobs typically come with stresses like low wages, long hours on your feet and numerous customer interactions. \"Working these jobs is stressful under normal circumstances,\" she said. \"Then, you add the current situation, which is they are knowingly putting themselves at risk of exposure and have been deemed an essential worker, but I imagine don't feel like they're being paid as an essential worker. So you have this almost disconnect, too, where you're being asked to do this extraordinary thing.\" Wright said she hopes the pandemic inspires more employers to expand access to therapy by phone or video, which she said is \"just as effective as face to face.\" She said the approach eliminates some of the barriers such as availability in rural areas, concerns about anonymity or problems getting child care or transportation to go to a session. \"Employers have a lot of power,\" Wright said. \"They're negotiating huge, huge packages with these insurers and that's something they need to advocate for.\" On a phone call Monday, grocery workers from across the country who belong to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union shared their worries of catching the coronavirus or bringing it home to their families. The workers said those fears have been exacerbated by customers who don't wear masks, especially as they see their friends and co-workers get sick. As of Monday, 30 people who belong to the union, which represents 1.3 million workers at grocery chains, meatpacking plants and more, have died from Covid-19. About 3,000 have been directly affected by the virus, such as through infection, hospitalization or quarantine because of symptoms. That doesn't include deaths of employees at nonunion companies, such as Walmart and Amazon-owned Whole Foods. Two Walmart workers at a store in the Chicago area died, and the family of one of them has filed a wrongful death lawsuit. Walmart said in a statement that it's \"heartbroken\" by the employees' deaths and \"mourning along with their families.\" The retailer said it's added numerous safety measures, such as providing masks to employees and taking their temperatures. Some grocery workers are already struggling, said Marc Perrone, president of the UFCW. He's spoken to employees who can't sleep. Others said they feel stressed or burned out. Perrone said he's waking up in the middle of the night and having pandemic-related dreams, even without working at a store each day. He said that the union is considering whether to have a town hall to discuss mental health with workers and gauge whether workers have the resources and support that they need. \"It's going to be a combination of stress over time that's going to get to people,\" he said. While doctors, nurses and other health-care workers face even more challenging circumstances as they care for sick and dying patients, grocery workers face unique hardships, he said. Many live in multigenerational households where the stakes of catching and spreading the coronavirus are higher. And the hourly workers do not have the training, higher pay and protective gear that usually comes with hazardous or life-or-death jobs, he said. Unlike a nurse or doctor, he said hourly workers may not have the same level of awareness and may resist seeking help. \"There's a certain stigma that's sometimes attached that shouldn't be,\" he said. \"That's a challenge, for sure.\" Nearly 1 in 5 U.S. adults live with a mental illness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. There are wide disparities in access to mental health care, however, and cost is the most commonly reported barrier, according to research by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Lack of health insurance or the cost of deductibles and copayments for those who do have insurance can dissuade lower-income families from seeking out the care. Use of the services is lower for blacks, Asians and Hispanics, too, and care can be out of reach for those who live in small towns or rural areas with few licensed professionals. Perrone said some companies have acknowledged the importance of their workers or referred to them as \"heroes\" to express appreciation or retain the workforce during a surge in demand. But he said he wonders how that will be weeks or months from now, when there are \"serious conversations about what people are going to need going forward.\" He said the needs will be greater, if there's a second round of the coronavirus in the fall or winter. \"People are pretty resilient as long as they see a light at the end of the tunnel,\" he said. \"If they can't see a light at the end of the tunnel, that's when I think that people kind of break a little bit.\" The APA's Wright said everyone deals with stress, such as when they take a test or interview for a job. With the pandemic, however, some hourly workers have faced stressful or frightening situations day after day. That not only can cause mental health problems, such as depression. It can also lead to physical ailments, such as high blood pressure, muscle tension and cardiovascular disease. \"It's this buildup of chronic stress over time that's problematic,\" she said.\n\nTouting mental health benefits\n\nOver the past few years, Walgreens has championed mental health because of its role as a community pharmacy and the number of related prescriptions it dispenses, said Kristin Oliver, chief human resources officer at Walgreens. The retailer began offering Mental Health First Aid, which was developed by the National Council for Behavioral Health. The mental health literacy program has taught hundreds of its pharmacists and human resources employees to recognize risk factors and warning signs, so they can guide others toward help. \"It's one of those areas that gets less attention than other areas of concern,\" Oliver said. \"We saw an opportunity to raise awareness and champion this in a more unique way than a lot of other pharmacies were.\" Oliver said every employee enrolled in benefits gets five free hours of counseling and access to teletherapy with a licensed therapist. During the pandemic, the company has encouraged employees to try a new tool, too: Sanvello, a clinically based mental health app. Walmart provides three free counseling sessions to its part-time and full-time employees through its employee assistance program, said Adam Stavisky, Walmart's senior vice president of U.S. benefits. It also offers Doctor On Demand, a telehealth provider to those who have benefits through Walmart. \"The telehealth utilization is going up stratospherically,\" he said. Within that, it's seen a \"tremendous upsurge\" in use of counseling, he said, adding that the company is pleased to see employees \"avail themselves of the resources we have.\" During the pandemic, the retailer has waived its $4 copay for telehealth visits, including those for behavioral health, he said. It also has digital tools that encourage resiliency and provide peer support. \"Our goal is to continue to support our associates as best we can,\" he said. \"They are literally stocking the shelves for America.\"\n\nA growing need", "author": ["Melissa Repko"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/a-long-way-to-go-before-theres-enough-testing-to-reopen-economy-business-roundtable-ceo-says.html", "published": "2020-04-16T19:25:32", "title": "'A long way to go' before there's enough testing to reopen economy, Business Roundtable CEO says", "text": "The United States needs to see increased testing for the coronavirus before businesses can begin to reopen, Business Roundtable President and CEO Joshua Bolten said Thursday.\n\n\"We've clearly got a long way to go, but there's progress being made every day ... all the CEOs in our organization agree that testing is an absolutely crucial gating element to getting us back and running safely,\" Bolten said on CNBC's \"Power Lunch.\" \"So everything we can do to expand the availability of fast and accurate testing is going to be probably the most crucial element to reopening promptly and safely.\"\n\nThe lack of testing for the virus has been one of the main issues facing the U.S. during the pandemic, with many places limiting who could be tested as the virus spread across the country.

The company is also maintaining an updated travel restriction directory page where hosts and guests can check restriction orders from around the globe .\n\nHeading into the year, the San Francisco tech company was eyeing an entry into the public markets. The company had lined up bankers to lead the offering, which would test whether Airbnb could live up to its $31 billion private market valuation from 2017. Instead, the company is raising $2 billion in new debt funding at a valuation of $18 billion. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that Airbnb lost $322 million over the first nine months of last year, after reporting a $200 million profit in 2018, as it ramped up spending.\n\nFor Airbnb, these government restrictions are the latest obstacle in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic has devastated the entire travel industry. Last month, Airbnb told its employees that it would institute a hiring freeze, suspend its marketing, cut executives' salary and that it did not expect to give out bonuses for 2020.\n\nThese measures are necessary to stop the spread of the coronavirus, according to government officials who spoke with CNBC. But hosts say the restrictions can be confusing, and they are putting additional pressure on small business-owners who rely on short-term bookings to cover their mortgages and bills.\n\nFrom Maine to the Coachella Valley in California, state and local governments have passed measures to prevent property managers from booking short-term rentals through websites like Airbnb, Vrbo and Booking.com.\n\nShort-term rentals have been banned across the entire states of Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Delaware, Maine and Vermont. Numerous other counties and cities have taken similar steps, including Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Sonoma County, California.\n\nThese temporary bans are the latest headache for short-term rental hosts, many of whom are already reeling from a wave of cancellations from vacationers who have not been able to travel as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In some cases, these cancellations have cost hosts thousands of dollars in lost revenue, according to numerous hosts who have spoken with CNBC.\n\n\"It's already hard enough to operate in this kind of slower travel economy,\" said Sean Rakidzich, who manages approximately 100 Airbnb properties across the U.S. \"But the moment the government says you're not allowed to operate, there's nothing you can do. There's no best practices to operate your business when it's illegal to operate.\"\n\nFor Anneliese Caserta and her husband, local bans have ended bookings to their Airbnb properties in Reddington, Florida, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The state of Florida and city of Myrtle Beach have both banned short-term rentals through April, although Florida is still allowing hotels and other similar businesses to operate.\n\n\"We have to decline reservations every single day. It's unbelievable,\" Caserta said. \"To me it seems that the safest place to be if you're going to go on vacation is a house. I think it would be safer than a hotel, pressing elevator buttons and sharing doors with everybody in close quarters.\"\n\nA spokesman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told CNBC that the decision to suspend vacation rentals is part of his approach to deter the travel of individuals into the state and combat the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, vacation rentals are a great and popular way for families and large groups of people to enjoy our coastline or major attractions,\" the spokesman said in a statement. \"Given the need to limit these groups from traveling to the state during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Governor feels it is prudent to temporarily restrict vacation rentals.\"\n\nCaserta still has bookings for May and June. She would like to honor those reservations, but if Florida and Myrtle Beach extend their bans, she would like to know sooner rather than later so that she can convert her properties into long-term rentals and generate some revenue that can go toward paying the properties' bills.\n\n\"We're just in limbo hoping for the best,\" she said.\n\nFor some hosts, keeping up with local orders can be confusing. Liam McLaughlin, who manages 14 properties in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said he understands there is an order restricting short-term rentals but finding details has been difficult.\n\nMcLaughlin cites an email sent by Jessica Walls-Lavelle, the southwest region director for the office of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, that says short-term rentals for vacations are banned, but hosts may still rent to guests in the military, medical and emergency workers as well as \"travelers engaged in non-vacation commercial activities.\"\n\nMcLaughlin said he now asks his guests if they are traveling for non-vacation commercial reasons. If they say yes, he accepts their reservation.\n\n\"How do you define someone who's there for a non-vacation commercial activity?\" said McLaughlin, noting that one of his guests is a mom who is in town to help her college-age son move off campus. \"Is that a non-vacation commercial activity?\"\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp on April 8 announced that the state would ban short-term rentals at least until April 30.\n\n\"This action is one of many steps that we are taking to keep people safe from this dangerous virus,\" Kemp said in a news conference.\n\nAs a result of that ban, Preston Czigans said he was forced to cancel Airbnb reservations for his property in Ellijay, Georgia. Czigans had to contact Airbnb support to ensure his host rating was not affected and avoid fees for the cancellations.

The delay could be due to a glitch related to your tax preparation service. A new report from The Washington Post on Thursday estimates that millions of Americans could still be waiting to see their stimulus money if they previously filed their taxes with companies such as H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt and TurboTax. Those companies offer services where consumers can get refunds due from their tax returns immediately for a fee. The money is often provided through debit cards that are attached to temporary bank accounts. The government is using that information from past tax years, particularly 2018 and 2019, to send the one-time stimulus payments. Consequently, the IRS may not have those individuals' direct deposit information on file to make the payments. Admittedly, this would only affect a portion of these companies' clients, those who opt for what's known as refund anticipation loans.\n\nThe Treasury Department is urging consumers who used these types of advances for their 2018 or 2019 tax filings to access the Get My Payment web app to enter their direct deposit information, a spokeswoman for the agency said. In addition to your bank account information, you will also need to know the amount of your last tax refund. The new web app was difficult for many individuals to access when it first went live this week because of high volume. So far, it has successfully captured the direct deposit information for millions of Americans, the spokeswoman said. The blame can't be pinned entirely on the IRS for the mishap, said Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. \"This is an agency that's been chronically underfunded, has had to deal with antiquated computer systems,\" Wu said. \"They're short on staff and they just stood up an entire system to process 80 million direct deposits and multiple new websites in a matter of weeks.\" In a statement, TurboTax, which is owned by Intuit Inc., denied the refund issue is a problem for its customers. \"The bank account information for TurboTax filers is transmitted to the IRS as a part of the tax return,\" said TurboTax spokeswoman Ashley McMahon. \"The IRS has the appropriate banking information for all TurboTax filers, which can be used by them to distribute stimulus payments.\" Some TurboTax customers have chosen to receive their stimulus payments through either a refund transfer or debit card, McMahon said. But that should not preclude those taxpayers from getting their money. \"Any TurboTax customer who selected refund transfer or a debit card that gets a stimulus payment sent from the IRS to those accounts will receive those stimulus payments without delay or fees,\" McMahon said. Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Jackson Hewitt said the company is sending consumers with questions to the Get My Payment app.\n\nConsumers beware", "author": ["Lorie Konish"]}]}, "cnbc_investing": {"rss": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/15839069/device/rss/rss.html", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/investing/", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/elon-musk-spacex-falcon-9-rocket-over-a-million-dollars-less-to-insure.html", "published": "2020-04-16T16:25:27", "title": "Elon Musk touts low cost to insure SpaceX rockets as edge over competitors", "text": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks at a press conference where he announced the Japanese billionaire chosen by the company to fly around the moon, on September 17, 2018 in Hawthorne, California.

Insurance on a launch is \"the acid test\" for the reliability of a rocket, Musk added in another tweet. A top space insurance underwriter, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNBC that Musk's reference is true for insurance premiums, which are based on the rocket's price tag, but not for the insurance rate, which is based on the market's perceived reliability of the rocket. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a $62 million price tag. The insurance rate on a Falcon 9 is about 4% currently, the underwriter said. That's the same rate as competitors' similarly-capable rockets, such as the European launcher Arianespace's Ariane 5 or U.S. rocket builder United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Atlas V. But Ariane 5 and Atlas V launches go for upwards of $165 million each, meaning a Falcon 9 premium is about $2.5 million while its competitors' premiums would be in the range of $7 million.\n\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station carrying 60 Starlink satellites on November 11, 2019 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Paul Hennessy | NurPhoto | Getty Images\n\nIn essence, the underwriter said a Falcon 9 mission is cheaper to insure because the rocket costs less than competitors' \u2013 not necessarily because it is seen as more reliable. The underwriter added that Musk's method of comparing insurance premiums is additionally misleading given that launch insurance is almost always based on more than just the cost of a rocket itself. A launch insurance policy typically includes the cost of the launch vehicle, the price of the spacecraft it's launching and the amount paid for the insurance, the underwriter explained.

But with 30% to 50% declines in some stocks in the past two months, even with the rally, previously modest dividend yields of 2% to 3% are now in the 4%, 5% or 6% range for many companies and they are unsustainable given much lower cash flows.\n\nSome investors seem to feel the drop in dividends will be substantial.

The Washington-based organization now expects the global economy to contract by 3% in 2020. By contrast, in January it had forecast a global GDP (gross domestic product) expansion of 3.3% for this year. \"It is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago,\" Gita Gopinath, the IMF's chief economist, said in the latest World Economic Outlook report. In January, the IMF had estimated 3.4% growth for global GDP in 2021; this has now been revised up to 5.8% (although growth is expected to be coming from a lower base following 2020's projected contraction). Speaking to CNBC Tuesday, Gopinath said: \"This is a crisis where the economic shock is something that is not exactly controlled by economic policy,\" as it's unclear when the pandemic will end.\n\nGreat Depression vs. Great Lockdown\n\nThe IMF's chief economist also said that in comparison to the Great Depression, \"we are (now) better off on the health front. On the economic front, I think it makes a big difference that there are lenders of last resort, that monetary policy is proactively able to come in and ensure enough liquidity in markets, that fiscal policy is able to play a major role in supporting firms and households.\" The IMF expects a \"partial recovery\" in 2021, provided that the pandemic eases throughout this year.\n\nThe dramatic downgrade in this year's growth expectations comes as other institutions also warn that the coronavirus outbreak is bringing massive economic challenges. The World Trade Organization said last week that global trade will contract by between 13% and 32% this year. The Organization for Economic Coordination and Development has also warned the economic hit from the virus will be felt \"for a long time to come.\" To contain the spread of the virus, many governments have implemented lockdown measures, only allowing people to leave their houses to purchase groceries, medicines and, in some cases, to exercise. As a result, business activity has stalled in many countries. The IMF, which dubbed the current crisis \"the Great Lockdown,\" said \"this is a crisis like no other.\" Speaking at a press conference, Tuesday, Gopinath explained \"the magnitude and speed of collapse in activity that has followed (the lockdown) is unlike anything we've experienced in our lifetimes.\"\n\nInequality can go up\n\nThere's severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the economic shock, and stimulating economic activity is more challenging given the required social distancing and isolation policies. The IMF said it had received \"an unprecedented number of calls for emergency funding.\" Out of its 189 members, more than 90 of them have asked for financial support. The fund, which provides financing to members which are struggling economically, has $1 trillion in lending capacity. When speaking to CNBC, Gopinath said: \"When you have a deep recession of this kind, there is always unfortunately tremendous loss of income for people at the lower end of the income scale, so poverty can go up, inequality can go up.\"\n\nEuro zone to be hit the hardest\n\nThe latest forecasts from the IMF suggest that the U.S. economy will contract by 5.9% this year. In comparison, the euro zone is expected to shrink by 7.5%, but China is seen growing by 1.2% in 2020. The economic situation will be particularly difficult in Italy and Spain, where GDP is set to contract by 9.1% and 8%, respectively. These two countries are the worst hit in Europe by Covid-19.

Kevin Dietsch | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBanks are scrambling to process a growing backlog of applications for the U.S. program designed to funnel at least $350 billion in relief to small businesses struggling during the coronavirus pandemic. Massive demand for the program in its first week has been met with several time-consuming bottlenecks at lenders and with the Small Business Administration portal the companies use to get loans approved. For instance, the two biggest U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, had a combined 625,000 in requests for $80 billion in loans as of Tuesday. But because the companies are relying on armies of employees to manually take in customers' information, verify loan amounts and input data into the SBA system, only a small fraction of that has actually been paid out so far, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan acknowledged that while his firm was the first major lender to begin accepting applications last week, it has contributed only a \"modest amount\" to the figure of completed deals. \"We are beginning to process those through to the SBA,\" Moynihan said Tuesday during a White House briefing. To speed the process, \"it will take an automated feed, which the SBA team is working hard to get set up because when this starts coming, it's coming with a lot of volume.\" The delays in accepting applications, processing them and disbursing money are heightening anxiety and confusion about the Paycheck Protection Program, a cornerstone of the Trump administration's $2 trillion response to the coronavirus crisis. It was designed to give small businesses a lifeline with government-backed loans that are forgiven if used for payroll or other approved expenses.\n\nHour to complete?\n\nBig banks had just a few days to create digital portals for the loan program and are working on ways to automate the intake of customer data, vetting of applications including the sizes of loans and entry into the SBA's E-Tran portal. Once that occurs, it should drastically speed up the process. But the issues have been compounded by two major factors outside banks' control: Problems with the SBA's antiquated E-Tran system and waiting for technical language from the agency on promissory notes and authorization forms, according to industry sources. E-Tran was unavailable for most of Monday and even when it was online, operating it is slow and balky, according to several bankers at large and small institutions. The system, which handled $28 billion in loans all of last year, forces users to restart applications if they are off by a single letter. One bank said that a single application took well over an hour to complete. While the SBA has denied problems with E-Tran, an industry group took the rare step of publicly rebuking the administration's technology, saying in an April 4 letter to the Treasury and the SBA that \"community bankers are frustrated with failed technology links and portals.\" On top of that, in the first days of the program, the SBA warned lenders that the system was generating erroneous forms: \"Please do not close any loans using the current version of the loan authorization!\" Some banks are using their own promissory notes, meaning they run the risk that the SBA could reject the loan for forgiveness, according to the people. Loans with built-in forgiveness are unusual, and banks are treading carefully. \"We haven't gotten the promissory note and the authorization form,\" said one of the people. \"It's not about banks being sticklers. If the SBA later says an 'I' is not dotted or a 'T' is not crossed, then the loan isn't eligible for forgiveness and the business owner might have to repay it.\"\n\nMountain of applications", "author": ["Hugh Son Dawn Giel", "Hugh Son", "Dawn Giel"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/the-fed-is-lifting-wells-fargos-asset-cap-so-it-can-help-lend-to-small-business.html", "published": "2020-04-08T21:39:12", "title": "The Fed is modifying Wells Fargo's asset cap so it can help lend to small business", "text": "The Federal Reserve is modifying the asset cap it has imposed on Wells Fargo so the bank can participate in the government's business lending programs.\n\nThe change allows the bank to participate in the central bank's business lending program without having it count against the $1.95 trillion cap that will remain in place.\n\nIn a move that was expected, the central bank said Wells will have to return proceeds it gets from the Payment Protection Plan and a coming Main Street lending program either back to the Treasury Department or to a nonprofit.\n\nThe Fed had imposed the restrictions following the bank's fake account scandal in which it created millions of accounts for customers without their knowledge.

Airbus and Rolls Royce have decided to do the same.\n\nEnergy behemoths such as Exxon Mobile and Royal Dutch, which have paid generous dividends in the past, are resorting to cuts in capital spending and raising additional funds, just to keep their dividend promises.\n\nThe spotlight is on U.S. banks next. After the Reserve Bank of New Zealand asked banks in the country to put dividends on hold, Australia's financial regulator followed suit by pushing local banks to do the same.\n\nUK banks have halted payments and there are growing concerns that U.S. banks may cut dividends too.\n\nDuhra of Janus Henderson told CNBC that he has reduced allocations to both energy & banks recently for a number of reasons, including worries around companies' ability to pay dividends.\n\nThe same view holds for real estate investment trusts or REITS in Singapore that were dividend darlings until recently.\n\n\"This sector is a now a real concern with respect to dividends, and anything with exposure to retail and hospitality will continue to face pressure. We have sold any exposure to these areas. Singapore REITs have not shown the defensive qualities expected by investors and there may be further stress if dividends do indeed get cut. This is not currently a sector we are looking to add to.\"\n\nGiven the spate of dividend suspensions, some investors are voicing their displeasure. HSBC investors have called for an extraordinary general meeting to explore options for action against the bank for culling its dividend due this year, the Financial Times reported.\n\nStill, investors may have limited options to extract payouts from companies that have decided to suspend dividends.\n\nJanus Henderson's Duhra said the dividend policy of a company is at the discretion of the board and it is unusual for companies to guarantee dividends.\n\n\"Dividends tend to be linked to earnings\", he said, \"which gives companies room to reduce dividends if profits fall sharply.\"\n\nAs per Janus Henderson's global dividend index report published late February, companies in Japan and the U.S. ranked the highest in terms of delivering high dividend growth to shareholders in the last decade.\n\nCompanies in Europe lagged their global peers while those in Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada did well in 2019.\n\nOil dividends rose the fastest in 2019 with technology being the leader in dividend payments in the last 10 years.\n\nWhile large swathes of financial markets have been rumbled, dividend stocks in select sectors still offer potential to investors, according to Credit Suisse, which believes that investor concerns relate to the ability to pay, the willingness to pay and the potential for dividend delays.\n\nWhile recognizing the current economic realities, the bank is recommending greater exposure to consumer staples, healthcare, real estate and telecom stocks.\n\nCredit Suisse has recently added companies such as Sanofi, BAE Systems, Philip Morris and Elisa to its conviction list while removing big names like Blackrock and BP due to concerns over the sectors they represent.", "author": ["Tanvir Gill"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/07/exxon-cuts-capital-spending-by-30percent-but-ceo-says-its-committed-to-maintaining-dividend.html", "published": "2020-04-07T20:42:33", "title": "Exxon cuts capital spending by 30%, but CEO says it's 'committed to maintaining' dividend", "text": "Exxon is slashing its 2020 capital spending plan as depressed oil prices hammer the energy sector, but CEO Darren Woods said that the company's dividend is safe for the time being.\n\n\"A lot of our shareholders are retail shareholders \u2014 people who depend on that dividend \u2014 so we've been pretty committed to maintaining that and if necessary in the short-term using the balance sheet to support it,\" Woods said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"It's a capital-intensive commodity business so we know we are going to go through cycles, and the way we have prepared ourselves to manage through those cycles is to maintain a strong balance sheet,\" he added.\n\nShares of Exxon rose 1.9% on Tuesday, although the stock has shed more than 40% this year.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company said that it was reducing capital spending for 2020 by 30 % \u2014 from $33 billion to around $23 billion \u2014 and cutting operating expenses by about 15%. The largest share of the reduction will be in the Permian Basin, where it's easier to adjust short-cycle investments, Woods said.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude has slid 56% this year as the coronavirus outbreak has sapped demand. At the beginning of the year, a barrel of WTI fetched more than $60. Today, it trades around $26.44, hammering the highly-leveraged energy sector as producers struggle to break even with lower prices.\n\n\"The fact that we've lost 23% of demand here in a very short order, that's a huge transition for the industry to make. ... Capacity has to come offline and there will be economics that drive that, that force the producers to shut-in,\" Woods said. \"The market will address the shut in, and drive levels down, frankly, because there's no demand for the product and so eventually you have to stop making it.\"\n\nFurther hammering oil is a price war that broke out between Saudi Arabia and Russia in early March after the last round of OPEC+ talks ended without a deal on production cuts. After the prior cuts expired on April 1, Saudi Arabia was among the nations that ramped up its production, despite the fall-off in demand. The group is set to meet on Thursday to discuss possible production cuts, and there have been calls for nations outside of OPEC+, including the U.S., to participate.\n\nWoods said that the company doesn't factor the decision-making of OPEC into how it operates its business.\n\n\"We've always focused very much on the fundamentals and trying to understand what the demand in the world would be over time, and making sure that as a producer the supply that we bring into the market is low-cost and therefore can effectively compete with other low-cost producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia,\" he said.\n\nLooking forward, Woods is confident that there will be a recovery, but said the company is prepared to scale back even further if necessary.\n\n\"We have additional options to further reduce spending if necessary. I think with the uncertainty we want to keep those options available to us, and as we move through the next month or so we'll keep a very close eye on the market and continue to adjust if we feel the need to.\"\n\nIn the short-term, Woods said the dividend is a high-priority, but that \"it will be a function of how long this plays out.\" \"If we haven't seen a recovery next year, you know it will be a different environment that we're in,\" he said.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.", "author": ["Pippa Stevens"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/07/war-bonds-could-fund-coronavirus-fightheres-how-they-could-work.html", "published": "2020-04-07T12:38:34", "title": "Op-ed: 'War bonds' could finance the fight against coronavirus \u2014 here's how they could work", "text": "My colleague, Jim Cramer, made a very interesting recommendation Monday morning, calling on the U.S. Treasury to issue a $1 trillion, 30-year \"war bond\" to finance our battle against the coronavirus.\n\nHe pitched the idea on CNBC to Larry Kudlow, who chairs the White House National Economic Council and promised to propose the idea directly to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe U.S., of course, has issued war bonds in the past, and in the context of actual military conflicts, both in World Wars I and II.\n\nThe government back in 1917 went so far as to enlist the help of celebrities such as Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and Ethyl Barrymore to sell Liberty Bonds.\n\nBob Hope, Bing Crosby, Barbara Stanwyck and Humphrey Bogart aided a similar effort during World War II.\n\nThis time around, perhaps, JLo, Kanye West, George Clooney and Jennifer Aniston might oblige.\n\nPatriotic Americans snapped up the bonds and helped finance the war efforts.\n\nSimilarly, today, the U.S. is engaged in a war against a virus that has brought economic activity to a virtual halt, causing unemployment to immediately skyrocket and a possible plunge in second-quarter gross national product by 30%, or more.\n\nThe war-bond concept is a solid one insofar as demand for high-quality debt is rising among institutional and individual investors.\n\nI have long been in favor of the U.S. extending the maturity of its borrowings since the Great Recession drove interest rates to record lows.\n\nThe U.S., however, has not been terribly aggressive in marketing such debt instruments, and lenders haven't been terribly enthusiastic about trading away higher yields for the near certainty that the U.S., still a AAA credit, will pay them back in full. However, this could be one of those moments where the borrow and lender come to mutual agreement on a long-dated Treasury that yields 2%.\n\nIn addition to America's relatively high credit quality, it also is still borrowing at higher rates than most of the rest of the world.\n\nEven if the U.S. deficits surge, estimated to climb as high as 7% to 10% of the nation's GDP in the next two years, America's debt-to-GDP ratio, while growing, will remain below those of Japan, China, Italy and most other developed countries, reducing the relative risk of buying a U.S. bond.\n\nOne issue may require some assistance from the Federal Reserve to blunt potential principal losses to those who buy the bonds.\n\nThe \"duration\" of a 30-year bond with a 2% yield, is just over 22 years, meaning a bondholder's breakeven on such a long-term bond is around 22 years.\n\nIn the meantime, the principal value of a long-term bond fluctuates more wildly with every 1% move interest rates than do short-term debt instruments.\n\nIt's a factor that keeps many from snapping up high quality but lower-yielding securities whose maturities are three decades out.\n\nSome investors have speculated that the Federal Reserve may put a cap on Treasury yields all along the yield curve.\n\nNow, the Fed cannot guarantee that it will hold 30-year bond yields at, or below, 2% forever. However, by using its forward guidance, the Fed can say it will cap the curve unless or until inflation rises above a new numerical target, or when nominal growth exceeds a certain threshold, say 5%.\n\nSuch a move would reduce the risk of owning long-dated Treasurys and make the issuance of a war bond far more palatable than leaving the interest rate market to its own devices.\n\nGiven that the Treasury and the Fed, via the recent CARE bill passed by Congress, are now working in concert in ways never before seen, such a mutually reinforcing arrangement would help the U.S. dig its way out of this biologic shock and pave the way for the government to finance much-needed relief \u2014 now and in the months to come.", "author": ["Ron Insana"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/strategists-younger-investors-have-recently-been-buying-cruise-stocks.html", "published": "2020-04-07T14:07:29", "title": "Younger investors have been buying shares of cruise companies, two strategists say", "text": "Younger investors have lately been buying shares of cruise lines, two Wall Street strategists told CNBC on Monday.\n\nTD Ameritrade's JJ Kinahan said Royal Caribbean and Carnival Corp. have been two stocks that the brokerage firm's millennial clients have added to their portfolio in the month of March.\n\n\"At first you might be like, 'Oh my god, that seems like a terrible idea,'\" Kinahan, the firm's chief market strategist, said on \"Closing Bell.\"\n\n\"But again, if you're a millennial client you may look at that and say, 'Longer term, these make sense to me.'\"\n\nThe younger investors particularly started to add exposure to the cruise lines in the last two weeks of the month, Kinahan added in a follow-up call.\n\nIn addition to a long-term belief that the cruise lines could recover from their coronavirus-driven sell-offs, Kinahan said younger clients may be interested in the stocks for a personal reason.\n\n\"They may be some of the first customers who are willing to jump back in to do cruises,\" he said.", "author": ["Kevin Stankiewicz"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/two-employees-of-jeff-bezos-space-venture-blue-origin-test-positive-for-coronavirus.html", "published": "2020-04-06T21:22:05", "title": "Two employees of Jeff Bezos' space venture, Blue Origin, test positive for coronavirus", "text": "Jeff Bezos' space venture Blue Origin confirmed on Monday that two employees at its Seattle-area headquarters tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThe employees, who are married couple, work at Blue Origin's headquarters in Kent, Washington, and one was last at the company's office as late as Friday.

With even month-old economic numbers of scant relevance in a post-lockdown world, attention has turned to how the market's dramatic repricing stacks up to recessions past, and how the market reacts to its own extremes in terms of technical behavior.\n\nThe S&P 500's heartbreaker of a 34% decline in about a month, culminating two weeks ago, matches up roughly with the sort of setback that accompanied \"typical\" recessions of the past. The near-20% rebound rally and subsequent 6% backslide through last week also map to the aftermath of earlier cascading index collapses. This suggests we're in a phase of choppy aftershocks and jumpy rallies that often \u2014 but certainly not always \u2014 leads toward another test of investors' nerve via a return to the vicinity of those panicky initial lows.\n\nLast week, stocks were down some 2%, but failed to break down significantly despite a load of lousy news, from accelerating outbreaks in additional states, to brutal 6-million new weekly unemployment claims, to huge retailers furloughing hundreds of thousands of employees collectively. To some observers, this was a win in the form of losing less.\n\nCoronavirus vs the VIX\n\nThe slouching rather than collapsing nature of the drop was reflected in the S&P 500 Volatility Index sliding below 47 from 65, and from a peak a few weeks ago above 80. While not anything like an \"all clear\" signal, this drop shows the market has moved on from outright shock to grinding resignation that things are bad and will be so for a while. It also means traders bought an enormous amount of downside protection during March and so have less need to bid for option hedges now. Jason Hunter, technical strategist at JPMorgan, has been plotting various indicators of disease incidence with market indicators, including one tracking the number of states with 10%-plus daily Covid-19 case growth against the VIX. Source: JPMorgan Of course, almost any two variables can be made to appear correlated. And no doubt this somewhat-engineered statistical relationship will break down (states with rapid case growth will, at some point, reach zero and the VIX never will, for example). But there is some internal logic in the idea that when the propagation of the virus has seemed most unchecked, the urgency of selling and trader panic levels were most intense. Both have subsided for now.\n\n\"Based on the recent correlation, case growth deceleration\u2026can help put further downward pressure on implied equity volatility and blunt the nature of a retest of the march equity price low,\" Hunter says. He expects the March S&P lows between 2150 and 2200 to hold as this quarter's floor, with rallies capped perhaps 12% above Friday's closing level, as the waiting game plays out. Similarly, Julian Emmanuel of BTIG says, \"If history is any sort of guide, we expect a 'divergent' retest of the March lows in April, as the public health and economic bad news is likely to reach its parabolic peak in coming weeks prior to the (aspirational?) date for easing social distancing, April 30.\"\n\nCredit markets ticking clock\n\nThe credit market will have plenty to say about whether such an equity floor can hold and any rallies get traction. Corporate-debt markets are always crucial indicators for stocks, reflecting liquidity, risk-appetite and macro conditions in a fairly focused way.

And this brings me to my current fascination with the fate of the sectors worst-hit by the coronavirus: airlines, hotels, and casinos.\n\nI have observed the evolution of these businesses over the decades. I've watched their tremendous expansion driven by commercial globalization, and their strategic initiatives toward shedding costly real estate and fleets of the largest passenger planes, such as 747's. The result has been higher profit margins, built on leaner operations with less cushion, defined by extra employees, planes, or room ownership.\n\nAs COVID-19 has inflicted near-mortal wounds on the travel and leisure industries, managements have invoked retention of their workers as a key consideration in their appeal for help. According to recent data, the airline, casino, and hotel industries employ about 450,000, 750,000 and 2.3 million people, respectively, or over 2% of the American workforce.\n\nThe government has listened, including in the Federal bailout package, or CARES, a $25 billion provision for the airline industry and $454 billion targeted to large employers in distress, a term easily applied to both hotels and casinos. At the same time, some political leaders and investors have criticized some managements of these companies for their use of cash to repurchase shares over the past few years.\n\nHilton, with a current market value of $16.1 billion, has spent $4.1 billion over the past three years on share buybacks, and American Airlines purchased nearly $12 billion of shares since 2015 on a market cap that sits at only $4.3 billion today.\n\nHow should investors assess these and other actions in light of the dire COVID-19-related predicament? It helps to examine some of the calculated risks at airlines, hotels and casinos that have both contributed to the growth in operating margins but also put them at greater risk should the economy shift down dramatically.\n\nIn the past ten years, as interest rates have fallen to record low levels, businesses have been incentivized to use cheap money to expand.\n\nAs might be expected, long-term, debt-to-equity for these sectors has risen. Hilton has $9 billion of long-term debt and no equity; Marriott, after its $13 billion acquisition of Starwood, has $10.8 billion in long-term debt against $0.7 billion of equity; and Wynn Resorts' comparable numbers at $10.2 billion of debt and $1.7 billion of equity. Several airline bankruptcies in the Great Recession wiped out airline debt, so their balance sheets appear cleaner than their growth would suggest.\n\nWhether corporations own, lease, or franchise their planes, hotels and casinos, the major players have expanded their scope significantly. Airline available seat miles, for example, soared, figuratively, up 140% since 2011, while revenue per average seat mile for the domestic carriers has remained within a tight range.\n\nTo cover their higher annual debt or lease payments, the travel and lodging industries have needed to fill more seats and rooms. Sure enough, load factor for the airline industry has risen from the mid-70% range in the early 2000's to 85% recently while occupancy for US hotels has climbed from around 59% at the start of the millennium to 66% last year.\n\nWhen the state of Massachusetts decided to legalize casinos, Wynn jumped at the chance. It proposed an extravagant casino/hotel in a densely populated neighborhood of a town adjacent to Boston, difficult to reach and without ample parking. Their early outlook, suggesting close to $220 million in first full year operating profits, will prove wildly optimistic, even in a normal environment.\n\nIn the aftermath of Covid-19, closing all leisure facilities across the country, Wynn has appealed to the state of Massachusetts and federal government for tax relief and bailout assistance, citing its hefty 5,000-person workforce. As Wynn's management might have badly miscalculated the payoff for the project, should its share of a bailout be judged primarily on the size of its staff? Likewise, should some other criteria be used for Hilton, whose share repurchase followed its spin-out, with abundant debt, from Blackstone, or American Airlines after its jumbo-jet-sized share purchase?\n\nAt first glance, I thought there should be some penalty right now for imprudent risk-taking prior to this crisis, based on measures of debt, liquidity, stock repurchases, etc. But I've since changed my mind.\n\nHopefully, this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Those workers need to receive income from Wynn, Delta Air Lines, and Marriott by way of the bailout, or they will get it another way, straight from the government. Call it a transfer payment, a shifted wage responsibility, or unemployment insurance, but we need to do it and it is easier to have them stay within the company.\n\nIn addition, the federal government should learn from Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008, which successfully ventilated the entire financial system that was imploding under the weight of some very risky behavior. TARP handed out $442 billion, and, basically, broke even, despite the list of beneficiaries that a Who's Who of banking giants.\n\nThe government should attach some financial and operating strings to this bailout so taxpayers ultimately profit in the rebuild, particularly with the large corporations in the many industries left vulnerable when people can't go anyway.\n\nWhen they reopen the Encore in Las Vegas, I'll be there.\n\nKaren Firestone is chairman, CEO, and co-founder of Aureus Asset Management, an investment firm dedicated to providing contemporary asset management to families, individuals and institutions.", "author": ["Karen Firestone"]}]}, "marketwatch": {"rss": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss", "link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-lockdown-to-continue-for-at-least-three-weeks-raab-confirms", "published": "2020-04-16T19:17:57", "title": "UK lockdown measures could last until June, Raab says", "text": "Government says measures must go on because it is not clear whether the virus has peaked\n\nDominic Raab has warned the public that lockdown measures could last into June as ministers came under increasing pressure to set out a detailed plan to ease the stringent restrictions.\n\nSetting out plans for a minimum three-week extension to prevent a deadly \u201csecond peak\u201d of infections, Boris Johnson\u2019s stand-in said that any relaxation now would \u201csubstantially increase the number of deaths\u201d.\n\nAnd dispelling any hopes that the conditions would be lifted entirely before the May bank holiday, he said that there could be ongoing local lockdowns well into the summer to avoid new hotspots emerging.\n\nRaab said ministers had received \u201cvery clear advice\u201d from Sage, the expert scientific committee advising the government, that lifting restrictions now would risk a damaging second wave of infections, which would \u201csubstantially increase the number of deaths\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt would undo the progress made to date, and as a result, would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.\u201d\n\nHis announcement came as ministers faced new calls to explain how they intend to control the virus so that the lockdown can eventually be relaxed \u2013 with one adviser, Neil Ferguson, breaking ranks on Thursday to call for a \u201csingle-minded emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing\u201d.\n\nHe said the government needed to accelerate action as it had with Brexit and argued that a huge infrastructure of testing and contact tracing would need to be in place in order for the lockdown to be lifted without further peaks.\n\n\u201cWithout that, our estimates show we have relatively little leeway. If we relax measures too much, then we will see a resurgence in transmission,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme.\n\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, reacted to the criticism testily, saying Ferguson \u201cadvises government. He is not in the government.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed for a timescale on lifting restrictions, Raab pointed to Boris Johnson\u2019s remark of a month ago, on 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to \u201cturn the tide\u201d of the virus. \u201cThat, broadly, is the outline,\u201d Raab said. The UK is now in its fourth week of lockdown.\n\nPlay Video 3:27 What the UK's coronavirus death toll is not telling us \u2013 video explainer\n\nRaab set out five conditions that would need to be met before any loosening of the rules. These included a sustained fall in the daily death rate, and confidence that the supply of PPE and testing can meet future demand.\n\nIn a rebuke to rightwing commentators arguing for the lockdown to be lifted to alleviate the economic costs of having businesses shuttered and workers furloughed, Raab added that \u201cearly relaxation would do more damage to the economy over a longer period\u201d.\n\nRather than lifting the restrictions, Raab talked of \u201cadjusting\u201d them, adding: \u201cIt could mean relaxing measures in some areas, while strengthening measures in some other areas\u201d. A Downing Street source called the approach \u201ckeyhole surgery\u201d.\n\nHe stressed that while the infection rate had fallen in the community, \u201cwe have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes\u201d.\n\nHancock promised more testing and protective equipment for care home staff on Wednesday, with many reporting inadequate supplies and haphazard advice from the government.\n\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed the extension of the measures. \u201cI fully support the government\u2019s decision to extend the lockdown,\u201d he said. \u202a\u201cThe priority now must be to ensure we see a ramp-up in testing, that staff get the PPE they desperately need, and that more is done to protect our care homes from the virus. We also need clarity about what plans are being put in place to lift the lockdown when the time is right.\u201d\n\nRaab was deputising for the prime minister, who is convalescing at Chequers after being hospitalised with the virus. Downing Street said Boris Johnson was not involved in the decision to extend the restrictions, but that Raab had updated him by phone.\n\nOne Tory MP said it was \u201crightwingers in cabinet and the wider party\u201d who were pushing for an early exit from the lockdown, but that No 10 was highly cautious.\n\nA senior Westminster source with knowledge of the government\u2019s thinking said they believed a move towards contact tracing conducted by an army of trained people was about to become \u201cthe next big U-turn\u201d.\n\nPrevious reversals of government policy include the acknowledgement of the need for mass testing, the abandonment of the herd immunity strategy, and the realisation that an antibody test was harder to develop than first thought.\n\nAnother change of heart could be over the wearing of masks by members of the public. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty said this was \u201ca very live issue that we are re-examining\u201d. He said there was medical evidence of a \u201csmall\u201d effect on the transmission of the virus.\n\nAdvisers had previously suggested there was little benefit to wearing masks, but Whitty said: \u201cThe point about scientific advice is, it evolves.\u201d\n\nThe chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, also hinted at ongoing measures, saying the challenge was to get R \u2013 the transmission rate of the virus \u2013 below 1 and keep it there. \u201cThere may be a number of measures that need to be continued to allow that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be some changes that need to take place, around things like home-working.\u201d\n\nHancock will come under pressure to commit to a coordinated testing and contact tracing regime when he appears before a blockbuster select committee hearing on Friday, led by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt and attended by several other committee chairs as guests.\n\nHunt has long been pushing for a mass testing and tracing strategy, which was dismissed by the government\u2019s experts in mid-March when they moved from a policy of trying to contain the virus to trying to delay its peak.\n\nAt that point, on March 26, Dr Jenny Harries said testing and contact tracing was \u201cnot an appropriate mechanism as we go forward\u201d, despite the World Health Organization\u2019s exhortation to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d.\n\nThe government has since conceded the point on mass testing and begun to develop an app that can help trace contacts.

Germany, in comparison, has organised 101 such flights through the programme, repatriating a total of 21,815 of its citizens with EU cash.\n\nAbout 65,000 UK nationals around the world are still in need of repatriation compared to \u201cseveral thousand\u201d German nationals, according to figures obtained by the Guardian.\n\nA Foreign Office spokesman did not deny the accuracy of the data, which was shared by the UK with foreign consulates earlier this week.\n\nThe shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the numbers raised questions over the British government\u2019s repatriation policy. \u201cThe UK\u2019s reliance on commercial airlines has left far too many British citizens stranded abroad, with many concerned about running out of money or medication and increasingly anxious about how they will get home.\u201d\n\nShe said she had been \u201coverwhelmed with appeals for help from Britons\u201d, some of whom had lost thousands of pounds on cancelled flights.

I don\u2019t feel safe in the government\u2019s hands any more. Last week there were flights organised by France to Paris and Amsterdam, by Spain to Madrid. Iberia has another flight to Madrid tomorrow while Germany has another flight to Frankfurt and Switzerland has one to Zurich on Saturday. And what is our government doing? Nothing, it is embarrassing.\u201d\n\nShe had now resorted, she said, to begging other embassies for a seat on their flights; they had all responded \u201cpersonally\u201d with emails to say their flights were full.\n\nThe government has been severely criticised by MPs and constituents for the failure to act like other EU countries towards its own citizens in the face of a pandemic.\n\nIt was only on 30 March that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, two weeks after many countries had locked down, announced a \u00a375m effort to repatriate hundreds of thousands of British.\n\nUnder the EU\u2019s civil protection mechanism established in 2001 participating countries can recuperate, from the EU budget, 75% of the costs of organising emergency flights during times of natural disaster.\n\nThe six flights organised by the UK under the scheme took place in February and March carrying 1,125 Britons. Four of the flights were from Lima, Peru, and one each was chartered to transport people from the cities of Oakland in California, and Tokyo.\n\nThe flights also took home 122 EU nationals from Ireland, Germany, Romania, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, France, Latvia, Lithuania and Belgium.\n\nA further 672 UK nationals have been returned home on flights organised by other countries.\n\nRaab has also agreed to a weekly meeting with the foreign minister Nigel Adams, other MPs and Nandy, who have complained about the lack of rescue flights. Sources said the first meeting was \u201cvery useful\u201d.\n\nParticipants in this civil protection mechanism are the 27 EU member states, the UK and six \u201cparticipating states\u201d, namely Iceland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Turkey.\n\nExplaining the relatively low number of flights organised by the UK, sources said it was a condition of the mechanism that seats should be made available on flights to EU nationals but that this was not always possible given the number of Britons in need of rescue. The mechanism is also supposed to be used as a last resort.\n\nThese conditions have not stopped Germany flying its nationals back from all around the world, including from Bali, Brisbane, Sydney, Islamabad, Mumbai and Mexico City.\n\nGermany, which had an estimated 250,000 nationals affected by the travel lockdowns, of which about 50,000 were stranded, is by far the biggest user of the EU mechanism, ahead of France (18 flights), the Czech Republic (13), Spain (11) and Belgium (8). A total of 43,584 stranded people have been repatriated with EU funds.\n\nThe UK has faced an uphill battle getting its citizens back but about 1.3 million Britons have returned home since the outbreak began.\n\nA Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cThe UK has activated the civil protection mechanism on several occasions, as part of our international response to coronavirus, which helped repatriate British nationals and EU citizens.\u201d", "author": ["Daniel Boffey", "Lisa O'Carroll"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why", "published": "2020-04-16T12:45:26", "title": "Men are much more likely to die from coronavirus - but why?", "text": "Trend has been replicated in all nations, but scientists cannot yet fathom the cause\n\nMen are much more likely to die from coronavirus - but why?\n\nIt has been well publicised that Covid-19 discriminates by age and by underlying health conditions.\n\nBut it has become increasingly apparent that it also discriminates by sex, with the latest UK data from the Office for National Statistics revealing that men are almost twice as likely to die from the disease.\n\nThe trend was first seen in China, where one analysis found a fatality rate of 2.8% in men compared with 1.7% in women.\n\nSince then, the pattern has been mirrored in France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea, and now in the UK.\n\nIn Italy, men have accounted for 71% of deaths. In Spain, data released on Thursday suggests twice as many men as women have died and in the UK, of the 4,122 deaths registered, 2,523 were men and 1,599 women.\n\nPlay Video 4:59 Who is most at risk from coronavirus and why? \u2013 video explainer\n\nSo why are men more vulnerable?\n\n\u201cThe honest answer is none of us know what\u2019s causing the difference,\u201d said Prof Sarah Hawkes, director of the UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.\n\nEarly on, smoking was suggested as a likely explanation. In China, nearly 50% of men but only about 2% of women smoke, and so underlying differences in lung health were assumed to contribute to men suffering worse symptoms and outcomes.\n\nCoronavirus cases in Africa pass 2,400 amid fears for health services Read more\n\nThe smoking hypothesis was backed by a paper, published last month, that found smokers made up about 12% of those with less severe symptoms, but 26% of those who ended up in intensive care or died.\n\nSmoking might also act as an avenue for getting infected in the first place: smokers touch their lips more and may share contaminated cigarettes.\n\nBehavioural factors that differ across genders may also have a role. Some studies have shown that men are less likely to wash their hands, less likely to use soap, less likely to seek medical care and more likely to ignore public health advice. These are sweeping generalisations, but across a population could place men at greater risk.\n\nHowever, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries \u2013 in the UK, 16.5% of men smoke compared with 13% of women \u2013 the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.\n\n\u201cThe growing observation of increased mortality in men is holding true across China, Italy, Spain. We\u2019re seeing this across very diverse countries and cultures,\u201d said Sabra Klein, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\n\u201cWhen I see that, it makes me think that there must be something universal that\u2019s contributing to this. I don\u2019t think smoking is the leading factor.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:10 How do I know if I have coronavirus and what happens next? \u2013 video explainer\n\nPrevious research, including by Klein, has revealed that men have lower innate antiviral immune responses to a range of infections including hepatitis C and HIV. Studies in mice suggest this may also be true for coronaviruses, though Covid-19 specifically has not been studied.\n\n\u201cTheir immune system may not initiate an appropriate response when it initially sees the virus,\u201d Klein said.\n\nHormones can also play a role \u2013 oestrogen has been shown to increase antiviral responses of immune cells. And many genes that regulate the immune system are encoded on the X chromosome (of which men have one, and women have two) and so it is possible that some genes involved in the immune response are more active in women than in men.\n\nSex differences in the immune response to Covid-19 are likely to show up in antibody surveys that are taking place across the world. Klein said she had already reviewed papers on this from Chinese teams, who have tracked blood samples from patients over the course of infection. \u201cWe can expect more on this soon,\u201d she said.\n\nUltimately, Hawkes said, biology, lifestyle and behaviour were all likely to play a role.\n\nBut it will only be possible to tease out the exact balance when sex-disaggregated data is more widely available.\n\nAt the time of speaking, before the latest release by the ONS, Hawkes said it was disappointing that only six out of 20 countries had published such a breakdown for case numbers and deaths, according to figures compiled by Global Health 50/50, which Hawkes leads, and CNN. The latest data revealing significantly more male deaths in the UK adds further weight to concerns that men are more vulnerable when it comes to Covid-19.", "author": ["Hannah Devlin"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-latest-glance", "published": "2020-04-16T17:05:58", "title": "Coronavirus latest: at a glance", "text": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:\n\nGlobal coronavirus cases pass 2 million mark\n\nThe total number of coronavirus cases across the world has reached at least 2,090,110, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic.\n\nThe US has the highest number of cases with 640,291, followed by Spain, with 182,816.

But the disease has begun spreading rapidly within the large migrant worker community that Singapore relies on to staff many of its basic services, highlighting what rights groups say is a weak link in containment efforts.\n\nJapan declares nationwide state of emergency\n\nJapan has expanded its state of emergency to cover the entire country.\n\nShinzo Abe, the country\u2019s prime minister, told a special meeting of medical experts called to discuss the disease: \u201cAreas where a state of emergency should be carried out will be expanded from the seven prefectures to all prefectures.\u201d\n\nAccording to AFP, the declaration allows regional governors to urge people to stay indoors, but with no punitive measures or legal force the measure is weaker than strict lockdowns seen in other parts of the world.\n\nFacebook to warn users who \u2018like\u2019 misinformation\n\nFacebook will begin showing notifications to users who have interacted with posts that contain \u201charmful\u201d coronavirus misinformation, the company announced.\n\nThe new policy applies only to misinformation that Facebook considers likely to contribute to \u201cimminent physical harm\u201d, such as false claims about \u201ccures\u201d or statements that physical distancing is not effective.

I\u2019m about \u00a31,000 out of pocket as both companies are refusing to refund me, even though I paid the full balance long before I had to. They are only offering to defer the date but that is only helpful if I can get the time off work and the accommodation I originally booked is available. What is the best course of action?\u201d\n\nSeveral readers have asked about self-catering holidays in the UK that have been cancelled due to the lockdown. Are they entitled to a refund? While the Package Travel Regulations extend to package holidays in the UK, they do not cover accommodation-only bookings. Each accommodation provider has its own terms and conditions. Since quarantine, the majority have updated their terms to offer a change of date or credit note instead of a refund. Frustratingly, most providers are advising guests who want a refund to claim on their holiday insurance, even though, like Nick, few people take out insurance for a UK holiday. For Nick, the best, in fact the only, course of action is to accept the postponement and hope the companies he booked with will be flexible with new dates. The same advice applies to anyone with an accommodation booking: the only option is to contact the provider directly.\n\nExamples of companies offering credit notes or flexible booking include: Under the Thatch, a collection of holiday cottages mostly in Wales, which has introduced a flexible booking policy allowing anyone with a cottage stay due to start before 1 September 2020 to postpone to a later date in 2020 or 2021. Most property owners with accommodation on Sawday\u2019s and Canopy and Stars websites are also offering to change the date of the booking \u2013 or provide a credit note for a future booking.

Instead, carriers around the world have been forced to ground their fleets due to travel restrictions imposed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDuring this standstill, wider questions are occupying the industry: what steps would allow flying to restart, what will the pandemic mean for air travel, and will airlines \u2013 those that survive \u2013 ever be quite the same again?\n\nImmediate health-led restrictions\n\nAs Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), put it: \u201cWe are not expecting to restart the same industry that we closed a few weeks ago.\u201d\n\nAirlines are talking to regulators now for guidelines over how travel might resume while coronavirus remains a smaller, but uncertain, risk. Social distancing at airports and on planes is likely to persist, potentially reducing the number of occupied seats. EasyJet has said it expects to leave middle seats on planes empty as a short-term measure, to reduce the level of contact \u2013 a less onerous restriction while demand is low. Deeper cleaning of aircraft seems likely, and potentially the wearing of masks onboard.\n\nDe Juniac noted that China\u2019s airline travel restrictions are tougher now than during the height of its own outbreak, to limit reinfection from abroad \u2013 and national public health authorities and governments will dictate the procedures. But Iata hopes to find global consensus on sanitary measures to enable air travel again. Screening of travellers could be necessary: passenger temperatures were taken after the Sars crisis and a comparable coronavirus test, should one become widely available, could eventually restore confidence. Emirates announced it had trialled a rapid blood test, where the results are available in 10 minutes, on all passengers on one flight from Dubai to Tunisia this week.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Socially distancing airport staff wearing face masks at Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok. Photograph: Diego Azubel/EPA\n\nThe next industry shutdown could be swift\n\nHypermobility brought a disease from a Chinese city to just about everywhere before serious flight restrictions were put in place. There will be no delay next time. Any signs of a new virus outbreak \u2013 or a second wave of coronavirus \u2013 would surely be met with far quicker measures to block international flights, rather than leaving it to airlines to respond to falling demand in the months after a virus is detected.\n\nPublic demand \u2013 and trust\n\nAviation\u2019s optimists talk of pent-up demand for holidays; others wonder how many passengers will want to risk a vacation abroad. Many of the last European leisure trips were for ski resorts which proved, like cruise ships, major incubators and exporters of Covid-19. The depth of the accompanying economic recession will also be a factor. Airline analyst John Strickland, of JLS Consulting, says: \u201cEven if they have the money to fly, I think people will be apprehensive. Normal summer markets like Spain and Italy, even if they wanted to receive people commercially, might not welcome visitors now.\u201d\n\nAndrew Charlton, an aviation consultant, is also damning of the airlines\u2019 \u201ctin-eared response\u201d to the crisis by offering vouchers rather than refunds to customers on cancelled flights, in a desperate attempt to save cash. \u201cYes, passengers will travel by banking their vouchers \u2026 But people being burnt by that now aren\u2019t going to book ahead in future \u2013 it\u2019s collapsing confidence in booking.\u201d\n\nThe end of business travel\n\nHealth fears initially made companies halt work trips; now it is an expense that struggling firms will likely shelve. Strickland says: \u201cSome of those businesses will have disappeared, others have put travel bans in place, and all have discovered the joys of videoconferencing \u2013 the lucrative premium cabins on long-haul flights won\u2019t be full for a while. Whether all this is a permanent structural change remains to be seen, but even if it is not for ever, it will be a long recovery.\u201d\n\nSmaller planes, and fewer of them\n\nCoronavirus looks to have hastened the demise of the world\u2019s biggest planes, built for long-haul: both the relatively young Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747-400, the original jumbo, were on their way out anyway. Both models were among the first to be grounded this year as demand fell.\n\nGerman carrier Lufthansa has announced it would be permanently axing half its modern A380s, and retiring a similar number of its 747s early. Charlton thinks it is just the start: \u201cYou will never see a 747 flying again, and the only A380s will have Emirates painted on the side.\u201d\n\nIs the environmental gain permanent?\n\nCoronavirus has meant a bigger instant fall in emissions than any green campaigner could have dared to dream. Many now demand that state bailouts of bankrupt carriers should have environmental conditions attached.\n\nIata has said the industry remains committed to green targets \u2013 but airlines may be more reluctant to proclaim net-zero ambitions or invest in sustainable jet fuel plants. Already the UN-backed global offsetting scheme, Corsia, could face renegotiation. And while bigger carriers will jettison older planes, they may also decide to defer orders, as easyJet has done for part of a \u00a34.5bn Airbus contract, to bring in new, lower-emitting aircraft.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nWill air travel get more expensive?\n\nAnalysis by US-based Dollar Flight Club, based on patterns after previous crises, predicts average fare falls of 35% through 2021, but for prices to then double by 2025.\n\nFlights will get cheaper as airlines desperately try to sell tickets \u2013 and then rise substantially as capacity falls, Charlton believes. \u201cIn the short term, the Ryanairs of this world are going to bomb the market with cheap seats to get revenues to survive. Others will try to match that and will collapse.\u201d Capacity will then fall and fares rise, as supply is squeezed.\n\nThe widespread industry consensus is that there will be fewer airlines as the industry consolidates via mergers, takeovers and bankruptcies. Iata has warned of mass insolvencies should the grounding persist beyond May. Already, airlines would have started summer schedules \u2013 meaning fuller, far more profitable flights. Instead, Iata said this week it now expects to lose more than half its annual revenues in 2020, a $314bn (\u00a3249bn) decline.\n\nStrickland says: \u201cAirlines are going to fall by the wayside.

The site scrapped its 5% platform fee in 2019, meaning it no longer takes a cut from donations, although it still charges card payment processing fees and takes money from Gift Aid.\n\nIt instead moved to a voluntary contribution model, set at a default 10% of the donation amount, which donors have to opt out of by selecting \u201cother\u201d in a list of drop-down options.\n\nThe site, which was bought by the US software company Blackbaud in 2017, was criticised for the platform fee it previously charged, particularly in the wake of high-profile appeals such as those for the Manchester bombing victims.\n\nThe voluntary contributions, which can be up to 15% of the donation amount, have saved charities \u00a320m in the last year, according to JustGiving.\n\n\u201cAdding a small contribution on top of your donation means we can continue to help more people,\u201d the appeal reads, with a pop-up information bar clarifying that \u201cit will be used to maintain the technology that keeps our site running 24/7\u201d and \u201cprovide top-notch customer service\u201d.\n\nPlay Video 8:07 How coronavirus changed the world in three months \u2013 video\n\nHowever, in December last year, the US financial consultancy Off Wall Street accused the platform of using \u201cmisleading language\u201d by suggesting the money would be reinvested to help charities, \u201cas if JustGiving were a non-profit entity\u201d.\n\nOff Wall Street estimated the new voluntary model earned JustGiving and Blackbaud \u00a37.5m per quarter, \u00a36m more a year than when it charged a 5% platform fee, The Times reported.\n\nIf donors contributing to half of Moore\u2019s total paid the default 10% of the donation amount, and those contributing to the other half paid nothing, JustGiving stood to make \u00a3750,000.\n\nBlackbaud announced that it would be adding \u00a3100,000 to Moore\u2019s fundraiser, the largest donation JustGiving has ever made to a cause.\n\nPayments processed through JustGiving for a UK charity via debit and credit card, and via PayPal, are subject to standard card processing fees of 1.9% plus 20p, and for donations made in foreign currency, this rises to 2.9% + 20p.\n\nIf a donation is eligible for Gift Aid, JustGiving said it claims the Gift Aid from HMRC and deducts a 5% processing fee before passing the remaining amount to the charity.\n\nIn contrast, Virgin Money Giving, another popular online platform for donating to charity, charges a 2% platform fee and 2.5% payment processing fee, which the donor can choose to cover.

We suspect that BAME individuals, including frontline and essential workers, are disproportionately exposed to this virus. If Public Health England has ethnic data on who\u2019s dying in hospital, they must release it. Only with transparency of data and quick action from all relevant agencies will we save lives.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s low-key announcement of an inquiry came after the head of the British Medical Association (BMA), Dr Chaand Nagpaul, gave an interview with the Guardian last week calling for an official investigation. He said: \u201cAt face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian understands that Public Health England is collating and analysing data on the ethnicity of patients who have died of Covid-19 in healthcare settings. However, it is not clear how long it will take to gather and publish the data.\n\nDr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cIf you\u2019re not disaggregating by ethnicity, that means we have no idea whether there is any racial disproportionality at all. If you don\u2019t ask the questions in data, then you don\u2019t have answers. If you don\u2019t measure it, then that problem doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nAsian and black patients are over-represented in critical care and account for a third of patients in hospital, despite making up a quarter of the population in the same areas. A study of 3,883 patients in critical care with Covid-19 from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre showed that BAME patients accounted for 33.6% of patients with the virus, despite accounting for just 14% of the population, according to the 2011 census.\n\nAsian patients make up 14.4% and black patients accounted for 11.9% of those in critical care units. However, when the figures are tallied against the local population, black patients are over-represented by a factor of two.\n\nThe BMA called for an inquiry based on the early critical care figures. More than a dozen healthcare workers from the Philippines have died from coronavirus in the UK. At least 23 people of Filipino origin are known to have died since the start of the outbreak.\n\nThe shadow equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, welcomed the review, but said it was \u201cnot yet clear whether it will be independent, when it will be concluded, and who will be leading it\u201d.\n\nRachel Logan, Amnesty UK\u2019s law and human rights programme director, said the government review was needed, but had to be transparent. \u201cThere\u2019s been much talk of how coronavirus is a \u2018great leveller\u2019, but these figures appear to show that some communities are suffering more than others,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is essential that the government ensure it is properly investigating why.\u201d\n\nResponding to the inquiry, Nagpaul said: \u201cWe are pleased that the government has heeded the BMA\u2019s call for this review. However, if the review is to have any meaningful impact, it needs to be informed with real-time data to understand why and how this deadly virus can have such a tragic disproportionate toll on our BAME communities and healthcare workers. This must include daily updates on ethnicity, circumstance and all protected characteristics of all patients in hospital as well as levels of illness in the community, which is not currently recorded.\n\n\u201cIt also means taking vital steps now to protect our BAME communities until we can develop a detailed understanding of the threats they face. This could include that those at greatest risk, including older and retired doctors, are not working in potentially infectious settings.\u201d\n\nYasmin Qureshi, MP for Bolton South-East, has also called on the government to release data about BAME deaths. Along with a group of 27 Labour MPs, she urged Matt Hancock, the health secretary, to examine why such a large number of BAME doctors were dying. \u201cWhen I became aware of these statistics I asked the Department of Health to explain,\u201d she said.\n\nEthnicity is not collected on death certificates in England and Wales, unlike in Scotland where it was added in 2012. This means that based on current mortality data it will not be possible to assess who has died from the virus outside hospitals.\n\nA spokesperson for the Office for National Statistics said work was underway to match data on Covid-19 deaths to other data sets to understand more about how ethnicity and deprivation are related to who is dying. However developing the new data is expected to take weeks, by which time it is anticipated the peak of the first wave of the virus will have passed.\n\nThe chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the intention of the inquiry was \u201cto look at this in some detail and then what we really want is, if we see any signal at all, we want to then know what next we can do about it to minimise risk\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by Sarah Marsh", "author": ["Caelainn Barr", "Haroon Siddique"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/16/government-ignores-uk-textiles-firms-desperate-to-make-ppe", "published": "2020-04-16T18:49:02", "title": "Government 'ignores' UK textiles firms desperate to make PPE", "text": "Too much emphasis placed on brand names to help during coronavirus crisis, say industry sources\n\nThe government has been too slow to enlist British textiles firms to make protective gear for the NHS, according to industry figures who say they have been desperate to contribute to the \u201cwar effort\u201d.\n\nFaced with a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), the Cabinet Office has only recently begun scrambling to source it from UK suppliers and has now outsourced the process to consultants from accountancy group Deloitte.\n\nIndustry figures said too much emphasis had been placed on high-profile names such as Burberry, the luxury fashion house that Matt Hancock said on 3 April was producing medical gowns.\n\nBurberry did not respond to queries from the Guardian about whether it has started producing gowns, and if so how many.\n\nKate Hills, the founder of Make It British, which promotes brands that manufacture in the UK, said the government was ignoring less well-known textile specialists in favour of household names that play well with the public.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just picking out brand names,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe people who can make this PPE are not well-known names, they are contract manufacturers behind the scenes.

Show Hide World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public. \u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated. There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces. Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers. Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.

The island has seen only 10 deaths out of a population of 5.6 million and its response has been celebrated as a model approach to the virus. Singapore used large-scale testing of citizens and a digital app \u2013 TraceTogether \u2013 to track the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 infection.\n\nBut technology is no panacea to the crisis. With just 12% of Singaporeans using the app, Mr Bay correctly observes the quality of data analysis is only as good as the quality of the data provided. \u201cFalse positives and false negatives have real-life (and death) consequences,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe use TraceTogether to supplement (manual) contact tracing \u2013 not replace it.\u201d\n\nIn the west the privacy challenges of smartphone apps are complex, and we must resist attempts to normalise any level of totalitarian surveillance. Yet the speed of the spread of the viral pathogen makes it difficult to see how such technology can be avoided. In such a system a person who develops symptoms and then, say, tests positive for Covid-19 lets his or her phone app know of their infection. This is then broadcast to every other app in the network which then searches their records to see if they have been close to the infected individual\u2019s phone since the time of infection. For this to work in the UK an app must hold data temporarily and anonymously, be installed at users\u2019 discretion, and have privacy at its core.\n\nBut this is only the first step. Until we develop a vaccine or a treatment, infections will have to be detected quickly, and infected individuals possibly quarantined. The bottom line is that to contain the epidemic and prevent another spike we will need an army of public health workers for ongoing testing and monitoring. How many would be needed? In Wuhan there were 81 public health officials for every 100,000 people. In New Zealand\u2019s success story \u2013 just nine deaths in a country of 5 million people \u2013 the comparable figure was four. But those low staffing levels can be maintained because New Zealand had the outbreak under better control and the islands\u2019 remoteness makes it easier to track visitors.\n\nA study for Johns Hopkins university in the US suggests that with Covid-19 circulating widely for many weeks, and without sufficient levels of testing, a region might need 15-30 public health workers per 100,000 people to bring the crisis under control. In the UK that would mean a new coronavirus workforce of 10,000-20,000 people to work in a system that Conservative governments since 2010 have starved of cash. We cannot allow tech evangelism to obscure the need to start funding, finding and training workers so the country can be kept safe.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/swab-tester-uk-germany-south-korea", "published": "2020-04-16T15:32:05", "title": "I am a swab tester \u2013 but we have barely any swabs to test | Gianmarco Raddi", "text": "We have donned our double gloves, face masks and eye shields \u2013 Covid-19\u2019s fashion essentials.

You can go home.\u201d It\u2019s midday. Our shift had only started at eight.\n\nMuch fanfare has been made of the need to scale up Covid-19 testing. But the truth is: the country\u2019s capacity to test for coronavirus is being wasted. Meanwhile, NHS workers are under-protected and under-tested. On Wednesday alone, more than 700 deaths were recorded in the UK due to Covid-19. One in five deaths are now linked to coronavirus. These numbers are dreadful, and yet they are likely to be an underestimate: the government\u2019s figures cover only hospital deaths, but new data revealed 521 Covid-19 deaths in the past few weeks in the care homes of two leading service providers. Strikingly, these firms account for only 3% of all care homes. The true death rate in the UK\u2019s care homes, and in the country overall, could be much higher.\n\nTesting is a crucial component of any public health response to an epidemic, and a key way to reduce deaths. And in UK laboratories, we now have the capacity to test tens of thousands of samples. Yet, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, recently suggested that the UK has not been increasing its testing capacity quickly enough. And Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, said Germany \u2013 which can now test more than 500,000 people a week \u2013 \u201cgot ahead\u201d in its ability to test for coronavirus. Indeed, statistics from the Department of Health show that while our cumulative deaths climbed from 4,900 on 5 April to almost 13,000 today, the number of tests carried out in the UK has stagnated at about 12,000.\n\nWhen health secretary Matt Hancock visited our Milton Keynes laboratory last Thursday, he avowed that our jobs were crucial, and thanked us for our service. Our workplace, where we test patient samples for the virus, has been called the \u201cbiggest diagnostic lab network in British history\u201d, with capacity to process more than 5,000 swabs, eventually projected to reach 30,000 swabs per day. And yet at our testing centre on Tuesday this week, we processed just over 1,000 samples. The day before, the total was 1,300, and three days ago 1,800.\n\nOur shifts were meant to be excruciating 12-hour marathons. In reality, they are rather more like laid-back morning jogs. Dozens of academics and laboratory personnel from all over the UK languish in a hotel with nothing to do. Millions of pounds of equipment borrowed from universities and companies rests silently in the evening hours, when the noise of our collective toil should be deafening.\n\nThe problem does not lie in the laboratories, or the personnel. The UK has an army of skilled researchers at its disposal. More than 1,200 scientists had volunteered their expertise in the fight against coronavirus in Cambridge alone by early April. Dozens signed up to help in Milton Keynes. The equipment and reagents are all available, now that Thermo Fisher Scientific has confirmed it will supply the UK with all the testing kits it needs. And \u201cscale up\u201d has been the mantra at Milton Keynes since I arrived last Monday. We were promised 5,000 samples \u201cto begin with\u201d. We never saw those numbers. They told us we should prepare for a 24-hour operation, but we are done in four or five.\n\nDisappointment abounds \u2013 and understandably so: all the staff, volunteers and managers have mobilised in an unprecedented manner for the mission. They created a world-class Covid-19 diagnostic centre from scratch in a couple of weeks, with precise protocols, standard operating procedures and training expertise to go with it. The tests are accurate, quality control checks are run daily and improvements constantly implemented. The lab continues to scale up and expand, with new robots and automated procedures coming online every day. The expertise and dedication of the frontline staff and management is truly commendable. It is proof of the excellence of the UK bioscience sector.\n\nSo, what is the problem? Where is the bottleneck? Maybe it is simply that fewer people were tested over the Easter weekend. But the virus does not respect holidays. Some days, we have been told that more than 4,000 swabs were offered, but people did not take advantage of them. Fine \u2013 but surely those swabs could be repurposed, and the spare capacity redirected? And even if test numbers do pick up today, or tomorrow, the rate of increase is far too slow for both the scale of this emergency and what our laboratories can handle\n\nWe are all being let down by a government that may have decided testing is, after all, not that important, despite the successful examples set by South Korea and Germany. On 12 April, the United States performed 140,000 tests. Italy more than 48,000. Turkey 35,000. Germany is averaging 50,000 a day. In the UK, total tests numbered just short of 16,000 on Tuesday.

For most of my adult life, I\u2019ve watched it decimate public services. My husband works in the social care sector, and my brother, who is severely autistic, is in the full-time care of the state. I am not alone in this: so many of us love someone who is reliant on the people working in our social care system or works in the system. We have long lamented the low pay and even lower respect afforded to care workers but until the coronavirus pandemic, few people listened.\n\nThe work of caring is long and arduous and often unglamorous. Care workers help my brother brush his teeth. They give him his bath, give him a shave, support him while he dresses, prepare his breakfast, help him use the toilet: all these vital things that he cannot do alone. But this is not all they do. Care work often involves highly specialised tasks, from hoisting and coping with seizures to the administration of medication.\n\nFurthermore, the emotional dimension of care work is often lost on people, but this is the most important part of the labour of caring. The work requires kindness, tact, tolerance, generosity, compassion and intelligence. Care workers afford my brother a dignity that the outside world often does not. They treat him as a human being, with interests and needs and desires, even if it means having to listen to Michael Bubl\u00e9 again in the car.\n\nThey comfort him when he cries because he misses us. They look after him when he has had a seizure and make him feel safe. They make playlists of his favourite music, draw up menu plans, come up with new activities to keep him occupied. They try to calm him down when he is angry or frustrated. Care workers are also often expected to tolerate aggression and abuse as a result of service users\u2019 behavioural problems or mental health issues. They are forced to be the recipients of racist views unleashed, for example, by dementia. Injuries happen.\n\nIt is difficult to put into words the gratitude I feel towards the people who do this job. Through this crisis, they are there. They are putting sleeping bags in the boots of their cars, in case they need to plug staff shortages. They are sleeping in caravans in the grounds of care homes, on air mattresses. In some homes, they are moving in en masse. As they face a rising death toll, they are helping people say goodbye to their loved ones. They fill their residents\u2019 rooms with mementos and photographs. They hold their hands when there is no one else to do so. Their commitment to vulnerable people goes above and beyond. It always has done, but now the country as a whole is realising it.\n\nGratitude is welcome. As Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, pointed out, we are clapping for our carers, which includes care workers as well as NHS staff. A badge that allows care workers to access essential services will be welcome, especially as some have been turned away from supermarkets. But, as others have so starkly highlighted, we must not forget that this crisis has been preceded by chronic underfunding. For 10 years, I have watched Conservative-led governments run down the services on which my family and millions of others are reliant. In the middle of all this, care workers have valiantly carried on, but there is a reason that there are 122,000 social care vacancies. To add to years of neglect, now some care workers have been forced to wear bin bags in the absence of proper protective equipment.\n\nBritain has a hidden coronavirus crisis \u2013 and it's shaped by inequality | Frances Ryan Read more\n\nThe last time I visited a pub, shortly before lockdown, I spent much of the evening talking to a care worker, a friend of a friend. She was having a tough time with the work. She was exhausted, strung out, disillusioned and depressed. She had recently started taking medication. People don\u2019t realise the toll it takes, she said; people don\u2019t realise how much we give of ourselves.\n\nI can\u2019t visit my brother at the moment, but I know that he is in good hands. I am scared, as we all are, and sad that I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll next be able to give him a hug. The men and women who look after him \u2013 many of them young \u2013 are putting their own health at risk to make sure he stays happy and well. Care workers are owed much more than a badge and our applause. They are owed decent pay and benefits, proper working conditions and employment rights. That is gratitude. That is caring.\n\n\u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist", "author": ["Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/number-coronavirus-pandemic", "published": "2020-04-16T07:00:00", "title": "No matter how you crunch the numbers, this pandemic is only just getting started | William Hanage", "text": "There has not been a lot of good news lately. But with the discharge of Boris Johnson from hospital on Sunday, and statements that the \u201cpeak\u201d strain on the National Health Service would be over the Easter period, you might be under the impression that the storm is passing, and the Covid-19 pandemic will soon be a memory.\n\nFueling this mood are reports from studies of communities already hit by the pandemic. At long last we are beginning to see the results of work looking for signs that people have already been infected, through the presence of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19. Some of this data suggests strongly that many infections may have passed unnoticed, with the only symptoms being mild things such as loss of the ability to smell and taste, and that as a result, more people may be immune than had been thought. Surely this is a sign that communities around the world can breathe a sigh of relief and start getting back to work?\n\nUnfortunately, it is nothing of the kind.\n\nTalk of the \u201cpeak\u201d can be misleading, because it\u2019s not clear whether you are talking about the Matterhorn or Table Mountain \u2013 both have a summit, but the peak is far more pronounced in one than the other. In countries such as Italy (unlike Wuhan) the initial surge in the Covid-19 pandemic has not evaporated quickly. There are multiple reasons for this but the most important is that the impact of physical distancing achieved in China has been hard to accomplish elsewhere, mostly because of the freedoms we correctly value in liberal democracies.\n\nWorse, there may be a mountain range. In other words, what is happening right now could be just one peak \u2013 not the peak. And the reason for this is that despite all those positive signs from antibody testing, the huge majority of the population is not immune.\n\nAn editorial in the British Medical Journal has reported data from China suggesting that as many as four in five cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection could be asymptomatic. It then goes on to quote people from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine in Oxford, who say that if this is true \u201cWhat the hell are we locking down for?\u201d I wish those people would be brave enough to go and repeat that opinion in an ER in the Bronx right now, in which actual medicine is going on. Worrying about the exact rate of asymptomatic infection, or the currently unknown duration of immunity and a possible \u201csecond wave\u201d, is like politely applauding the performance in a jazz club and murmuring \u201cnice\u201d while the building is demolished around you and the piano player gets decapitated.\n\nThere have been more than 93,000 cases of Covid-19 identified in the UK. Let\u2019s round that up and say it is 100,000. So if the reports from the BMJ editorial are accurate, the actual number would be that multiplied by five, in which case there would have already been half a million infections in the UK. If this really is the peak and we see as many cases on the way down as on the way up, that would total 1 million infections from the initial surge in the UK \u2013 hopefully all of those people would then be immune.\n\nThat would leave about 65 million people in the UK still without immunity.\n\nI am going to be unusually optimistic here, and assume that everyone who has Covid-19 becomes fully immune (not a given), and that the virus is towards the less transmissible end of the range of estimates currently available. If this is the case, you would need half your population to have been infected to achieve a level of population immunity that would stop the epidemic continuing to grow and overwhelming healthcare systems.\n\nAs I write the UK is reporting more than 10,000 deaths from Covid-19. Due to the realities of collecting data during an infectious disease emergency like this, that is likely to be an underestimate. Again, if we assume this is the peak and there is the same number on the way down that\u2019s 20,000 total from the initial surge. And to get to population immunity you have to multiply that by at least 30: based on the current data, that\u2019s about 600,000 deaths to get there, minimum.\n\nPlay Video 3:27 What the UK's coronavirus death toll is not telling us \u2013 video explainer\n\nFinding a vaccine to offer a complete solution to this pandemic is, even in the best scenarios, is still a long way off But it is not hard to see many ways we can slow the pace of the pandemic and save lives. One of them is greatly improved testing to identify cases and their contacts, which could be supplemented by clever digital methods to spot who has been at risk.\n\nGovernments around the world are attempting ways to keep jobs and businesses afloat while lockdowns are in place \u2013 but the pressure remains to swiftly end such shutdowns. I get that this is going to be a mammoth strain on the economy. But the deaths of many thousands of people would be too: it is simply not possible to thoroughly insulate an economy from the impact of a pandemic of this kind.\n\nWhere I live, in Cambridge Massachusetts, I keep hearing sirens. This crisis is not close to over, quite the reverse.

There does seem to be a real swell of support from people to do this.\u201d\n\nShe said workers who had been furloughed were allowed to top up their income through farm work, and many others who had lost their jobs would see it as a lifeline, as well as a way to help the country through the coronavirus crisis.\n\nWorkers have been flown in this week on charter flights from Romania, despite travel restrictions and fears for their health and safety. Germany has also been recruiting farm workers by air from eastern Europe. About 80,000 workers are likely to be needed this year, leading to calls for a \u201cland army\u201d of paid workers to join farms.\n\nBatters said there was still time for more people to sign up, as the critical period for the UK\u2019s harvest would not begin until next month. \u201cWe will know much more when we get to May,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, even if the labour shortages are less severe than some have predicted, farmers across the country are still facing a struggle to stay in business as their supply chains have been turned upside down by the coronavirus crisis.\n\nScottish fruit farmers recruit thousands of locals to save harvest Read more\n\nFor farmers, the biggest single problem is that before the lockdown about half of the food consumed in the UK was eaten outside the home, in cafes, restaurants and pubs. Now they are closed, supermarkets are struggling to keep up with demand for grocery shopping, but farmers used to supplying the catering trade have few ways of getting their produce to consumers. \u201cIt is very difficult, if not impossible, to switch,\u201d said Batters.\n\nFood must meet different standards when sold through supermarkets, and adapting the supply chain takes longer than farmers have to sell their perishable produce. \u201cIf you\u2019re a potato farmer, and you sold to fish and chip shops, you can\u2019t just start selling your produce direct. You can sell some at the end of the farm drive, but that\u2019s only going to make a small difference,\u201d said Batters.\n\nMinisters have been slow to act, said Martin Lines, chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network. \u201cWe have heard very little from the government on how they will be supporting farmers to effectively make this transition and we urge them to look at appropriate ways to deliver a clear food delivery strategy that supports short, sustainable supply chains during the pandemic and beyond,\u201d he said.\n\nSelling directly to consumers remains difficult, even for farmers who have set up their business that way. Charlie Cole, a livestock farmer at Broughgammon farm in Northern Ireland, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute nightmare. Our business is completely dependent on us selling directly to the customer. So now that the government restrictions are in place, the farmers\u2019 markets and street food events have come to a close and we\u2019ve had to shut the cafe in the farm shop, which are all usually reliable sources of income.\u201d\n\nThe cancellation of Wimbledon means its strawberry supplier in Kent is faced with 33 tonnes of perishable soft fruit with no market. Marion Regan, whose great-grandfather established Hugh Lowe Farms in Kent in 1893 with a Covent Garden stall, is now looking at alternatives. \u201cWe will find a home for them,\u201d she told the Oxford Farming Conference podcast. She said she was talking to food banks as well as commercial outlets.\n\nThe difference between what we eat at home and our tastes when eating out is also causing problems. Our love of mince is a menace to livestock farmers, who have seen the meat market collapse even while supermarkets have been stocking their shelves with meat imported from Poland. People are eating far more mince, which is cheap and comes from the tougher end of the animal, instead of the more expensive cuts, such as steak, that we tend to choose when eating out.\n\nAs farmers need to sell whole carcasses, they are forced to sell at far below the true value. \u201cIf everyone wants mince, the carcass is massively devalued,\u201d said Batters. \u201cPeople want to buy British beef. If it has to be mince, OK, but you must balance the carcass [if necessary by mincing prime cuts] and stabilise the price, or people will go out of business.\u201d\n\nCoffee shops used to account for a large proportion of the UK\u2019s fresh milk sales, but when drinking at home people tend not to make the milky cappuccinos and lattes that they would buy when out.

The trend was particularly marked in the past 30 years.\n\nThe research was conducted by Dr Sam Friedman, an associate professor at the department of sociology at the London School of Economics, and Dr Aaron Reeves, a senior research fellow at Oxford University\u2019s department of social policy and intervention. They found elites were more recently adopting a blend of the highbrow and ordinary, suggesting an attempt to find commonality with the rest of the population, while still signifying their eliteness.\n\nIt was most clear from the 1990s onwards, said Friedman, \u201ccoinciding neatly with the continuing rise of the top 1%. Of course, this is only an association. Yet, we would speculate that these patterns may be connected.\n\n\u201cPut simply, as elites have pulled away economically, there is mounting evidence that they are increasingly insecure about their moral legitimacy, and increasingly sensitive to public concern they are snobbish, self-interested and out of touch.\u201d\n\nHow elites presented their cultural lives had become a key PR battleground, he said. \u201cPerforming ordinariness may provide a very effective means of shoring up authenticity in an era of rising inequality.\u201d\n\nFriedman likened it to Boris Johnson declaring his hobby of making model buses during last year\u2019s Conservative leadership campaign, \u201cwhen he actually enjoys incredibly highbrow painting and Greek literature\u201d, which he chose not to talk about.\n\nReeves said it mattered what people played on Desert Island Discs, which was an even more public performance of cultural identity. \u201cTony Blair famously convened a focus group \u2013 as he did for many things \u2013 to help him calculate what to play,\u201d he said.\n\nExamining Who\u2019s Who, researchers found three distinct historical periods. In the 19th century, landed gentry pursuits of hunting, shooting, polo and sailing were common, influenced by the \u201cseason\u201d in the elite social calendar.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, as \u201cnouveau riche\u201d industrialists infiltrated high society, the elite turned to London-centric theatre, ballet, classical music, literature and opera, influenced in particular by the Bloomsbury Group, which included figures such as Virginia Woolf.\n\nThe third phase began in the 1950s, when the art world legitimised popular cultural forms, alongside a generational decline in snobbery and deference, Friedman and Reeves said in their paper. That phase first reveals a rise in entries mentioning football, cinema, and mundane practices like spending time with family, friends and pets.\n\nReeves said: \u201cThe move towards mundane and everyday leisure pursuits doesn\u2019t necessarily mean elites are actually becoming ordinary, of course.\u201dMore, it revealed how they wished to present themselves. Researchers found traditional aristocratic recreations, like horse-riding and polo, were still mentioned alongside the more commonplace.\n\nElites were, perhaps, trying to forge a sense of commonality and connection, added Friedman. \u201cAnd the way they do that is to try to cultivate a cultural profile that they feel looks like the \u2018everyman\u2019.\u201d There was also a trend towards humour in listings, for example, \u201cloud music, strong cider\u201d.\n\nWho\u2019s Who, which has been published annually since 1849, was an \u201cunrivalled\u201d record from which to analyse how elites signalled their superior social position via the consumption of culture, the research states.\n\nJust 0.05% of the UK population was featured. Part of its appeal was its understanding of eliteness as not necessarily confined to the landed or wealthy. Half of entrants are included automatically on attaining prominent public positions, such as MPs, peers, FTSE 100 chief executives.

As Carrie Mathison, the CIA operative turned private contractor turned non-profit worker turned presidential adviser turned gulag prisoner at the center of the series, Claire Danes has put an expressive face on America\u2019s deeply flawed, ethically dubious intervention in the Middle East. But for the final season, which wraps up this month, the producers wanted to de-sensationalize and get back to the hard facts.\n\nThe Innocence Files: a shocking Netflix series on wrongful convictions Read more\n\nThat\u2019s when Greg Barker got the call that would ultimately result in The Longest War, his new documentary airing this Sunday night on Showtime, in anticipation of the finale. \u201cThe executive producers of Homeland do this deep dive in Washington every year, talking to policymakers about whatever the next season\u2019s themes will be,\u201d Barker tells the Guardian. \u201cIn the course of doing that, [executive producers] Alex [Gansa] and Howard [Gordon] were stunned by the stories they were hearing about the war in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nGansa and Gordon went to Showtime and inquired about the possibility of putting together a companion report of sorts, to complement their last batch of new episodes. The top brass knew to approach Barker, who has established himself as a seasoned pro with a string of issue-driven films from the frontlines of US foreign policy. \u201cI\u2019ve got experience in that world,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ve been to Afghanistan. I\u2019ve got a good partnership with [national security journalist] Peter Bergen, his wife and professional partner Tresha Mabile, who both know this world intimately as well. I said I\u2019d definitely do it, and the project came out of the discussions about what the last season of Homeland would be.\u201d\n\nBarker zeroed in on America\u2019s presence in Afghanistan, a disorganized campaign stretching back several decades to Carter\u2019s administration in the 80s, as what he calls an \u201cagency war\u201d. Through the many presidencies spanning both political parties, the war\u2019s constant has been the CIA\u2019s string-pulling out of sight. \u201cThe agency has taken the lead on this war all the way through,\u201d Barker says, \u201ccertainly in terms of its origins, which go back to the CIA efforts against the Soviets and the immediate aftermath of 9/11.\u201d He assembles a clear timeline tracing the agency\u2019s dysfunction from the headquarters in Langley to their base in Kabul, as ulterior motives and mission creep \u2013 memorably amended by one soundbite to \u201cmission fantasy\u201d \u2013 extend and worsen a single, unbroken war.\n\nNaturally, Barker\u2019s work of arranging and organizing information wasn\u2019t as simple as reciting that chronology as it stands today. \u201cIt was a fast turnaround,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe started production in November. I had a massive team and a lot of help, but with something like that, we had to know what we were doing from the outset. Normally, in documentaries, you might have a year or more in the editing room alone, which leaves time to try out different structures. We did not have that. I said, \u2018Look, we\u2019ll divide it up into eight chapters.\u2019 War against the Soviets, pre-9/11, post-9/11, real broad strokes. My goal was not to tell a comprehensive history, but to give a general overview of the emotional journey in this war. We had to stick to that structure, which luckily worked out in the end.\u201d\n\nThe hasty production schedule dictated that Barker and his team would rely primarily on interviews and archival materials, in a departure from his more \u201cexperimental and granular\u201d work. Barker and his close collaborators Bergen and Mabile came in knowing they wouldn\u2019t have the latitude to do a \u201cfull-bore investigative\u201d approach, but they managed to break new ground all the same. They gained access to some authorities who had never before gone on record, such as the recently retired CIA officer Lisa Maddox, who provides a sobering inside take on the subject. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how this ends,\u201d she says quietly, in one of the documentary\u2019s talking-head segments.\n\nMaddox\u2019s contributions underscore one of the key aspects of Barker\u2019s portrayal: that this has been an across-the-aisle effort kept active through endorsements from generations of politicians. While his work touches on highly sensitive national themes, he refrains from side-taking. \u201cI think Afghanistan is one of those wars where it\u2019s not helpful to look at it through a partisan lens. It\u2019s more helpful to think of it as institutional. It shows, for me, what happens when you lose your focus in foreign relations. A couple times, it was clear what the war was about: we\u2019re going to depose the Soviets, we\u2019re going to get Bin Laden. But for the many years in between, there was no focus in Washington while people were thinking of other things.\u201c\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Breshna Musazai in The Longest War. Photograph: Courtesy of Showtime\n\nHe continues: \u201cObama, had he wanted to find a way to get out of Afghanistan, could have found a way out. The CIA needed the drone bases there too badly. It\u2019s been tough to pull out. I think Trump wants to, though his policy stances don\u2019t always hold up to analysis.\u201d\n\nIn the film and the interview, Barker conveys his major bullet points in overarching terms, more crash course than college course. Showtime tasked him with covering a lot of ground in a compact allotment of time, which forced him to rethink the minutiae-oriented methods he bred back at Frontline at PBS. \u201cMost storytelling, narrative or non-fiction, is a matter of knowing what to leave out,\u201d he explains. \u201cHow much exposition is necessary? Particularly in talking about Afghanistan, which could fill an entire encyclopedia. I estimate that for an audience watching a 90-minute documentary, they might walk away remembering half a dozen moments. They\u2019ll recall those moments more clearly when they\u2019re grounded in emotion that can come back to you.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s dead-on about the potency that a little bit of sentiment can wield in a work chiefly designed to educate. Discussing war lends itself to a focus on dates, figures and concepts, but the elusive human element ties Barker\u2019s film together. He selects footage emphasizing that this shouldn\u2019t be seen as some vague history, but rather a recollection of real things that happened to real people not so long ago.\n\n\u201cPeter and Tresha and I felt strongly about including Afghan voices in this film, so Peter went to Afghanistan in December, he had some contacts. It\u2019s important to remember that all policy has a human face. Real people around the world suffer the consequences that people make on paper, in theory, in the abstract.\u201d\n\nIn both The Longest War and Barker\u2019s other upcoming project \u2013 his first narrative film, a biopic of the UN diplomat S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello due on Netflix this weekend \u2013 he puts globally scaled events in terms of the personal toll they exact. Having spent the first 85 minutes of The Longest War confronting his audience with troubling patterns of international negligence, Barker concludes on an optimistic note. He turns his camera on Afghan university scholars, fantasizing about the brighter future they might bring to their country. The moment lands as a rejoinder to Maddox\u2019s learned hopelessness, a declaration that so long as decent people continue making the effort, war cannot extinguish the promise of a better tomorrow\n\n\u201cAt the end of the film, those university students who still want to graduate and return to their country after surviving a terrorist attack \u2013 that\u2019s the endurance of the human spirit I want to leave viewers with,\u201d Barker says. \u201cThere\u2019s a way out of the darkness.

I think the situation brought out a new side in us. There\u2019s a tendency for everyone to be constantly joking, but it forced us to be more considerate and open.

I wouldn\u2019t be able to record an album like [Jones\u2019s 2018 release] Starting Today because that requires me to be in a room with a lot of musicians, playing together. That can\u2019t really happen at the moment, and that upsets me. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how lockdown affects UK jazz. A lot of music is created for dancefloors \u2013 that music is going to change probably. If the lockdown goes on long enough, music will naturally adapt to the setting that people are in.

When I first came out and I was trying to be a woman and exist in public spaces, the only places I got validation for who I was, at first, were within the very small dance music community. So if the only people who use correct pronouns and see your struggle in this world are the people that you\u2019re connected to through music and then you\u2019re isolated, no one is creating that support system around you for who you are. It can get dark.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve been doing livestreams from our backyard. We\u2019re trying to do one thing a week to give people some access to music and community. We\u2019ve done DJing guides, and we want to start a conference to discuss them. Maya and I have been joking about starting a synth-pop band. But we do so much together, it\u2019s important to go it alone sometimes.\n\nOcto Octa (Maya Bouldry-Morrison): It\u2019s hard to say that isolating is nice, but I am happy to be here. We work as a unit pretty often. When Eris and I are on the road, we\u2019re attached at the hip. There is a lot of melding of personalities and becoming one person, in a certain sense, when you\u2019re having to travel together, play together, and that somewhat carries over to home. But we have two different studios in the house, so we work on music separately, and then Brooke does visual art.\n\nWhen we first came home from tour, I got a bunch of stuff done really quickly. I put out a mixtape; I put some finishing touches on an EP. And then my motivation kind of started dipping.

The only problem is in the morning when everyone wants to shower. People in bands are suited to being in isolation because they spend days in cramped spaces without doing much exercise. We\u2019re lucky, because we were meant to be writing a debut album anyway, and being stuck in quarantine with your band means that you don\u2019t have any other option but to do it. We weren\u2019t in the best financial position, so we applied for the Help Musicians\u2019 Coronavirus Hardship Fund, and that\u2019s been a massive help.

For every other appearance fronting up the daily Downing Street press briefing, we\u2019ve had the Colonel Kurtz foreign secretary. The full-on madman with vein throbbing in his forehead. Ready to mix it with his own shadow and now so far gone he was almost longing for the police to arrest him.\n\nNow, though, Dom was a great deal more chilled. Even to the point of being totally boring. He could make a more than acceptable de facto prime minister yet. It\u2019s amazing what a 7% solution of beta blockers and Mogadon can achieve. From tense and nervous and I-can\u2019t-relax psycho killer to suburban Rotarian in one very slow heartbeat. No need for anyone to run, run, run, run, run, run, run away. This was Raab as the chartered surveyor who had received a series of unexpected promotions simply by turning down every project as being too risky. That way, he would never get to be proved wrong. Dom: the Man who likes to say \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThere again, Raab had managed to slow down both his metabolism and his thought processes so much that he was now actually at least seven days behind the rest of the country. On the plus side, he\u2019s still got a sunny Easter weekend to look forward to. It\u2019s been evident to anyone with the hint of a pulse for over a week now that there was no chance of the government lifting any of its lockdown measures anytime soon. You\u2019ve only had to see the daily fatality figures to know that. But Dom still managed to make the announcement as if it was breaking news. Perhaps it was to him.\n\nMind you, Raab did hedge his bets a bit by saying that the restrictions would initially remain in place for another three weeks. It sounded as if he was hoping the prime minister might be back in action by then, so that it would be Boris Johnson and not him who would have to break it to a stir-crazy nation that the three weeks might then turn into another three weeks. And then another three weeks after that.\n\nClearly the government believes the country can only take three weeks of bad news at any one time. Shame Boris rather gave the game away last month by saying the quarantine could last three months. No one should be making too many plans for before the end of June at the earliest.\n\nThe foreign secretary had also cannily taken a leaf out of Matt Hancock\u2019s book. Two weeks ago the secretary for health and social care \u2013 that\u2019s the bit he tends to forget about and gets tacked on as an afterthought \u2013 had grandly announced his \u201cFive Pillars\u201d for the NHS that sounded authoritative and had gone down well with the public. Even though no one \u2013 not even Tigger \u2013 could any longer remember what any of those five pillars had been.\n\nSo Dom decided to go big, think outside of the box even, by coming up with his Five Tests that would determine the basis on which the government would consider easing restrictions. Information that had hitherto been considered so top secret that neither Rishi Sunak nor Hancock had been able to share it with the nation when asked at press conferences earlier in the week. So here was Raab, playing it straight and looking the country directly in the eyes. Even if his own were half closed due to the near lethal cocktail of drugs he had injected half an hour earlier.\n\nFirst, things would have to get a bit better in some areas. Second, things would have to get a bit better in other areas. Tests three, four and five followed along similar lines. The Five Tests were literally what anyone could have worked out for themselves. At another time, it might have been a worry that it had taken the cabinet so long to state the obvious. But nowadays we have become accustomed to have \u201cbeing dim\u201d and \u201cslow react\u201d priced in to every government decisions.\n\nThe briefing had always been meant to be dull and matter-of-fact, to lure everyone into a state of narcolepsy. But realising it had been rather flatter and more depressing than intended and that there were still no answers as to why Germany and South Korea appeared to be handling the crisis so much better, Raab belatedly tried to find a few positives. The health secretary had finally remembered care homes existed and was going to get each and every one of them to pay for a shiny, superhero Green Badge that could instantly repel the coronavirus.\n\nTowards the end, Raab became slightly punchier as the drugs wore off. Though he couldn\u2019t bring himself to wholly defend the World Health Organization \u2013 he might get ticked off by Donald Trump or Boris if he did \u2013 he did say that the UK might have to rethink its relationship with China once the crisis was over.\n\nThis on the same day the prime minister\u2019s press spokesman had said the UK would be better off dealing with the pandemic without being held back by EU regulations. Hell, if he felt like that why not go the whole hog and scrub the facade of the trade negotiations and end transition now. Fantastic. The UK\u2019s answer to a global catastrophe was to go it alone.

But as everyone from Giorgione to Van Gogh can attest, separation from society can do wonders for the creative mind\n\nWhat\u2019s a street artist to do when the streets are locked down? Banksy\u2019s got nothing to keep him busy except create mayhem in his own bathroom. He has released photographs of what he says is his loo decorated with stencilled rats in a trompe l\u2019oeil rodent rampage \u2013 swinging from the towel holder, balancing on a mirror frame, perching on a toilet splashed with orangey-brown matter.\n\nFor these filthy beasts long associated with plague, coronavirus means party time. They are celebrating our decline and fall. Maybe Banksy sees the anarchic potential in a world that has decided to suspend normal business.\n\nPhotograph: Banksy/PA\n\nIs there something about being isolated that releases the best in artists? David Hockney shares paintings of resurgent nature, Tracey Emin confesses her fears and now Banksy reveals the surreal side of spending too much time at home. Isolationism \u2013 to pin a label on these various responses to a shared crisis \u2013 is a new kind of art because this is a new kind of crisis. But artists have been isolated before, and what they produced confirms that being separated from society can do wonders for the creative mind.\n\nArtists were quarantined for illness as early as the Renaissance, when Italian cities pioneered social distancing measures as they struggled with plague. The Venetian painter Giorgione died on the lagoon city\u2019s quarantine island Lazaretto Nuovo in 1510. According to his biographer Vasari, he chose to isolate alongside his infected lover and caught the fatal illness. On this island of socially excluded dying people, he may have created his most famous masterpiece, the Sleeping Venus. As Giorgione and his lover lay sick and isolated, he made this one last painting of her. She\u2019s not just sleeping \u2013 she\u2019s dying or dead. And as she lies there he records his love. (He doesn\u2019t show the buboes, of course.)\n\nThe illnesses that have usually led to the isolation of great artists, however, are mental rather than physical. Richard Dadd spent most of his adult life in the closed hospitals of Bedlam and Broadmoor after he murdered his father, who he believed was the devil. Dadd\u2019s doctors encouraged his art even though he never recovered. He painted strange, intense portraits of his carers as well as fantastically detailed scenes of fairy life. Freedom was an escape into microscopically precise visions of tiny demonic beings. Thinking about his painting The Fairy-Feller\u2019s Master-Stroke, I\u2019m starting to worry about Banksy. His rampaging rats are not so different from these deliriously anarchic Victorian fairies.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dying creation ... Giorgione\u2019s Sleeping Venus. Photograph: Archivart/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nVincent van Gogh accepted that he needed to be confined after he cut off his earlobe and was hounded as a \u201cmadman\u201d by the people of Arles. He was locked up for a year in the Saint-Paul Asylum at Saint-Remy. While there, he positively thrived as an artist. He fixed his eyes on the asylum garden, its yellow corridors, its lonely patients. It was while looking out of his window in the asylum that he painted his ecstatic vision of cosmic glory The Starry Night. Vincent killed himself three months after leaving the asylum. He might have been better off staying there.\n\nVan Gogh helped inspire the 20th-century cult of \u201coutsider art\u201d or art Brut, which sought out and recognised the works made by asylum patients. Jean Dubuffet, apostle of art brut, promoted the work of Swiss asylum patient Alo\u00efse Corbaz. Her swirling orange and blue fantasies have some of the electricity of The Starry Night.\n\nOther artists have chosen to self-isolate of their own free will. The great abstract painter Agnes Martin got so sick of the noise of the New York art world that she fled in 1967 to a life of solitude, living in a series of adobe dwellings she built for herself in the New Mexico desert. Her absorbing networks of ethereal marks in fields of whiteness are monuments to the peace and silence she found in her wilderness retreat. In a way she was imitating earlier women artists who lived in confinement as nuns. The Renaissance artist Plautilla Nelli spent her life in a convent in Siena but won widespread recognition.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ecstatic vision ... Vincent van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\n\nArt itself is torn between the social and the isolated. It is all about communicating with others, yet the best art is introspective. Even Banksy, whose art is nothing if not social, has been driven to his own kind of introspection: Rats! Rats! I can see rats! Then again, he chooses to be anonymous so perhaps he\u2019s a shy person at heart.\n\nThere\u2019s something tragicomic about trying to see the bright side of coronavirus. Isolation does, however, seem to be releasing modern art\u2019s inner hermit. Far from the madding crowds of fairs and biennials, artists are rediscovering the solitary springs of creativity.", "author": ["Jonathan Jones"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-lockdown-friendship-understanding-sausage", "published": "2020-04-16T11:00:06", "title": "What we need now is friendship and understanding. And a bit of sausage | Jay Rayner", "text": "It is mid-morning on day whatever of this lockdown, and I\u2019m doing what I need to do to be me. I am standing in front of the open fridge, surveying the contents, which sprawl across each other like donated shoes at a jumble sale. Plates of leftovers perch on top of each other, a function of catering each night as if, come the morning, an invading army will be pillaging the land. I spot a couple of cooked sausages, the cheap ones made with less loin, and more nostril, lip and nipple because one of my family members likes those and right now, we all get what we damn well like. I tear off a solid inch of cold, cheap fried sausage. I pop it into my mouth, slam the fridge door shut and move on. Nothing to see here. I delight in the way my teeth crack through the taut artificial skin to the heat-set, unnaturally pink, salty protein inside.\n\nI have never met a tiny, crusty bit of indeterminate something on the bottom of a roast-chicken tin that I didn\u2019t adore\n\nJudge me at your peril. As far as I am concerned, the only way through all this lies in a mixed emotional economy. Yes, we need friendship and compromise; selflessness, understanding and a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc at day\u2019s end. But an inch of cheap sausage also has a part to play. Of course there are grand, intricate cooking projects to give our days texture; one morning I discovered I was fortunate to have, hidden in the freezer, some chunky pork ribs. In total I spent six hours searing, braising, glazing and grilling them. It was a perfect distraction, with dinner to finish.\n\nBut where food is concerned, I have concluded that making it through the days also demands taking joy in the very smallest of things. They are the florid punctuation marks across aching expanses of untextured time. There are the obvious ones like stopping to sniff the newly opened pack of coffee, which we know smells better than the coffee ever tastes, but we must all of us learn to live in the moment. Then there are those which are more personal. I love running my finger along the flat of a knife at the end of breakfast to gather up the leftover smears of butter and Marmite and perhaps the odd toasted crumb for texture. I try to do this unwitnessed because I don\u2019t have the energy to deal with other people\u2019s ill-formed judgments.\n\nIf I told you I was capable of stopping at the cupboard to take a neat teaspoonful of crunchy peanut butter you would think less of me. So I won\u2019t tell you that. Instead I\u2019ll tell you that, occasionally, I might return to the fridge, find the piece of stilton we keep for blue cheese emergencies and crumble off the smallest of pieces between thumb and forefinger, just to get the tiny flavour hit.\n\nIn the same way, I love the fragments of vinegared spring onion that get left in the emptied salad bowl. I have also never met a tiny, crusty bit of indeterminate something \u2013 baked blood? Incinerated dairy solids? \u2013 caked to the bottom of the tin after a chicken has been roasted in it that I didn\u2019t adore. See also the brown crunchy stuff in the pan after frying bacon. Mind not to burn your fingertips, though let\u2019s be honest: the pain is worth it.\n\nI am aware that these confessions display a pronounced lack of shame. Well, innocent as charged. Because, in a pandemic lockdown, when your family has become your social life, the world is literally too small and enclosed for feeling shame about things which aren\u2019t shameful. Weird is not the same as wrong, and we all need to find our joy where we can. If I find mine in a nugget of cold, cheap sausage I think that\u2019s OK.\n\n\n\n", "author": ["Jay Rayner"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/16/steph-mcgovern-the-steph-show-tv-presenter-at-home-broadcast", "published": "2020-04-16T12:30:07", "title": "'Keeping the house tidy is the big thing': Steph McGovern on making a TV show at home", "text": "With baby banished to the bedroom and a lawnful of TV equipment, The Steph Show presenter fears the programme might go on being broadcast from her house for ever\n\nChannel 4 had grand plans for The Steph Show. Scheduled to launch in mid-spring, it was set to be the keystone of the channel\u2019s daytime schedules \u2013 a bright, buzzy magazine show fronted by rising star Steph McGovern, newly freed from the clutches of the BBC. Shot live from a prime slab of Leeds waterside real estate before a lively studio audience, The Steph Show was gearing up to breathe life into the channel\u2019s fusty daytime output. And then the coronavirus happened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just at Asda,\u201d McGovern tells me over Zoom. \u201cI had to queue for 45 minutes to get in.\u201d She finished recording her ninth episode three hours ago, and has come straight from the studio to buy baby milk for her five-month-old daughter. And when she\u2019s finished, she will head straight back to the studio to feed her. Because things have changed, and now she hosts The Steph Show from her house.\n\nIn what sounds like an incredibly frantic few days last month, Channel 4 scrapped its original plans for The Steph Show, brought the launch date forward by three weeks and decided to film it in McGovern\u2019s ground floor. An engineer visited her house for a feasibility assessment. Cameras were hooked up on fixed rigs around her house. Satellite trucks positioned themselves on her lawn. She filmed a trailer, holding up placards Bob Dylan-style from behind a window. They rehearsed on Sunday. The next day, the first show aired.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Producer\u2019s eye view ... multiple camera views of the Steph Show in progress around McGovern\u2019s house. Photograph: Channel 4\n\n\u201cIt was incredibly fast, but everyone wanted to get it on air. It was one of those things where we\u2019re all in it together,\u201d McGovern says. \u201cI mean, the lawn is going to be wrecked,\u201d she adds ruefully.\n\nIncredibly, the show works. McGovern wanders around her house (more of which later), chatting to celebrity guests over Skype, checking in on families who are attempting to adjust to the new situation and finding experts to discuss the practicalities of life under lockdown. Last week, she attempted a cookery segment, with the Cold Feet star Fay Ripley bravely attempting to instruct her remotely on how to make mac and cheese. McGovern botched it, but kept returning to the dish to grab a mouthful over the course of the next few minutes, the same way you or I might. For anyone stuck by themselves at the moment, it must feel like dropping in on an old friend.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how we wanted it to feel\u201d, says Channel 4\u2019s head of daytime, Jo Street, whose decision it was to bring the series forward. \u201cSteph does feel like an everywoman. She\u2019s the girl you want to have a beer with, or go for a coffee with, or be mates with. For a massive part of our audience, that is the job that she\u2019s doing every lunchtime.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s hard to see how this would work had anyone else been in the driving seat. If a big name had presented a daytime show from their imposingly large house, viewers would have been instantly alienated. But McGovern\u2019s house, although beautifully designed \u2013 her integrated kitchen banquette has already become something of a national talking point \u2013 is basically a normal-sized family house. The living room, dining room and kitchen are all essentially the same thing, and you could probably walk from one end to the other in less than 10 seconds. Her partner and baby have to hide in a bedroom during the broadcast. McGovern says that her daughter \u201ctends to sleep through the show. That\u2019s how much she cares about it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest McGovern interviewing the comedian Jason Manford on The Steph Show last week. Photograph: Channel 4/PA\n\nThe main thing, she\u2019s finding, is locating the balance between family home and television studio. \u201cKeeping it tidy is the big thing,\u201d McGovern says. \u201cA lot of viewers have said to me: \u2018How come your house is so clean?\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018Because it\u2019s on telly.\u2019 I\u2019ve got a bit of a routine of an evening. We have our dinner and then, once everyone goes to bed, I just whizz around and try and sort it out. We have a deal. My partner does the cooking and I do all the tidying.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, despite all this, there\u2019s more to McGovern than her everywoman persona would suggest. Before being poached by Channel 4, she had been BBC Breakfast\u2019s lead business presenter for a decade. Before that she was a producer, in charge of the business news for the BBC\u2019s one, six and 10 o\u2019clock bulletins. At the age of 19, during an apprenticeship with Black & Decker, she devised a new production technique that saved the company \u00a3150,000 a year. When Have I Got News For You decided to continue filming remotely without an audience, she was the first choice to host. In short, she knows her stuff. And this extends to her plans for the direction of The Steph Show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that I want real people to be the focus of it, and that\u2019s what I want to keep driving through,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, it\u2019s lovely to have some celebrities on, but, for me, what\u2019s better are people like the blood biker volunteers we had on yesterday. Or the 14-year-old girl who lost her hands when she was a baby and can now play piano because she learned it in lockdown. I know it sounds cheesy, but that\u2019s what I think is going to make this show good.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic service broadcasting is not just news and current affairs,\u201d adds Street. \u201cIt\u2019s about connecting to an audience when they need you. Steph was really passionate about that.\u201d\n\nIt all sounds lovely, but these are uncertain times. Without wanting to get any darker than necessary, I have to ask McGovern about contingencies. Her show is called The Steph Show. It\u2019s filmed from her house. Hopefully it won\u2019t, but what would happen if she finds herself becoming ill?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A production team member works in a van outside McGovern\u2019s house. Photograph: Channel 4\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see if Stephanie Cole is available,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cDo you know what? Nobody has an answer to that. I have not got a clue what we would do. If I wasn\u2019t too ill, then I would like to think I would try to carry on in some capacity. If I got really ill, someone else could do it. I\u2019m not precious about it. Johnny Vegas seems to be appearing a lot. I might ask him if he could.\u201d\n\nSo successful is The Steph Show in this new form, in fact, that I wonder whether this is perhaps how it should always be. Broadcasting from her home gives the show such a ramshackle and intimate quality that it already feels as if the show\u2019s voice has been found. Has anyone considered abandoning the studio and carrying on like this after the lockdown lifts?\n\n\u201cYes. Sure,\u201d scolds Jo Street, sarcastically. \u201cBecause this is such an easy way to make a television programme.\u201d McGovern also admits that continuing like this for ever is her \u201cbiggest fear\u201d, but then adds that the current set-up is bound to inform the show when it is broadcast as intended. \u201cOr maybe I could just recreate my entire house inside the studio,\u201d she ponders. \u201cI might just go full-on Alan Partridge.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Steph Show, weekdays, 12pm, Channel 4", "author": ["Stuart Heritage"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/16/hydroxychloroquine-how-did-an-unproven-drug-become-trumps-miracle-cure", "published": "2020-04-16T02:00:31", "title": "The story behind Trump's 'miracle' drug hydroxychloroquine \u2013 podcast", "text": "The drug has been used to treat a number of diseases in the past half-century but after a French study claimed it was effective against coronavirus it has been hailed by the US president as a cure.

The very thought of it is completely ruining my lockdown | Joel Golby", "text": "Ah, I see we\u2019re at the \u201cpoliticising soup\u201d part of the lockdown discourse. That\u2019s good. We\u2019re ahead of schedule: I thought it would be weeks before I would read bizarre puff pieces about the restorative powers of broth in the face of a coronavirus pandemic that the NHS is desperately firefighting with actual medicine, but no. I was naive, and wrong, and now \u201cBoris Broth\u201d is here, conjuring up images of Boris Johnson poaching pinkly in a hot bath before ladling the water off into a stockpot, and ruining my lockdown for ever.\n\nWhat is Boris Broth? Well, at its core, it\u2019s just well-intentioned chicken and vegetable soup, distributed to NHS key workers by the newly formed Yorkshire-based food charity Food4Heroes. \u201cJust like Boris, it\u2019s invigorating, it\u2019s robust and it\u2019ll put colour in your cheeks,\u201d F4H co-founder Mandy Guest told the Telegraph. And yes, I wish she hadn\u2019t said \u201ccolour in your cheeks\u201d either, because \u201cBoris Broth\u201d already sounds like the sort of restorative portions the PM has been spaffing around town for many years now. \u201cIt\u2019s a sustaining tonic for those in good health and a restorative for those recovering from illness,\u201d she continued. Again, this just looks like a 2am text message our prime minister might send to someone else\u2019s girlfriend. This does not sound like an advertisement for soup.\n\nBut then, we\u2019ve been waiting for something like this: quarantine, for many, inspires nostalgia for the aftermath of a long-ago war, and there\u2019s a very real feeling among a certain subsection of the British public (a sort of sturdy-fingernailed middle class I am nominally labelling Kirstie Allsopp Ultras) that thinks that actually, rationing and queueing at the butcher\u2019s and eating leeks all the time and darning our own jumpers for four years would be a nice lark \u2013 and Boris Broth fits neatly into that.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s William Sitwell in the Telegraph, taking time out from his busy schedule of rolling up to vegan squats in a hazmat suit to drag the residents out into the streets and force-feed them bacon, who thinks this Boris Broth stuff is the 2020 equivalent of the wartime Woolton pie. \u201cWe have better and more ingredients than [Lord Woolton] could have dreamt of,\u201d Sitwell wrote this week, \u201cso, armed with a bowl of Boris Broth, we, the NHS staff and, indeed, the prime minister, can fight this enemy of the 21st century.\u201d Please, sir, may I have 13 ounces of sugar this week? I\u2019ve been especially, awfully good!\n\nMaybe we should just have a war after this. But only draft the weird 45- to 60-year-olds who want it. They can mortgage their houses and chip in for a munitions slush fund, and allotment out their gardens, and turn all the electric lights off in their houses at night and sleep in helmets; and I can live the normal life I want to, where I\u2019m allowed to buy crates of Heineken from the supermarket and go to overpriced burger bars in east London and lie down in parks without being arrested. And everyone can be happy, finally, everyone can be free.\n\nLet\u2019s all clap for Ben Fogle and his awful ideas\n\nWe never really question how Ben Fogle managed to wiggle his way into such a key position within British celebrity, do we? I think at some point we should: he was on Castaway 2000, the very doomed BBC show that stranded 36 people on an island for a year for no reason, and somehow footage of him greyly crying in that got him regular gigs doing Countryfile and rowing a lot, and now he\u2019s just there, constantly Fogling, and we never interrogate it. Nobody but Ben Fogle could ascend to the position of Ben Fogle by taking the bizarre, winding route that Ben Fogle took to get there.\n\nLatest on Fogle, anyway: he wants to harness the energy of the rapidly-getting-tedious-now NHS clap (I should clarify that I participate in the NHS clap, broadly think it is good, and find myself oddly moved by it every time it happens, but the discourse around it is rapidly approaching \u201cWHERE\u2019S YOUR POPPY?\u201d levels of delirium, and efforts to subvert the clap away from the NHS and on to a rapidly changing schedule of other nightly claps \u2013 a clap for Boris \u2013 now leads us down a slippery slope where the BBC has to issue clarifications on which nightly clap means what, so we can know what clap to clap or not clap for, and I do very strongly feel we should cap the clapping at: one weekly clap) and use that to make us all sing Happy Birthday to the Queen next week. You think this is a joke, don\u2019t you? You underestimate the intrinsic Fogleness of Ben Fogle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Queen\u2019s birthday next Tuesday,\u201d he tweeted today, sincerely, though I suppose it could still be an aftershock of that LSD he inadvertently took, once, seven years ago. \u201cLet\u2019s throw her a surprise. At 9am 21st April, we are calling on the whole country to sing Happy Birthday from our windows and doorsteps. Let our song bring good cheer not just to Her Majesty but to the whole nation #singforthequeen.\u201d After a fair amount of pushback Fogle pointed out that, actually, his daughter came up with it, so don\u2019t have a go. But it was too late, and the wheels were in motion. We were, all of us, Having A Go.\n\nI suppose, if nothing else, our time in lockdown is a good opportunity to develop one-sided feuds with our neighbours over very trite and insignificant things, and as a result I will be taking note of anyone who pops their head out around my way to sing Happy Birthday to the Queen because Ben Fogle told them to. If they even think about taking two walks a day after that, the police are getting called.\n\n\u2022 Joel Golby is a writer for the Guardian and Vice, and the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant", "author": ["Joel Golby"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/apr/16/steve-bell-ministry-coronavirus-truth-cartoon", "published": "2020-04-16T18:30:14", "title": "Steve Bell on the Ministry of Coronavirus Truth \u2013 cartoon", "text": "What term do you want to search?

The welcome news for shareholders was that their airline is not going bust this year. That\u2019s a low bar, but it had to be cleared.\n\nExtra borrowing, including \u00a3600m via the Bank of England-backed commercial paper scheme, means easyJet will soon have access to about \u00a33.3bn of cash, enough to survive nine months of grounded planes, a scenario it calculates would cost a hefty \u00a33bn.\n\nThe bad news is that nobody knows when flying will resume \u2013 or, more to the point, in what form. Chief executive Johan Lundgren can whistle cheerfully about strong demand for winter bookings but rolling lockdowns across Europe, lifted and reimposed at different paces, would be hellishly disruptive.\n\nLeaving the middle seats on the planes vacant \u2013 one idea floated by Lundgren \u2013 would add yet another layer of complexity. Punters might revolt if safer spacing implied higher fares. Life for budget airlines in the first months after lockdown could be anything from boom time to profitless frustration.\n\nThen there\u2019s Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. One must file the founder and 34% shareholder (with his siblings) under entertainment because his missives from Monaco are becoming wilder. He will be driven mad by knowing easyJet is still burning \u00a330m-\u00a340m of cash a week as the planes sit idle, but he does not help his case for faster retrenchment by calling the directors \u201cscoundrels\u201d seven times in as many paragraphs.\n\nHaji-Ioannou\u2019s serious point is that easyJet should simply cancel its order of new Airbus aircraft. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that easy, as Lundgren explained persuasively. EasyJet would lose discounts on planes already delivered and sacrifice warranties and guarantees on the current fleet. Both are very bad outcomes if you intend to stay in the flying business.\n\nMeanwhile, the delivery schedule for planes doesn\u2019t look quite so awful after a rejig. EasyJet can reduce its fleet, currently 337, to a minimum of 281 by 2023, which isn\u2019t a million miles from the 250 demanded by Haji-Ioannou. The founder\u2019s campaign is a distraction. The board\u2019s self-help strategy is more credible than his.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell\u2019s zero-carbon strategy is short on details\n\nIt would be churlish not to applaud Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s ambition to be a net zero-carbon company by 2050. And, in some respects, its declaration was better than BP\u2019s in February.\n\nShell\u2019s statement is an \u201call company\u201d affair, so does not exclude problematic interests such as BP\u2019s stake in Rosneft. Shell has also set a few interim targets \u2013 for example, reducing the carbon intensity of products it sells to customers by 30% by 2035, versus 20% previously.\n\nYet the talk about \u201cpivots\u201d and \u201cpathways\u201d \u2013 two of the vaguest terms in the book of management-speak \u2013 will provoke scepticism. What does the plan mean for metrics that are easy to understand? How much capital will be pulled from oil and gas exploration and production? And how much will be redirected towards greener fuels such as hydrogen and biomass? Without details, it\u2019s hard to judge the credibility of the plans.\n\n\u201cAs of today, Shell\u2019s operating plans and budgets do not reflect these newly announced ambitions,\u201d said the third footnote to Thursday\u2019s announcement. In other words, come back later in the year to discover the stuff that really matters. It\u2019s progress, but it\u2019s slow.\n\nAston Martin benefits from Stroll\u2019s long-term vision\n\nLawrence Stroll, the Canadian billionaire, did not invest in Aston Martin out of a sense of charity. He took the plunge to make money, sensing he could bag a bargain at a low point for an over-indebted luxury car brand that he judged had more mileage left in it.\n\nIt\u2019s just as well, then, that Stroll\u2019s vision was for the long-term. The short-term looks horrible. Aston Martin\u2019s shares fell another 11% on Thursday to 50.5p (they floated at \u00a319 only 18 months ago), taking the market capitalisation to just \u00a3760m.\n\nThe cash proceeds from the \u00a3365m rights issue, due to complete formally on Monday, are rock solid and, for that, Aston Martin has Stroll to thank.

Coronavirus is its big chance | Samuel Earle", "text": "The fear of infection has always been intimately related to the fear of foreigners. \u201cKEEP OUT THE GERMS\u201d, the Daily Mail declared in a front page editorial on 3 January 1962, as panic about a smallpox outbreak spread across Britain. By \u201cgerms,\u201d the Daily Mail really meant foreigners: the editorial singled out Pakistani migrants who arrived from the \u201cendemic home of the disease\u201d, where there was then a smallpox epidemic, and \u201cwalked in [to Britain] without any trouble and were at once a peril to the population\u201d.\n\n'Coughing while Asian': living in fear as racism feeds off coronavirus panic Read more\n\nThat spring, the Conservative government passed the 1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act, finally ending free movement within the Commonwealth and remaining colonies. The health scare surrounding \u201cimported\u201d smallpox \u2013 Britain believed that it had long left this disease behind \u2013 coincided with Enoch Powell\u2019s stint as minister of health, and helped to nullify parliamentary opposition to the new legislation. As one Labour MP complained, the Conservative government had made border controls \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d, as if immigrants put the health of the nation at stake. If colonial subjects couldn\u2019t be ruled, it seemed, they were neither safe nor welcome.\n\nToday, the coronavirus pandemic poses a far more serious threat to national health than the smallpox epidemic, which led to fewer than 100 cases in Britain. Debate rages as to what our post-pandemic world will look like. Socialists, nationalists, internationalists, liberals \u2013 all see reason to believe, or hope, that the future belongs to them. For now, however, it\u2019s hard not to think we\u2019re living in a dystopian version of Blue Labour\u2019s Britain: left on the economy, right on culture, a stronger state, tighter borders \u2013 we\u2019re all (locked) in this together.\n\nIn many ways, the pandemic fits most neatly into nationalist narratives: there are few more powerful or reactionary forces in politics than fear, and this is surely the pandemic\u2019s most viral emotion. The outbreak of xenophobia accompanying the fear of infection has been well documented since coronavirus emerged. The disease was first portrayed as a distinctly \u201cChinese virus\u201d, originating in Wuhan, and people perceived as Asian were subjected to racist attacks around the world. Yet there seems less acknowledgment that this divisive, hostile symptom of the outbreak will likely outlive the disease. In China, for example, where cases of infection have sharply declined, black people are being subjected to random testing and evicted from their homes over anxieties about \u201cimported coronavirus\u201d. Everywhere you look, as Susan Sontag observed in Aids and Its Metaphors, there is the same need \u201cto make a dreaded disease foreign\u201d.\n\nThe link between \u201cgermophobia\u201d and xenophobia is a recurring theme in politics. The left has not been immune from this trope. In 1958, for example, when tuberculosis was the disease-du-jour, the Trades Union Council warned the Ministry of Labour against Indian and Pakistani immigration, drawing on classic xenophobic anxieties. Key among their concerns were \u201cthe poor health of these immigrants and the belief that many of them are carriers of contagious and infectious diseases\u201d.\n\nBut a wealth of research suggests that not only is the fear of infection more pronounced on the right, but also \u2013 more worryingly \u2013 that political attitudes become more conservative and reactionary as fears of infection rise. Indeed, one of the primary causes of \u201cgermophobia\u201d is living in cultures that stress hygienic practices (for good reason, that accounts for much of the world right now). A 2011 study conducted at Cornell University suggested that even standing people next to a hand sanitiser dispenser or asking them to wash their hands is enough to make them identify as more conservative. In another 2012 study, researchers from Hong Kong found that people who were shown scenes from Outbreak \u2013 a 1995 film set in the midst of an epidemic \u2013 became more conformist in their views, wanting to align themselves with a perceived majority. It\u2019s easy to see how, on a societal scale, this could feed into more xenophobia.\n\nAt times, such studies about politics and germs stray into the dubious terrain of evolutionary psychology. Rather than acknowledging the political prejudices that could lead one to be hostile towards perceived \u201coutsiders\u201d, a fear of strangers is said to spring \u201cnaturally\u201d \u2013 apolitically, a-culturally \u2013 from the human aversion to infection. But as the anthropologist Mary Douglas showed in her 1966 book Purity and Danger, defining what counts as \u201cdirty\u201d (not to mention who counts as a \u201cstranger\u201d) is a cultural act: it is at least as much about identity formation \u2013 defining \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d \u2013 as it is about hygiene.\n\nThe grim frequency with which dirt and disease are associated with \u201cdangerous\u201d outsiders speaks to the emotional force of this narrative. From portraying minorities as \u201cvermin\u201d to casting concerns about immigration as concerns about public health, the political expedience of this conflation has been affirmed again and again. According to a recently published working paper, the Republican party\u2019s weaponisation of the Ebola crisis in 2014 \u2013 stoking paranoia and blaming immigration \u2013 played an important role in their resounding victory in that year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nNone of this bodes well for our situation, where the fear of infection is already being mobilised to reactionary ends in countries such as Hungary, India, Israel and Algeria. \u201cWe are fighting a two-front war,\u201d Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n declared last month, shortly before imposing coronavirus laws that amount to a de facto dictatorship. \u201cOne front is called migration and the other one belongs to the coronavirus. There is a logical connection between the two as both spread with movement.\u201d\n\nIn the US, Donald Trump \u2013 a self-described \u201cgermophobe\u201d \u2013 plays the same blame game. Even as he downplays the crisis, his popularity in the polls remains strong. To almost every critic of his slow response, he points to how quickly he introduced a travel ban against China, and insists on calling the disease the \u201cChinese virus\u201d \u2013 ignoring that the US is on course to be the worst-affected industrialised country in the world.\n\nTrump\u2019s been here before. On the campaign trail in 2015, he warned of \u201ctremendous infectious disease \u2026 pouring across the border\u201d. Now, Trump says simply, \u201cwe need a wall more than ever\u201d \u2013 he was right all along. The belief that barbed wire, if we can only build it high enough, will \u201ckeep out the germs\u201d is an attractive placebo for reactionary fears. And it will take more than the pandemic finally passing for this illusion, and all its toxic consequences, to lift.\n\n\u2022 Samuel Earle is a writer based in London", "author": ["Samuel Earle"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/after-coronavirus-boris-johnsons-tories-will-be-a-very-different-party", "published": "2020-04-16T05:00:34", "title": "After coronavirus, Boris Johnson's Tories will be a very different party | Martin Kettle", "text": "It is only four months since Boris Johnson led the Conservative party to a historic victory. His 80-seat majority seemed to recast the electoral landscape for a generation. It also marked another milestone in Brexit\u2019s transformation of the Conservative party from the party of business to the party of the flag. Today, that seems like another world.\n\nEverything has been upended by Covid-19. The business of government is wholly taken up with protecting public health, keeping the economy on life support and, in Johnson\u2019s own case, his personal survival. Today the national lockdown is expected to be extended into May.\n\nIt seems likely that the Britain which eventually emerges from the coronavirus crisis will be a country of a significantly different temper from the Britain that went into it. Nobody can be certain about the degree of change. The possibility that the economy may shrink by a third, with millions of job losses, is a reality check about a more enduringly difficult new normal. The post-pandemic Conservative party must adapt too. But in what ways?\n\nFuture British politics will not shake down into a binary choice between the economy and public health. The need to restore both will be far messier than that. Political horizons will simultaneously be very wide \u2013 global issues of health, supply chains, travel, information and Chinese power will surge up the agenda \u2013 and very narrow: local issues about safe ways to work, earn, live and survive a future pandemic will matter more too. Politics will be more fragile, fearful and dynamic.\n\nWhile the pandemic and the lockdown hold sway, the official Conservative position is to ensure the least bad of all possibilities. The policy can be summed up by Rishi Sunak\u2019s comments this week. \u201cThe single most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people,\u201d said the chancellor on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of choosing between the economy and public health.\u201d\n\nHowever, once discussion moves on to the so-called exit strategy and to the post-Covid future, as it is now beginning to do, this begins to change. The choices do not suddenly become absolute. Instead they become competing calculations of the balance of risk in the interaction between the economy and public health, as and when the pandemic wanes. That has to be one of the reasons why Keir Starmer is pressing the government to publish its strategy. He knows this will reveal faultlines and compromises that an opposition can exploit without appearing partisan or unpatriotic.\n\nThere are some signs of those tensions already appearing within Conservative ranks. Sajid Javid, Sunak\u2019s more fiscally cautious predecessor, warned this week against mortgaging the future, and said low taxes remained key to kickstarting the economic recovery. Theresa May and several of her ex-ministers, including Philip Hammond, believe something similar. But Johnson will want to go on spending, not reinventing austerity. So will the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who will press for a large programme of resilience measures in health and social care to guard against a future pandemic. The new Tory MPs from the former industrial areas will agree with them. So, at least for now, will Sunak.\n\nWhere this process of change will eventually lead the Tory party is difficult to predict. Sunak\u2019s autumn budget \u2013 in which the social care agenda that was abandoned in 2017 will surely have to be a central focus \u2013 looms increasingly as a vital moment. But all this will surely generate a rather different party, and with rather different priorities, from the one that Johnson led to victory last December.\n\nWhether the Tory party successfully embraces the choices that will now face it depends overwhelmingly on Johnson himself. After 2019, the party is unusually dependent on the man at the top. The reshuffled cabinet consists mainly of minister of state-level players whom Johnson dominates from No 10. Its lack of depth has been cruelly exposed in the crisis. The party remains very much Johnson\u2019s own brand, held together by his inimitable personality and popularity.\n\nFor as long as Johnson remains out of action, the important choices about the party\u2019s direction are likely to be deferred. The party which, only a few weeks ago, Johnson and Dominic Cummings were building on the basis of Brexit and the anger of the left-behind is becoming less relevant by the day in the shadow of coronavirus.\n\nCoronavirus has made the BBC's balancing act even harder | Tom Mills Read more\n\nThe dissonance between the new realities and the recent past is now huge. Instead of the old contempt towards experts, competence and seriousness, there is now a craving for all three to help steer a safe course through the Covid-19 crisis. The idea that the government\u2019s post-pandemic priorities might include lighting fires under the BBC, the civil service and the universities therefore seems even more destructive now than before. The idea that Britain should be a Brexit buccaneer, turning its back resolutely against Europe and throwing itself into the arms of Donald Trump seems even more irresponsible.\n\nAs one former minister put it to me this week: \u201cThe party that was being created in the wake of the election was a new one. It was based on a cultural backlash against liberalism and established elites at home and abroad. But that doesn\u2019t feel to me like what the country wants now. It doesn\u2019t want divisive politics. It doesn\u2019t want a culture war. This feels like a moment to step away from a lot of that.\u201d Whether to take that step away will be very much Johnson\u2019s own decision. But it is a decision with momentous implications for the Tory party and for the whole of British party politics.\n\n\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist", "author": ["Martin Kettle"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-30000-americans-trump-blame-who", "published": "2020-04-16T11:32:08", "title": "Coronavirus has killed 30,000 Americans, and all Trump can do is blame the WHO", "text": "\u201cA crime against humanity.\u201d Richard Horton, the editor of The Lancet, spoke for many when he condemned the decision by President Trump to cut US funding to the World Health Organization, in the midst of a pandemic that has infected an estimated 2 million people, more than 137,000 of whom have died. Trump\u2019s disdain for international agreements is well known. In 2017 he pulled the United States out of UNESCO and the Paris climate accord. The following year he withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal. These departures take the United States even further outside the international system. It is already missing from the list of countries that have ratified some of the most important international agreements, including conventions on torture, discrimination against women, rights of the child, and landmines.\n\n'Crime against humanity': Trump condemned for WHO funding freeze Read more\n\nUntil now, world leaders have adhered to diplomatic protocol, avoiding anything but the mildest public criticism of this notoriously sensitive president. Their true feelings are only revealed when their private conversations are accidentally overheard. This time it\u2019s different. Simon Coveney, the foreign minister of Ireland, a country with exceptionally close ties with the United States, described Trump\u2019s decision to cut funds to WHO as an \u201cindefensible decision, in midst of global pandemic. So many vulnerable populations rely on WHO \u2013 deliberately undermining funding and trust now is shocking.\u201d Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister was slightly more restrained, tweeting that: \u201cBlaming does not help. The virus knows no borders\u201d. In the UK, however, where ministers are still hoping for a post-Brexit trade deal, a Downing Street spokesman rejected an invitation to join the condemnation, although they did voice support for the WHO.\n\nWhy undermine the organisation that is at the forefront of responding to a pandemic? For Trump, this seems particularly illogical \u2013 the pandemic has already killed more than 30,000 Americans. The answer is simple. In the midst of an election year, with his approval ratings falling, Trump needs to find someone else to blame. Now that the daily White House briefings have taken on the role of campaign rallies in locked down America, nothing can be allowed to undermine the narrative that he is the saviour of the American people. Failings are the fault of others. Once it was the Mexicans (ironically, Mexico is now restricting Americans from entering the country). Then it was China, whose political leaders Trump considers insufficiently obsequious. Now, he has redirected his ire at the WHO.\n\nIt hardly needs to be said that Trump has justified his decision with claims that fail to withstand the most basic scrutiny. He claims that the WHO was \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the early stages of the pandemic, thereby delaying the response by the United States. Yet the WHO had warned of person-to-person transmission as early as 23 January. Six days later, his economic adviser warned of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of American deaths. Trump ignored them both.\n\nThe decision will clearly damage the WHO. First, there is the loss of funding. As the world\u2019s richest country, the United States contributes 40% of the WHO\u2019s core budget, although this only amounts to 20% of its total spending. The US also contributes the largest share to the remaining 80% of voluntary contributions.\n\nThe US theoretically contributes roughly 10-15% of the WHO\u2019s budget as its largest contributor. It\u2019s uncertain whether Trump can legally block payments to the WHO\u2019s core budget, as these are authorised by Congress, but he could stop those voluntary payments made by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nWith a total contribution of a little under $900m, roughly what the NHS spends in 36 hours, other countries could step up to the mark to replace at least some of this shortfall. However, the decision will likely have a disproportionate effect on areas where the United States has made substantial earmarked contributions, such as polio eradication. More importantly, this is a massive distraction for an organisation working flat out to tackle one of the most serious threats to the health of everyone, including Americans, in decades.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of individual leaders and international cooperation. In a world where Jair Bolsanaro can threaten the world by allowing the Amazon to burn, or Donald Trump can undermine those leading the response to a pandemic, the need for a new international order has never been more urgent.\n\n\u2022 Martin McKee is professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and an adviser to the World Health Organization", "author": ["Martin Mckee", "Heidi Shierholz", "Robert Reich", "Renee C Wurth", "Jeffrey Pfeffer"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/exit-the-house-of-karrimor-enter-the-austere-and-unforgiving-house-of-saud", "published": "2020-04-16T18:23:25", "title": "Exit, the House of Karrimor.

But given the chairman of the Saudi Private Investment Fund, Mohammed bin Salman, owns a painting that cost more than Newcastle, it seems likely any hitches can be smoothed over.

West Ham are 10% owned by Blackstone Finance, part-funded by the Saudis. Saudi Arabia owns a stake in Uber, who have previously teamed up with Chelsea.

That is despite the fact that any date for football\u2019s return remains contingent upon government advice, with the lockdown of UK homes and businesses extended on Thursday for at least another three weeks.\n\nIt is understood that as many as nine clubs are backing the 30 June plan, deeming it necessary to avoid players running out of contract and transferring before the season is finished. Such a situation is believed to affect up to 80 players in the division, and while Fifa recently made provisions for clubs to temporarily extend deals over the summer, some legal experts have advised this could be challenged under UK law.\n\nThere also remains uncertainty inside the Premier League as to how such a plan would work in practice, especially if it were not possible to complete all of the remaining 92 fixtures before July. The plan is not among those modelled by its football department, which has been tasked with drawing up alternative options for the season to end.\n\nThe Brighton chairman, Tony Bloom, said on Thursday he is against the idea. \u201cThere does come a point when we can\u2019t keep waiting but I don\u2019t think 30 June is that point,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom our point of view, and the majority of Premier League clubs, we would very much like to finish the season; for the integrity of the league it would be very good to finish it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s talk about player contracts and sponsorship and it\u2019s difficult to play beyond that, but this situation is so unique and unprecedented every option should be looked at.\u201d\n\nAny proposal would ultimately need the vote of 14 of the 20 clubs to succeed.

Thousands of people from all over the world, gathered together, moving around, from town to town, this is where a virus could thrive \u2013 it could be a recipe for disaster,\u201d Sridhar said.\n\nShe also suggested those arriving in Nice for the race from countries outside France should be quarantined. \u201cThis [the arrival of the Tour\u2019s international convoy] could set off a new cluster of infections so you\u2019d have to think, at minimum, of a two- to three-week quarantine before they properly come into the country.\u201d\n\nIdeally, Sridhar said, while acknowledging the logistics would be \u201cmind-boggling\u201d, once the race has started the organisation would test everybody in the convoy every day. \u201cWe know 20% to 60% of people are pre-symptomatic, in that they feel fine and exhibit no symptoms but are passing the virus to others.\u201d\n\nWhile most European riders have reacted positively to the new scheduling, the participation of some, including the defending champion Egan Bernal, who is confined to Colombia, is not yet a given.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t escaped me that the current champion is in Colombia, but Europe is at the heart of cycling and the majority of riders live in Europe,\u201d the Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, said.\n\nThe rescheduled dates have also caused a headache for other lesser race promoters, including the Tour of Britain organiser Sweetspot, as the postponed Tour de France now clashes with its own race on 6-13 September. Another problem for the British race is a clash of live TV coverage as the official race broadcaster ITV also shows each stage of the French race.\n\n\u201cThe position we find ourselves in is unprecedented,\u201d Sweetspot said in a statement. \u201cWe are closely monitoring each development as it happens and acting accordingly with our partners and stakeholders across Britain to do the right thing, with the health and wellbeing of all of our supporters being of paramount importance.\u201d", "author": ["Jeremy Whittle"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/world-rugby-sends-80m-coronavirus-relief-fund-to-national-unions-rugby-union", "published": "2020-04-16T17:15:06", "title": "RFU faces new multimillion losses if international rugby scrapped for 2020", "text": "The Rugby Football Union could face further multimillion pound losses after World Rugby revealed that despite extensive contingency plans to save the 2020 Test calendar, the worst-case scenario is that \u201cno international rugby is possible this year\u201d.\n\nThe RFU is already forecasting losses of \u00a350m over the next 18 months but that is on the basis that England\u2019s four November matches, against New Zealand, Tonga, Argentina and Australia, take place.\n\nThe Breakdown | Rugby needs to re-engage with supporters it has taken for granted Read more\n\nOn Thursday, however, World Rugby announced that while it is hopeful that all Tests will be played, the global game\u2019s governing body is also planning for a scenario in which the international schedule is scrapped.\n\nAs the RFU has no pandemic insurance it comes as a hammer blow to the union\u2019s finances. The RFU\u2019s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, said last week he was hopeful that England could play up to seven matches this year. That remains the best-case scenario according to World Rugby, but the alternative paints a bleak picture for the RFU, which can generate around \u00a310m per home Test, with matches at Twickenham making up 85% of the union\u2019s revenue.\n\nOn Thursday World Rugby also announced an \u00a380m emergency fund for the unions, but while the RFU intends to take advantage of the rescue package, its share (around \u00a38m) would not cover what would be a huge shortfall if the November Tests are called off.\n\nAlready the RFU has implemented 25% pay cuts for its executive team, including Sweeney and the head coach, Eddie Jones, and has introduced a wage reduction scheme across the organisation. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe RFU is projecting significant losses to revenue and we welcome all support from the government and international federations to help sustain the game across England and the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nAs things stand England are due to tour Japan in July but it is inevitable the trip will be called off and Sweeney has already suggested they could travel to Japan in October instead. He has also mooted a \u201chome-and-away\u201d Six Nations tournament, beginning in November and concluding next spring if southern hemisphere teams are not able to travel north, either due to lockdown restrictions or the need to finish competitions such as Super Rugby and the Rugby Championship.\n\nWorld Rugby gave that idea its backing yesterday/on Thursday by confirming plans for a \u201ccompetition environment where cross-hemisphere travel might not be possible\u201d. If that competition does go ahead, and given England still have to finish this year\u2019s Six Nations campaign with a trip to Italy, Jones\u2019s side could be in action for weeks on end. Equally, however, England may not play again until next year\u2019s Six Nations at the earliest.\n\nWorld Rugby said its plans include possible provision for \u201cshort-term reshaping of the international rugby calendar [and] optimising competition opportunities for unions and domestic leagues\u201d.\n\nDespite the \u00a380m emergency fund, if there are no more matches at all this year it would be catastrophic for the rest of the world\u2019s unions.

The four-hour virtual meeting was the second in seven days to discuss the proposed changes as the sport attempts to come to terms with the financial implications of the virus. The president of the FIA, Jean Todt, described it on Twitter as an \u201cImportant meeting by video conference today with Chase Carey, @F1 & @FIA teams to build together a New Deal for the future of our sport\u201d.\n\nThe discussion centred on setting a ceiling of $145m for 2021 and then $130m in 2022.

Race hosting fees are one of the three major sources of income for the sport and they are highly likely to take a major hit. Should more races be cancelled or postponed, broadcasting fees and sponsorship income are also likely to suffer.\n\nThe concept of a sliding scale for the volume of aerodynamic research based on a team\u2019s position in the constructors\u2019 championship, weighted in favour of reverse order of success, was also discussed. The idea is understood to have been viewed favourably by F1.\n\nThe McLaren team principal, Andreas Seidl, has been emphatic in warning that F1 could lose smaller teams if it failed to address the spending issue and his team had been pushing for a cap of $100m.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ross Brawn said: \u2018The dial has been set at 11 for too long.

We need to wind it down. We said this [sort of crisis] was what the budget cap was for when it was introduced.

There are serious staffing implications with such a drastic cut for the top three teams, who employ between 800 and 1,000 staff.\n\nThere had already been an informal agreement to drop the cap to $150m but it is understood both Red Bull and Ferrari were resistant to it falling any further. Ferrari\u2019s team principal, Mattia Binotto, had pointed out that a flat rate ceiling did not necessarily work across the board. \u201cWhen discussing a budget cap, we should not forget that we\u2019ve got different situations, and it\u2019s important that we find common ground somehow which is suited to the different situations,\u201d he said last week. \u201cThere is still analysis required to make the right decisions. I think we should avoid being really emotional at the moment.\u201d\n\nFerrari had pointed out that smaller teams buy parts form the larger ones and that they do not have to spend on research and development on these parts.

He has lived in Paris for several months, where his talent has blossomed to world elite levels.\n\nChess: Magnus Carlsen prepares for meeting with prodigy Alireza Firouzja Read more\n\nHis speciality is one-minute bullet chess, at which he beat Carlsen on 2 April in an informal first to 100 wins match. At very fast speeds manual dexterity is important, and some blamed Carlsen\u2019s defeat on his using a mouse while Firouzja was quicker using finger touch.\n\nWednesday\u2019s final was at Banter Blitz, where players comment verbally on their moves during the game. The time limit was three minutes per player per game, without the one-second or two-second per move increment which is normal for three-minute blitz. Again Firouzja was noticeably faster. He won two games on time and in another Carlsen escaped by checkmating with just 0.2 seconds to spare. While Carlsen kept up an articulate running commentary throughout, Firouzja, whose English is weaker, made fewer early comments and was usually ahead on time after the opening.\n\nCarlsen was the heavy favourite following his impressive 9-0 semi-final win over the strong Russian Sanan Sjugirov, whereas Firouzja had struggled to defeat the Indian Srinath Narayanan 9-6. But in the final Firouzja was sharper, continually producing tactical tricks which rarely gave his opponent the classically controlled games where he dominates. If there is a historic parallel to this match, it would be the world title matches of 60-70 years ago where David Bronstein and Mikhail Tal also used their combinative ability to disrupt Mikhail Botvinnik\u2019s strategic rhythm.\n\nThis weekend sees the start of the $250,000 Magnus Carlsen Invitational, the richest ever online tournament and planned as a showpiece for the world champion\u2019s skills. After the events of 2 April and this Wednesday, however, the Invitational has suddenly become a battlefield for survival for its originator.\n\nOne can excuse Carlsen\u2019s defeats at bullet and blitz as significantly an effect of the playing conditions and time limit which favoured Firouzja, but the Invitational has rapid time controls, 15 minutes per player per game plus a 10 seconds per move increment.\n\nMagnus Carlsen's online tournament taps into new internet chess boom Read more\n\nBack in December Firouzja had Carlsen close to defeat at the World Blitz and won the silver medal behind Carlsen in the World Rapid, but next month at Wijk aan Zee at slower time limits the established elite defeated the teen. Four months further on, and Firouzja is clearly improving as fast as Bobby Fischer or Garry Kasparov did in their teenage years. So the stakes will be high at the Invitational and especially next Monday. Another success for Firouzja and much of the chess world will view him as the heir apparent to Carlsen\u2019s throne.\n\nFirst round pairings starting at 3pm this Saturday, are Carlsen (Norway) v Hikaru Nakamura (US) and Firouzja v Ding Liren (China), followed on Sunday by Fabiano Caruana (US) v Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia), Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) v Anish Giri (Netherlands).

But some local authorities reported an increase in applications this year and a fall in the proportion of children getting into their first-choice school.\n\nCompetition for places remains intense in London, where applications have increased, reversing last year\u2019s trend. Of the 97,300 pupils who applied for a primary school place in the capital, less than 85% got into their first choice, down from 86% last year, and 5,000 children did not get into any of their top three schools.\n\nBirmingham also experienced an increase in applications of more than 14,400, which has had a similar effect on the success rate of applications. The percentage of families getting their first choice slipped from 89% last year to just under 88%.\n\nFor families wishing to appeal, the Department for Education has announced plans to temporarily relax regulations so that hearings can go ahead despite the Covid-19 restrictions. They will no longer need to be attended in person.\n\nRichard Long, Kent county council\u2019s cabinet member for education and skills, said: \u201cSince the partial closure of all our schools last month, everyone involved in the provision of education has \u2026 been working in challenging circumstances, and it is a credit to them that we are still able to release offers today.\u201d\n\nIn Kent, where primary schools will welcome almost 18,000 pupils in September \u2013 their biggest cohort in four years \u2013 just over 88% gained a place in their top choice, 97% got into one of their three preferred schools, and just over 450 did not get any of their preferences.\n\nLong said: \u201cI appreciate that for those families who did not receive one of their preferences there will be feelings of disappointment and concern today. I would like to reassure them that this is just the first stage of the application process.\n\n\u201cFamilies have the option to appeal or join a waiting list for an alternative school if they are not happy with their allocation and there is likely to be considerable movement between now and September as families do not take up places they are offered.\u201d\n\nDevon also saw a big jump in the number of families applying for a place in reception this September, with more than 7,500 applications, up 300 on last year. Almost 95% of families got their first preference and 98% got into one of their top three.\n\nIn York, the percentage of families given their first choice fell from 96% last year to 94%; in Reading, Berkshire, 83% of children got their first preference, while in nearby Wokingham, 85% got their top choice, also a drop on 2019.\n\nIn Manchester, where there has previously been high demand, applications fell from 7,057 last year to 6,921. As a result, 92.1% of families got their first choice compared with 90.9% in 2019, and 97.8% of applicants got one of their top three choices, up from 97.2% last year.\n\nJust over 97% of families in the East Riding of Yorkshire got their first pick, in Derbyshire it was 95%, and in Wiltshire 94%.

It said that food prices had been relatively stable over the period from 16 March, just before lockdown measures began, to 12 April. Prices for pet food, which contributed the biggest rise in the overall index, and rice rose by 8.4% and 5.8% over the past month, while prices of pasta sauce fell by 4.5%.\n\nThe government sets an annual inflation target for the Bank of England of 2% based on a much broader basket of goods and services, which the ONS said should not be directly compared with its experimental statistics.

But the alternative \u2013 leaving asymptomatic, but potentially infectious staff on the wards \u2013 runs contrary to the principle of \u201cdo no harm\u201d, Swanton said.\n\nPatients were very aware of the risk, he added, and were staying at home due to justified fears that they could contract the virus by attending hospitals or seeing GPs. \u201cThey\u2019re too scared to go to hospital and you can understand why,\u201d Swanton said.\n\nThe situation appears to be causing fewer emergency calls from people who have suffered strokes or heart attacks, potentially fuelling the rise in non-coronavirus deaths seen in figures released this week. Those with other conditions may also be deterred from seeking medical help.\n\nOn Thursday the Guardian reported that London A&E chiefs were concerned that patients were staying away, saying in a meeting last week: \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to go near hospital. As a result salvageable conditions are not being treated.\u201d\n\nSwanton, who is also chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that cancer patients need to be able to have the confidence to come into wards.

It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back\n\na new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. How many people have been affected? China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.\n\nThere is growing evidence that a significant proportion of people infected with Covid-19 show few or no symptoms and that up to half of transmission may take place before symptoms occur.\n\nA study of people onboard the formerly quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was docked in Yokohama, Japan, found 328 of the 634 positive cases (52%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing, and other studies have found a range of 20-80% of people carrying the virus but showing no symptoms.\n\nTo identify such cases, healthcare workers had ideally to be screened weekly in high-risk areas, Swanton said.\n\nGraham Cooke, professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, agreed that screening should be seriously considered as the testing capacity is increased this month.\n\n\u201cI do think we need to raise the conversation about large-scale testing in healthcare settings,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got good evidence that there\u2019s significant transmission in people who are pre-symptomatic. We\u2019ve got concerns about transmission in hospitals and we\u2019ve got much-improved capacity for testing. There are reasons to be cautious, but one of them is not to be afraid of what we might find.\u201d\n\nThe government has not released figures on the rates of hospital-acquired Covid-19, but there are calls for this data to be collected and made public.\n\n\u201cIn Sars onward transmission in hospitals was a huge problem,\u201d said Carl Heneghan, a professor and director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, at the University of Oxford. \u201cThere\u2019s a data crisis here. We don\u2019t know what proportion are being admitted with Covid-19 and what proportion are getting it in hospital.

Thousands of workers have been furloughed, with the government paying 80% of their wages under its jobs retention scheme.\n\nDavid Connell, human resources director for Groupe PSA, told the Guardian that the company had been working on plans to restart production ever since they shut down, as long as they could guarantee worker safety.\n\nHe said the company had developed processes to allow workers to return in a \u201csafe and responsible manner\u201d.

Hand dryers will be replaced with paper towels.\n\nAll kitchen facilities will be closed.\n\nRest areas have been moved to unenclosed spaces that allow two metre distancing.\n\nThe government is balancing its desire for people to stay in work \u2013 limiting the economic damage of lockdown \u2013 against concerns that any easing of lockdown could allow the virus to spread.\n\nOther manufacturers have taken a more cautious approach to reopening, with a source at another major carmaker with UK operations saying it was too early.\n\nOne concern across the car industry is the lack of demand for new products, with showrooms likely to remain closed and the prospect of a big rise in unemployment hitting spending power.\n\nConnell said: \u201cWe need to be able to get back to production, but the other part of the equation is that there needs to be an end customer.

The tool has a wider range of tests than reCaptcha, including one asking users to draw a box around a specific object, or to identify the correct label for a picture.\n\nGoogle\u2019s reCaptcha had been free for so long because, as well as testing whether a site visitor is a robot, it uses humans to do menial tasks. The first version asked users to transcribe hard-to-read words from scanned books, while later versions used similar technology to get people to label images.

However, they could be detected by atmospheric measuring equipment on the accompanying vessel.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A trial on the Great Barrier Reef of cloud brightening equipment.

Today, however, many are claiming that El Hoyo \u2013 known in English as The Platform \u2013 is the perfect parable for life in the time of the coronavirus and a visceral investigation of how a crisis can expose not only the stratification of human society but also the immutable strands of selfishness coded into our DNA.\n\nThe parallels are certainly not hard to find. The Platform is set in a forbidding \u201cvertical self-management centre\u201d \u2013 a soaring series of concrete cells stacked one on top of the other, each holding two inmates. Every day, the eponymous platform, stacked with a lavish but finite supply of food and drink, descends, level by level.\n\nThose on each floor are free to decide how much they eat and how much they leave for those on the hundreds of levels beneath them. If they gorge themselves, they will starve those below; if they try to hoard food, the temperature in their cell will rise or fall fatally.\n\nWhile Gaztelu-Urrutia is delighted by the film\u2019s growing audience on Netflix, he is as surprised by its freshly minted relevance as anyone else. \u201cIt\u2019s an allegory about the distribution of wealth, which is a universal debate and a debate that\u2019s been going on for as long as people have been around,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia on set during the shooting of El Hoyo (The Platform).\n\n\u201cBut I remember when we were showing it at a film festival in Toronto last year, people were saying, \u2018Shit! Historically speaking, this is the ideal moment to be showing a film like this because the differences between those who have the most and those who have the least have never been as great as they are now.\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Well actually it\u2019s always the perfect time to be screening a film like The Platform because we\u2019ve always been living through at a time when these differences are so stark.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the director, who describes himself as \u201cbasically very pessimistic about us as a species\u201d, acknowledges that the pandemic and the film\u2019s presence on one of the world\u2019s largest streaming platforms have given the movie a new lease of life. \u201cWith the new showing on Netflix, it\u2019s suddenly become very topical again because of the current situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, instead of putting food on the platform, we\u2019d made it face masks or toilet paper or ventilators, we\u2019d be having exactly the same debate.\u201d\n\nThe other week, added Gaztelu-Urrutia, he was listening to Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, lament that US states were engaged in a bidding war for ventilators. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happens in The Platform,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia during the shooting of El Hoyo (The Platform). Photograph: El Hoyo/PR\n\n\u201cWhen things take a turn for the worse and we get squeezed a bit, we become very, very selfish and start stockpiling everything we can, just in case. We don\u2019t realise that that kind of greed means a lot of other people have to go without.\u201d\n\nAlthough Gaztelu-Urrutia stresses that the film \u2013 which began life as a theatre piece \u2013 contains instantly recognisable universal themes, it doesn\u2019t hide its Spanish roots. If there are occasional echoes of films such as High Rise, and The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, there are also pointed nods to Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s The Exterminating Angel. A copy of Don Quixote features heavily, as do the issues of imprisonment and free will explored in Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca\u2019s seminal Golden Age play Life is a Dream.\n\nAt its heart, though, it is a film with an uncomfortable message. \u201cThe point of The Platform is that it isn\u2019t about a war between those above and those below \u2013 we all have someone above us and someone below us,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s all very well, Gaztelu-Urrutia added, to demand action from the politicians and multibillionaires so many floors above, but their response \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 cannot be used to absolve us of individual responsibility. \u201cYou can look above you and think that the people up there should be doing much more, but then you look down and see there are many levels below yours,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is: what am I going to do from where I am to fight this selfish structure that runs throughout our society and species?\u201d", "author": ["Sam Jones"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/16/stephen-colbert-trump-only-cares-about-trump-late-night-roundup", "published": "2020-04-16T16:32:15", "title": "Stephen Colbert: Donald Trump 'only thinks about the needs of Donald Trump'", "text": "Late-night hosts on president\u2019s decision to take away funding to the World Health Organisation and what it means for the country\n\nLate-night hosts criticised Donald Trump\u2019s removal of funding to the World Health Organisation and discussed the racial disparities in the coronavirus.\n\nStephen Colbert picks apart Trump's latest 'hissy fit meltdown' Read more\n\nStephen Colbert\n\nOn The Late Show, Stephen Colbert started by saying he often ridicules the US president but this week has made him realise he doesn\u2019t \u201cdo it enough\u201d as he said that the latest developments have once again shown that Donald Trump \u201conly thinks about the needs of Donald Trump\u201d.\n\nHe said the president\u2019s decision to take money away from the WHO was a \u201crash and dangerous action\u201d that made no sense. \u201cIt\u2019s like when your house is engulfed in flames, first thing you do: burn down the fire department,\u201d he joked.\n\nThe move has angered many, including Bill Gates who warned of what would follow. \u201cI agree with Bill Gates and this time I\u2019m not just saying it to get in his will,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nTrump has claimed the WHO was too slow to act as Covid-19 started to spread and as a result, endangered millions. \u201cI think you might be projecting, sir,\u201d Colbert responded.\n\nThe president has still refused to explain what progress was made during the month of February. \u201cDoes Trump go into hibernation for Black History Month?\u201d Colbert asked.\n\nStimulus checks will soon be arriving for those who needs them and will include an extra $500 per child. \u201cFinally a reason for Trump to acknowledge the existence of Eric,\u201d he joked.\n\nBut there will be a delay as Trump has insisted his name should be on each one. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants a check that Trump signed,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cI think that legally makes you a porn star.\u201d\n\nSamantha Bee\n\nOn Full Frontal, Samantha Bee explored the racial disparity of the pandemic. In majority black areas, residents are three times more likely to get infected and six times more likely to die.\n\n\u201cFor people who have experiences racism their entire lives, these disparities seem obvious,\u201d Bee said.\n\nWhile social distancing guidelines have been shared, Bee said that in densely populated urban areas which are dominated by communities of colour, \u201cit can be hard to take even the most basic of precautions\u201d.\n\nSubway usage in New York City is down 87% but there have also been less services which have meant for essential workers, they\u2019re often surrounded by more people than usual. \u201cThis is the only time in history that manspreading is OK,\u201d Bee joked.\n\nShe also spoke about racial bias within the healthcare system and lower rates of testing for people of colour. Some mayors have taken it upon themselves to try and fix these inequalities, such as Boston\u2019s Marty Walsh.

Sep\u00falveda was particularly successful in Europe, where he had been based since the 80s.\n\nBorn in 1949 in Ovalle, north of the Chilean capital Santiago, Sep\u00falveda was a political activist from a young age, first for the Communist Youth of Chile, and then for the Socialist party.\n\nHe was arrested and jailed for treason for two and a half years in 1973 under the military regime of Pinochet, whose dictatorship lasted 17 years, during which at least 38,000 people were tortured and 3,200 people killed or disappeared.\n\nAfter intervention from Amnesty International, Sep\u00falveda was conditionally freed to house arrest.

But this film, obtusely, doesn\u2019t dramatise Ali himself, concentrating on the elderly judges, the cue for much twinkle-eyed character acting from Frank Langella and Christopher Plummer. It doesn\u2019t land much of a punch.\n\n21. Victoria & Abdul (2017)\n\nIn which Dench reprises her impersonation of Queen Victoria. The first time around, she was crushing hard on her ghillie, John Brown, played by Billy Connolly, and now it is her Muslim Indian servant Abdul Karim, played by Ali Fazal, in this based-on-a-true-story film. However, it\u2019s a very coy and bland piece of inoffensive heritage cinema.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Judi Dench and Ali Fazal in Victoria and Abdul (2017). Photograph: Allstar/BBC Films\n\n20. Lay the Favourite (2012)\n\nThis is a broad caper about gambling, the excitement of which is difficult to convey properly to uninitiated audiences. It is based on the avowedly true-life memoir of a woman who came to Vegas looking to be nothing more than a cocktail waitress and wound up deeply involved with the scary/thrilling high-rollers. Rebecca Hall is our heroine and Bruce Willis her grouchy boss. A bit moderate.\n\n19. Sammy and Rosie Get Laid (1987)\n\nThis multicultural London movie that Frears made in the Thatcher era was interesting, but didn\u2019t quite come off. The Sammy and Rosie of the title are Ayub Khan Din and Frances Barber, who have a bohemian existence in the capital; then Sammy\u2019s father (Shashi Kapoor) comes from Pakistan, disrupting their precarious happiness.\n\n18. Accidental Hero (1992)\n\nThis was a big role for Dustin Hoffman and an interesting and lively high-concept story \u2013 but the chemistry didn\u2019t quite work for the film to do as well as it might have done. He plays an oddball hustler midway between his characters in Rain Man and Midnight Cowboy.

It\u2019s a retelling of the Jekyll and Hyde story from the point of view of the maid (Roberts), who has no idea that her master, Dr Jekyll, and his sinister friend, Mr Hyde, are the same person \u2013 both played by John Malkovich. Atmospheric and interesting.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Malkovich and Julia Roberts in Mary Reilly, a retelling of the Jekyll and Hyde story. Photograph: Allstar/Tristar\n\n16. The Hit (1984)\n\nAn entertaining selection of well-directed performances keep this film going. Terence Stamp is the supergrass ex-criminal exiled in Spain who finds that old comrades have caught up with him, intent on settling scores. Played by John Hurt and a livewire young Tim Roth, they are disconcerted by Stamp\u2019s Zen acceptance of the situation.\n\n15. Liam (2000)\n\nWith a brutally tough screenplay from Jimmy McGovern, Frears strays here into what could be called Terence Davies territory. It\u2019s an account of a 1930s Catholic boyhood in Liverpool, in which Ian Hart plays Liam\u2019s dad, an embittered, unemployed docker with a taste for the booze who becomes a Mosleyite blackshirt, to his family\u2019s dismay. A tough watch, and atypically bleak for Frears.\n\n14. The Program (2015)\n\nThe strange case of Lance Armstrong is what Frears addresses in this serviceable biopic written by John Hodge. Ben Foster plays the fiercely committed, impregnably arrogant Armstrong, the Tour de France cyclist who first became an inspirational figure for surviving cancer, only to become notorious for doping and then a long battle with his own awful PR. Foster is very good at conveying Armstrong\u2019s beady-eyed fanaticism and inability to reconcile his \u201cunderdog hero\u201d view of himself with the public\u2019s deep disappointment.\n\n13. The Van (1996)\n\nThis is just the type of film that responds well to Frears\u2019 gift for getting strong, clear, funny performances across the board, and building the storytelling around them. Colm Meaney plays a shiftless guy in late-80s Ireland who is reasonably happy on welfare but has a Damascene conversion to entrepreneurialism. When his best mate Bimbo discovers an abandoned catering van, the pair have a plan to clean it up (sort of) and sell burgers and chips outside sports grounds.

The Hi-Lo Country (1998)\n\nThis is one of Frears\u2019 most underrated movies \u2013 a western, to which he brings a cool, understated intelligence and revisionist flair, working from a script by Walon Green, who also wrote The Wild Bunch. Patricia Arquette plays a lonely woman in postwar New Mexico who is drawn to a number of men who aren\u2019t her husband: Billy Crudup\u2019s young rancher and Woody Harrelson\u2019s outrageously brash cowboy. The booming-voiced Sam Elliott plays a wealthy local man who tries to help and advise the hopelessly naive Crudup. A film with real texture and force.\n\n11. Tamara Drewe (2010)\n\nAnother underrated movie from Frears, this satire canters enjoyably through the world of English middle-class hypocrisy and vanity. Frears makes this kind of comedy look easy, which is perhaps why it doesn\u2019t get its due. Screenwriter Moira Buffini adapts Posy Simmonds\u2019 graphic novel about a young woman (Gemma Arterton) who returns to her sleepy home village with a nose job and a glamorous position in the media, and promptly shakes everything up. There are great performances in particular from Roger Allam and Tamsin Greig.\n\n10. Gumshoe (1971)\n\nThis debut feature is an early gem in the Frears canon, with a great ensemble supporting cast including Frank Finlay and Billie Whitelaw, and a taut script from Neville Smith. Albert Finney stars as Eddie, an ordinary guy in Liverpool who is a bingo-caller and cheesy nightclub comic turn, with an unsightly line in the ugly racist banter of that era. But he also exists in a Walter Mitty fantasy world of private detectives, idolising the screen persona of Humphrey Bogart. When Eddie actually tries to live the private detective dream, by placing an ad for his dubious services in the local paper, someone actually takes him up on it. Soon he is hopelessly out of his depth and his unhinged mental state deteriorates.\n\n9. Florence Foster Jenkins (2016)\n\nThis biopic combines sentimentality, comedy and deep strangeness in equal measure. Meryl Streep plays the deluded amateur soprano and fashionable hostess Florence Foster Jenkins, whose off-key warbling at private events horrified 40s New York high society \u2013 but everyone was too polite to say anything, or too keen on Mrs Jenkins\u2019s lavish patronage and generosity to comment (other than giggling among themselves). Hugh Grant takes his career to the next level with a great performance as Jenkins\u2019s partner and husband in all but name, a failed thesp who sympathises with Florence\u2019s big dreams and wishes only to bring her some happiness. Streep and Grant are a lovely combination and their gentle chemistry, nurtured by Frears, allows this film to grow on you. At the end, you are laughing with them, not at them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hitting the right note: Meryl Streep in Florence Foster Jenkins. Photograph: Nick Wall/Allstar/BBC Films\n\n8. The Queen (2006)\n\nBefore there was The Crown, there was this movie, which bears about the same relationship to the racy TV show as Robert Altman\u2019s Gosford Park does to the later small-screen romp Downton Abbey. Screenwriter Peter Morgan showed his witty post-Tussaud mastery of fabricating the private talk of the great and the good, and Helen Mirren gives a lovely, award-winning impersonation of the Queen during the great crisis of 1997 when Princess Diana had just died in a car accident and the public and press appeared to be genuinely turning against Her Majesty for the first time in her long reign. Michael Sheen plays the young and guilelessly pushy new prime minister Tony Blair, who presumes to tell the Queen how to manage public opinion \u2014 and also wonders how her loss in reputation might result in a corresponding gain for his. Frears orchestrates all this with terrific brio and gusto, finding that keynote of comic indulgence amid the supposed seriousness and political gossip.\n\n7. Dirty Pretty Things (2002)\n\nThis urban-myth thriller from screenwriter Steven Knight has all the ingredients that Frears knows how to blend: a strong, accessible, exciting (and scary) story and three fiercely drawn characters, played to the hilt by three outstandingly good actors \u2013 Chiwetel Ejiofor, Audrey Tautou and Sergi Lopez \u2013 whose contributions are managed with great skill by the director. Ejiofor is the Nigerian \u201cillegal\u201d in London, working as a hotel night porter and driving a minicab during the day; Tautou is the similarly illegal Turkish woman working as a chambermaid at the same hotel, and Lopez is the sinister hotel manager who informs them that hotels are places where discretion among staff is essential. When Tautou and Ejiofor discover a grisly criminal conspiracy, their story tells us something about inequality and exploitation and how London relies on immigrants as a servant class, who must be demonised so that their wages can be kept low and their working conditions poor. Frears paints the drama with a slightly broad brush, but this is a great, underrated British movie, as relevant today as ever.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Audrey Tautou and Chiwetel Ejiofor in Dirty Pretty Things. Photograph: Allstar/BBC Films\n\n6. High Fidelity (2000)\n\nIn so many ways, High Fidelity is the perfect Frears project: relatable, smart, romantic, funny and sad, building on British wit to create a Hollywood picture with an indie sensibility. It was adapted from Nick Hornby\u2019s bestseller, transposing the action from north London to Chicago, and turning the hangdog, lovelorn owner of a record store (a retail concept that was more or less extinct even in 2000) into an American: John Cusack, whoalso co-wrote the film. The casting was perfect, and introduced Jack Black to a wider audience as Barry, the testy and massively opinionated music buff and store assistant who makes it his business to terrorise those customers whose tastes do not come up to scratch. Cusack\u2019s character has just been dumped, and all his misery and yearning are channelled into the music he loves. Is music where his fidelity or loyalty really lies, or can music be the gateway drug to real love and a real relationship? This film has been remade and re-franchised over the past 20 years, but this is the original and best.\n\n5. Dangerous Liaisons (1988)\n\nFrears delivered power, intrigue and sexual menace with this story of elegant cynicism set in 18th-century France \u2013 a parable of the arrogant ennui that prefigured the revolution. Glenn Close and John Malkovich play the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, former lovers who now jadedly amuse each other with their respective tales of adventures in seduction and the ruination of innocents. The Marquise spitefully bets the Vicomte that he can\u2019t have his way with a certain comely young woman (Uma Thurman), who has had the audacity to accept a marriage proposal from the Marquise\u2019s current lover, thus ending their arrangement. The Vicomte accepts the wager with alacrity and also sets out for another bedpost-notch: the lovely, virtuously married Madame de Tourvel, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. These liaisons are indeed dangerous in ways that the older epicures do not understand. They can fall in love, and fall in other ways as well. The central scene, when the entire theatre turns hissingly on the disgraced Marquise, is genuinely scary. The keynotes of drama and tragedy are atypical for Frears, but he handles them tremendously.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gary Oldman and Alfred Molina in Prick Up Your Ears.\n\nPhotograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n4. Prick Up Your Ears (1987)\n\nA recent re-release woke us up to what a belter this is, and what a masterly exercise in drama and characterisation from Frears, who guides two cracking performances from Gary Oldman and Alfred Molina in a true story of scandal and tragedy. Oldman plays the brilliant and troubled young dramatist Joe Orton who, in the 1960s, set the London arts scene alight with his talentand made no secret of his homosexuality, but evaded censure in an era when it was still illegal. Molina is Kenneth Halliwell, his lover and best friend who becomes unstable and obsessively jealous of Orton\u2019s colossal success while his own career as an actor is fizzling out. Eventually, this toxic and dysfunctional relationship explodes into violence. Alan Bennett\u2019s tremendous script is based on John Lahr\u2019s biography with its cheeky, naughty pun in the title. Vanessa Redgrave has a cameo as Joe\u2019s legendary agent, Peggy Ramsay. It is the perfect Frears storm of great actors, smart script and absorbing drama.\n\n3. My Beautiful Laundrette (1985)\n\nFrears brings us a classic of 80s British cinema here, with its script by Hanif Kureishi, a film that refuses to run on the usual rails of commercial film-making or even on the rails of politically correct or right-on attitudising, despite boldly taking on racism and homophobia. A young and exquisitely beautiful Daniel Day-Lewis plays Johnny, a racist thug who appears to be about to attack Omar (played by Gordon Warnecke). He is a south Asian guy of Pakistani extraction whose wealthy, worldly uncle has put him in charge of one of his laundrettes, one of a string of faintly dodgy business interests. But there is a complication: Johnny and Omar are lovers, and their relationship finds a kind of ironic symbol in the laundrette that may yet get turned into an unlikely thing of beauty. And so the film unexpectedly and subversively taps into the new Thatcherite enthusiasm for small-business entrepreneurialism (it was a time when Thatcher\u2019s Enterprise Allowance Scheme, while undoubtedly intended to keep unemployment figures low, was taken up by many in the leftie arts world).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Cusack (right) in The Grifters. Photograph: Allstar/Palace Films\n\n2. The Grifters (1990)\n\nA modern classic about con artists, this also stars Cusack and is adapted by Donald Westlake from the novel by pulp master Jim Thompson, but finds something a little softer and more emollient than might otherwise be the case for Thompson (less shocking, for example, than his The Killer Inside Me). Cusack plays Roy, a small-time confidence trickster whose mother (and fellow con artist) Lilly, played by Angelica Huston, takes an instant dislike to Roy\u2019s new girlfriend Myra (Annette Bening). This emotional triangulation is the driving force behind calamitous new criminal complications, involving an awful psychological disclosure. In some ways, the most devastating moment comes with Roy\u2019s first misjudgment: a silly little scam to trick bartenders out of high-denomination bills winds up with him getting punched in the stomach by his intended victim with shocking ferocity. When a cop stops to ask the hunched-over Roy if he is all right, Roy obviously can\u2019t say what\u2019s happened and, suppressing gasps of agony has to make light of it, claiming to have food poisoning: a symbol of the self-destructive and dishonest denial that has been going on his whole life.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Judi Dench and Steve Coogan in 2013\u2019s Philomena.\n\nPhotograph: Alex Bailey/Allstar/BBC Films\n\n1. Philomena (2013)\n\nFrears\u2019 chef-d\u2019oeuvre has everything: accessibly rooted in a true story, it has a powerful but controlled display of emotions, is tempered with poignancy and wit, and has great performances from stars and supporting cast. Judi Dench gives one of her best ever performances as Philomena Lee, a tough Irish woman who is on a mission to find out what happened to the baby boy that was taken from her when she became pregnant in the 1950s and was sent to one of Ireland\u2019s notorious \u201cMagdalene laundries\u201d. These were workhouse-style homes for unwed young mothers that allowed childless Catholic couples from the United States to come and adopt the wretched women\u2019s babies in return for a cash donation to the church (naturally, the mothers themselves were not allowed a say in the matter). In effect, a machine for turning shame into money. Steve Coogan plays Martin Sixsmith, the former journalist and New Labour spin doctor who has recently endured a shame of his own relating to a leaked email. It is Sixsmith who helps Philomena on her mission to confront the arrogant hypocrisy of the church. Dench gives a lovely performance as Philomena and Coogan \u2013 whose acting skills are often undervalued \u2013 is excellent as well. It is a film with all the components for a Frears gem, and the most important is heart. Its compassion and tenderness radiate from the screen.\n\n", "author": ["Peter Bradshaw"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/apr/15/stuck-at-home-seven-inspiring-tips-to-stay-connected", "published": "2020-04-15T14:38:50", "title": "Stuck at home?

Photograph: Lumina/Stocksy United\n\nLockdown could have seen us wallowing in some pretty unusual hermetic behaviour. Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.\n\nInstead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we\u2019re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.\n\nEvery day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it\u2019s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we\u2019re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here\u2019s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.\n\nHave cyber happy hour with your friends\n\nThe shutters might be closed on the nation\u2019s pubs, but that hasn\u2019t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of cr\u00e8me de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there\u2019s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.\n\nOnline rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

Quarantine quizzes have flourished, too (check out Edinburgh-based Goose\u2019s Quizzes on Twitch), along with online book clubs: Yiyun Li\u2019s #TolstoyTogether sees the author lead fellow bibliophiles in a daily War and Peace reading. Feeling cheeky? Try gatecrashing one of the growing number of nuptials and other parties held online. Hundreds of people tuned in to watch 13-year-old London schoolboy Jude Cannon\u2019s bar mitzvah in his parents\u2019 living room after his original one was cancelled, while in China one wedding was livestreamed to 3 million people.

To help the 1.2 million subscribers doing PE with Wicks each morning, internet providers such as Vodafone are flexing to provide the powerful network we rely on to keep our kids active. Domestic dancing has also taken off: see Fame legend Debbie Allen\u2019s Instagram Live lessons (one recent light-the-sky-up-like-a-flame workout attracted 34,000 people), or the English National Ballet\u2019s Tamara Rojo\u2019s Facebook classes.\n\nOnline rendezvous: Fitness app Urban offers private, livestreamed classes (in yoga, physiotherapy, mindfulness and personal training), pairing you with a self-employed professional whose livelihood may have been affected by the pandemic.\n\nCo-watch cinema\n\nIn recent weeks, Netflix Party, the Chrome extension that allows groups of friends to watch and comment on series and movies together, at the same time, has turned television into a communal activity again: something that only happens at Christmas or during the World Cup. Its live chat room might be the digi-equivalent of the crisp-packet-rustler down your local multiplex, but there\u2019s no better way to laugh, comment and discuss the intricacies of Joe Exotic\u2019s mullet en masse.\n\nOnline rendezvous: With many Hollywood films getting early digital releases, a number of stars are hosting interactive events.

Master the oboe? Speak the Cyrillic alphabet from A to \u042f? There\u2019s never been a better time to pick up new skills as specialists everywhere dispense their wisdom via one-on-one video tuition. A quick online search should throw up a willing tutor for whatever whimsy you have, whether it\u2019s cake decorating, choir practice or Colombian cookery. Meanwhile, InterPals, My Language Exchange and Italki pairs anybody eager to learn a language with a native speaker on Skype or FaceTime.\n\nOnline rendezvous: Over on Zoom, Cocktails After Dark features out-of-work bartenders teaching viewers how to make drinks (plus earning much-needed tips in the process).

Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York\u2019s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites. Wildlife fans can ogle webcams showing brown bears emerging from hibernation in Alaska\u2019s Katmai National Park, majestic pachyderms and other charismatic megafauna at South Africa\u2019s Tembe Elephant Park, or sea otters sploshing around at Monterey Bay Aquarium.\n\nOnline rendezvous: The Scandi trend for slow TV is seemingly tailor-made for these trapped-inside times.

Whether we\u2019re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from \u201cnice to have\u201d to the lifeline between us and the outside world.\n\nFor some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar \u2026\n\nRosie: \u2018I haven\u2019t seen my son in four weeks\u2019\n\n\u201cDropping my son off with his father without knowing when I\u2019m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn\u2019t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old; he\u2019s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment \u2013 to hell with it all.\n\n\u201cI have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I\u2019ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been four weeks already, which is the longest I\u2019ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well \u2013 I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he\u2019ll hug the phone he\u2019s using.\n\n\u201cHe recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he\u2019s being \u2018independent\u2019. He\u2019s learned quite a few new words \u2013 I\u2019m really proud of him. He\u2019s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we\u2019re reunited.\n\n\u201cWe talk at breakfast and dinner \u2013 it\u2019s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also had some family group calls \u2013 we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!\u201d\n\n\n\nLeo: \u2018I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.\n\n\u201cAs the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn\u2019t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I\u2019m used to seeing her every few days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.\n\n\u201cMy symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it\u2019s best that she stays at her mum\u2019s until I\u2019m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don\u2019t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn\u2019t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.\n\n\u201cIt has been very hard to be away from her; especially because we don\u2019t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven\u2019t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.\n\n\u201cLoneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.\n\n\u201cWe chat about what we\u2019re doing, laugh about how mad we\u2019re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.\u201d\n\nMark: \u2018We haven\u2019t told my daughter I\u2019m back in the UK yet\u2019\n\n\u201cI travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family \u2013 but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn\u2019t be stranded.\n\n\u201cAfter discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn\u2019t come straight back to the family home and \u2013 as a precaution \u2013 I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.\n\nNeed help with home schooling? 12 of the best apps if you\u2019re teaching kids in lockdown Read more\n\n\u201cHowever, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn\u2019t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she\u2019s been scared of things she\u2019s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn\u2019t want to worry her even more.\n\n\u201cEvery day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I\u2019m away, and it\u2019s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she\u2019s coping and reassure her that I\u2019ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we\u2019ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.\u201d\n\nVodafone #KeepingtheUKConnected\n\nWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.\n\nThat\u2019s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

All CBeebies apps get the educational thumbs up, but we love Go Explore for the way it helps kids expand their world, and Storytime for building early reading and comprehension skills.\n\nCosmic Kids, free trial\n\nSure, learning your ABC is important, but it\u2019s equally vital to teach children how to deal with the uncomfortable emotions they might be feeling because they\u2019re stuck indoors and unable to see friends and family. Step forward this 100% kid-friendly yoga and mindfulness app where they can learn how to calm and centre themselves while having serious laughs with everything from Frozen themes to fluffy dogs. Now, that\u2019s smart.\n\nPinterest, free\n\nThere\u2019s endless play-based brain food on here, from craft ideas that encourage fine motor skills (Cheerios caterpillar, anyone?), to tips for using Lego to introduce basic maths concepts. Save your favourite ideas and you\u2019ll never be short of a toolkit of fun screen-free games to play.\n\nKey stage 1\n\nTeach Your Monster to Read, 99p\n\nFlummoxed by phonics? This app helps your children continue where they left off and it even has the stamp of approval from the Department for Education. Covering the first two years of learning to read, from matching letters and sounds to enjoying small books, the joyful little monster of the app\u2019s title will help your child sidestep common reading stumbling blocks.\n\nSqueebles Spelling Test, \u00a33.99\n\nLet us count the ways we love this app. First up, it allows you to customise spelling tests using the words your own child finds tricky, or, if you prefer, you can simply download one of 100 pre-recorded tests based on the national curriculum. Second, it\u2019s suitable for every level and is awash with nifty options, including dyslexic-friendly fonts. And last but not least, children love rescuing their little Squeeble from the spelling snake and earning motivating stars along the way. A win-win.\n\nMaths Rockx, \u00a39.99\n\nThere\u2019s nothing yawnsome or rote here: your kids will be nailing numbers by singing along to classic tunes from the likes of One Direction, Pink, Pharrell Williams and more. Kitchen disco, anyone?\n\nKey stage 2\n\nRoblox, free\n\nThis collection of online multiplayer games and virtual worlds has a Learn & Explore option to point parents \u2013 and children \u2013 towards games that educate in a way that\u2019s fun. Children can explore the Roblox History Museum with their friends, learning as they go about everything from mammals to human psychology. If they brave the Digestive System Adventure, groups of budding scientists can discover the ins and outs of the body\u2019s waste disposal system. And there\u2019s more, with time on their hands, children can learn how to code and even find out how to design their own games.\n\nDuolingo, free\n\nThis app will help your child nail any of 30 languages. Best of all, it\u2019s a doddle to use, with rewarding short daily sessions (and handy reminders) that will help your children build that all-important love of learning. Tr\u00e8s bon.\n\nSecondary school\n\nForest: App store, \u00a31.99; Play store, free\n\nAs every parent knows, the biggest problem with secondary school children isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t have enough work to do, it\u2019s getting them off TikTok/Fortnite/YouTube long enough to get it done. The idea here is simple: the app has a picture of a tree and the longer they stay on their school task, the taller the tree will grow. If they pick up their phone to check Snapchat? Yup, its days are numbered. Better still, they can buddy up with pals to plant trees together, helping them collectively go from procrastinators to productivity machines.\n\nFender play, free for limited period\n\nIf music lessons have gone out the window, this app is the next best thing to live tutoring. Learn the guitar, bass or ukulele in bite-sized lessons, and get a heap of video inspiration from musicians and instructors.

Why not encourage the family to listen when they\u2019re out and about on their daily walks, making use of unlimited data plans on mobiles? The Ted-Ed video-based lessons are no different, featuring experts and teachers who excel in their field. From how soap kills the coronavirus to the tricks used to build tunnels underwater, there are countless compelling lessons to choose from. If only there was one that would teach the kids how to load the dishwasher.\n\nVodafone #KeepingtheUKConnected\n\nConnecting with teachers, schools and the world of education has rarely been more important for families.\n\nThat\u2019s why every day we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network. So even when we\u2019re apart, nothing can stop us being together.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more \u2026 with so many of us keen to use the extra time indoors to learn a new skill, we at Vodafone are making it easier than ever.

Spotting them is one way to identify common species, but why not try learning their songs, too?

Its song is deep and fluty in tone, and very measured in pace and rhythm.\n\nListen here to the blackbird\n\nSong thrush\n\nThe classic thrush, with brown back and spotted breast. Its song consists of repeated phrases, as if the bird is conducting a one-sided conversation.\n\nListen here to the song thrush\n\nRobin\n\nUnmistakable, perky and plump with that famous red breast \u2013 both males and females. The song is delicate and measured, with each phrase followed by a pause.\n\nListen here to the robin\n\nDunnock\n\nOnce called the hedge sparrow, the dunnock is dark greyish-purple and brown, with a thin bill. Its song is a rather unremarkable series of warbling notes.\n\nListen here to the dunnock\n\nWren\n\nTiny, plump and chestnut-brown, with a cocked tail and short, whirring wings.

In fact, its cult status is on the rise. Despite having been primetime Friday-night viewing for seven years, The Golden Girls does not currently have the binge-watching availability of, say, Friends, because it is not available on streaming platforms such as Netflix (although you can buy past series on iTunes and Amazon).\n\nInstead, the current influx of fans get their fix via Instagram, where Golden Girls has been hash-tagged more than 600,000 times on accounts such as Golden Girls Daily and Golden Girls Love, which are approaching 50,000 followers each. Some episodes have been uploaded to YouTube, and the revival took a further step into the mainstream when Golden Girls backgrounds were recently made available for the video conferencing app Zoom.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hot property: The Golden Girls Monopoly board game\n\nYou can also buy Golden Girls-themed everything, from Monopoly, Cluedo and Trivial Pursuit, to Pez dispensers, action figures and even breakfast cereal.

Sex toys are a way of having connection with yourself when everything is falling apart.\u201d\n\nBryony Cole, the chief executive of Future of Sex, has also seen a \u201c30% to 40%\u201d rise in sales. \u201cWe all deal with this [isolation] in different ways,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people organise their pantries, other people are masturbating morning and night.\u201d\n\nWhy sex toys? Why now?\n\nIso for many singles is the equivalent of a sexual ice age. For those who have tried virtual dating, the experience can be frustrating, Floro says. \u201cSex toys can be a way of getting sexual satisfaction while your real-life sex life is on hold,\u201d she explains.\n\nCole says: \u201cPeople can virtually date but people are very fatigued \u2013 they are all Zoomed out. There have been enough weeks now after the initial excitement when there were all these virtual dates.\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s the feeling of uncertainty as the weeks progress. This may go on for six months and it\u2019s like, \u2018Do I want to chat to this person for six months and maybe not even have sex?\u2019\u201d\n\nChantelle Otten, an accredited sex therapist and relationship expert, who works with sex toy brand LoveHoney, says it\u2019s natural to be intimated by sex toys if you are a first-time user. \u201cIt is important to remember that sex toys are designed to be an extension of your sexual potential and [to] try something different in the bedroom.\u201d\n\nCole adds: \u201cI hope people are using this time to explore their sexuality.\u201d She says it\u2019s also a great time to \u201cexplore your body with your own hands. You don\u2019t necessarily need tech.\u201d\n\nWhat if you\u2019re isolating with your partner?\n\n\u201cSex toys aren\u2019t just for self-pleasure, but can help couples discover new ways to connect to maximise their intimacy levels,\u201d Otten says.\n\nSelf-isolating, says Cole, is \u201ca chance to deepen our relationship ... How can we use tech that allows us a better way to connect without disappearing into the screen?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bryony Cole, chief executive of Future of Sex, which has seen a 30% to 40% rise in sales of sex toys. Photograph: Andras Grausz\n\nThe demand is not just for sex toys but anything to get couples out of an intimacy rut and \u201cto encourage everyone to have more sex whilst stuck at home\u201d.\n\nFrom her iso bolthole just outside Melbourne, Cole has developed a website and game called Wheel of Foreplay that provides sexual suggestions, moves and games for couples in isolation, those in long-distance or sexting relationships, and \u201ceven people on their first virtual date\u201d.\n\nShe says sex toys and her Wheel of Foreplay game allow people to \u201cuse this time to connect more and go deeper\u201d.\n\nFloro says: \u201cWith your partner, introducing a vibrator into the bedroom is a great tool. It\u2019s not meant to replace your partner, it\u2019s something to enhance sex.\u201d\n\nLove in the time of corona: 'This wasn't how I planned it, but she said yes' Read more\n\nShe advises couples to \u201chave a conversation and frame it in a way that is not emasculating. Like anything to do with sex, it comes down to communication every single time. If they are open to trying new things they are a keeper.\u201d\n\nShopping for toys online together can encourage communication within couples, says Otten. \u201cBefore bringing sex toys into the bedroom, have an open conversation with your partner \u2026 see what you both like the look of and would like to try.\u201d\n\nWhat if you need to be discreet?\n\nNot everyone is isolating alone or with sexual partners. Some are negotiating lockdown life with roommates, or \u2013 for the ultimate in potential embarrassment \u2013 parents. So is it possible to bring in toys stealthily?\n\nFloro says after your toy has arrived in the mail (they are usually always posted in plain outer packaging) \u201cyou\u2019ve got to plan\u201d when to use it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a lot of privacy, she advises buying a waterproof vibrator so you can \u201cuse it in the shower. Or investing in a quiet vibrator \u2013 not something that\u2019s going to drill you into a wall\u201d.\n\n\n\nBut one of the greatest risks for noise comes from the user, not the toy. \u201cBe aware of your sounds, be aware if you\u2019re a moaner,\u201d Floro says. \u201cYour doona is your best friend.\u201d That is, use under bedding that may muffle any telling groans.\n\nOtten recommends extra-quiet sex toys: \u201cNo vibrator will ever be completely silent but whisper-quiet vibrators are made from materials that muffle the noise and are engineered to have quieter motors.\n\n\u201cIn terms of specific toys, a good discreet toy to start with is a clitoral stimulator. One like the Mantric Rechargeable Clitoral Vibrator is powerful but also extremely quiet with seven silent settings, for those who are self-isolating in sharing a house with family or housemates.\u201d\n\nWhat if you\u2019re on a budget?\n\nFloro advises to stay away from toys with \u201ccrazy patterns\u201d and instead \u201clook for intensity ranging from one to five, look for medical-grade silicon and a really great make. You could start with a bullet vibrator ranging from $30 to $50.\u201d\n\nPolyamory in a pandemic: who do you quarantine with when you're not monogamous? Read more\n\nOtten says: \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to keep things on a budget, females can get basic bullet vibrators and clitoral vibrators for as little as $9.95. Male sex toys start around the $14.95 mark. However, if you\u2019re a first-timer, with sex toys it\u2019s often worth spending a little more and investing in one with multiple functions so you can spend time exploring what you like.\u201d\n\nHow about hygiene?\n\nWith cleanliness at the top of everyone\u2019s minds, keeping your new toy clean should be no different. \u201cYou should be using soap and water to clean them \u2013 definitely keep them clean,\u201d Floro says.\n\nApart from that, just make sure you follow general hygiene advice \u2013 in all things you do \u2013 whether it\u2019s masturbating or going to the supermarket. Wash your hands often and keep to social distancing guidelines with those outside your household.\n\n\n\n", "author": ["Brigid Delaney"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/have-you-been-affected-coronavirus-anywhere-but-westminster", "published": "2020-04-11T09:46:30", "title": "Have you been directly affected by coronavirus?", "text": "For our next episode of Anywhere but Westminster we would like to hear from you\n\nAs the Guardian\u2019s Anywhere but Westminster video series continues about life in the coronavirus crisis, we want to hear from people directly affected by the illness itself.\n\nDo you have the virus right now, and are you enduring self-isolation?

Protesters clogged the streets for a mile in every direction; they went all the way up to the National Monument and beyond it to the presidential palace. It was 4 November 2016, and they had come on buses, planes and on foot, from all across Java and even from some other islands, to participate in the largest Islamist demonstration in Indonesian history.\n\n\u201cWe came to the palace to enforce the law,\u201d said the cleric Rizieq Shihab, to rapt silence. \u201cDesecrators of the Qur\u2019an must be punished. We must reject the leaders of infidels,\u201d he said, referring to Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the Chinese-Christian governor of Indonesia\u2019s capital city, who is known as Ahok. \u201cIf our demands are not heard, are you ready to turn this into a revolution?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re ready!\u201d screamed the crowd, breaking into huge applause. \u201cGod is great!\u201d, they shouted. There were cries of \u201cKill Ahok!\u201d\n\nIt was an odd scene in Indonesia, which is the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority country but is not really a \u201cMuslim nation\u201d. Officially, it is a multifaith country that protects six religions equally, where race and ethnicity have been tacitly elided from political discourse. An overtly Islamist political protest like this had no precedent.\n\nIn theory, the rally was organised by the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), led by Shihab, to accuse Ahok of blasphemy against Islam and call for his removal from office. But in practice, this was less about Ahok and more about displaying the piety and political power of Muslim Indonesians \u2013 and it worked. The city shut down all its major arteries that day. At the second protest, on 2 December, the president of Indonesia himself showed up, unannounced, and prayed with them.\n\nFPI\u2019s campaign was more successful than it could have dreamed. The following April, Ahok lost his bid for re-election as the governor of Jakarta; a month later, at the end of a show trial, he was sentenced to two years in jail for blasphemy. The 4 November rally turned out to be a turning point for political Islam in Indonesia. The next presidential election was waged largely on the terms set by the events of 2016: both candidates played up their Islamic credentials. Today, the vice-president of Indonesia is a man who was once the nation\u2019s chief Muslim cleric.\n\nBut Shihab is not enjoying the fruits of his labour in Indonesia. He lives, instead, in Saudi Arabia. After the Jakarta gubernatorial election, he became embroiled in a sexting scandal; when an arrest warrant was issued, he fled to Mecca. Though it is almost 5,000 miles away from Indonesia, the kingdom is a natural choice of refuge for Shihab, because his Saudi ties date back three decades. He graduated from the Islamic and Arabic College of Indonesia, or Lipia, a university in Jakarta built, funded and fully subsidised to this day by Saudi Arabia. His studies at Lipia paved the way for further education in Riyadh, where he forged enduring networks with Saudi clerics.\n\nAs the largest Muslim-majority nation and a developing, postcolonial state, Indonesia has been a prime recipient of the full spectrum of Saudi proselytisation \u2013 known as dawa, the call to Islam. And while investments peaked in absolute terms at least a decade ago, as they did in most of the Muslim world, their effects continue to reverberate. Saudi investment in Indonesia has at turns fuelled jihadists, helped consolidate the country\u2019s leading Islamist political party and produced dozens of influential ideologues. The Saudi soft-power apparatus in Indonesia is unrivalled, including Lipia, a large embassy and a powerful, standalone \u201creligious attache\u201d. Saudi charity has also paid for thousands of poor students to go to school and university, and helped rebuild devastated regions such as Aceh after the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004.\n\nThe influence of Shihab\u2019s organisation and vision is just one example of how Saudi dawa has shaped modern Indonesia. Another is the Bali bombings of 2002, which killed 202 people, mostly tourists, in the world\u2019s most deadly terror attack after 9/11, and which woke Indonesia up to the danger of terrorism within its borders. The attacks were planned by a circle of al-Qaida-affiliated jihadists based at the al-Mukmin Islamic boarding school in Central Java, which was founded with an initial endowment from the Saudi king in 1972.\n\nBeyond such flagship investments, an equally pervasive legacy of Saudi proselytisation in Indonesia has been the rise of virulent religious intolerance. In addition to the commonplace harassment of Christian groups and the show trial of Ahok, its most prominent Christian politician, Indonesia is also now a country where there is a national \u201canti-Shia\u201d league and mobs have driven Ahmadiyya Muslims from their homes into refugee camps.\n\nIt\u2019s not for nothing that when Barack Obama, who spent five years in Jakarta as a child, returned to Indonesia in 2011, he remarked on the \u201cmore fundamentalist, unforgiving interpretation\u201d of Islam he now observed in the archipelago. He attributed this to Saudi influence. What Obama was picking up on was the concept of Arabisasi \u2013 ambitious in theory and even more influential in practice.\n\nArabisasi was one of the first Indonesian words I learned after I moved to the country in 2016. It\u2019s a neologism meaning, as you might expect, \u201cArabisation\u201d. But the concept was used in reference to a whole class of developments in Indonesia: the rise of political Islam, blasphemy prosecutions, the growing popularity of hijabs and burqas, new mosques, louder mosques, new schools, the persecution of religious minorities. Above all, it referred to the relatively new, central role for Islam in the cultural and political life of a big democracy that was, until 1998, a tightly controlled military dictatorship. The underlying claim was that five decades of Saudi Arabia\u2019s religious influence in Indonesia was responsible for all these things.\n\nRegardless of how true or false this was, the phrase itself pointed to a generalised anxiety over \u201cSaudi money\u201d, in Indonesia and the world. It seemed to explain how a tropical archipelago supposedly famous for its tolerance was, by the time I got there, caught up in a culture war over everything from the acceptability of Santa hats to dating, a safe haven for hardline Islamists, and even the home of a few hundred people who joined Islamic State.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s global export of Wahhabism \u2013 a puritanical and intolerant movement founded in the 18th century that foregrounds a literal reading of the Qur\u2019an and seeks to eradicate \u201cdeviant\u201d regional traditions \u2013 has been discussed frequently in the post-9/11 world, where religious conservatism is often considered synonymous with extremism and terrorism. But the actual effects of Saudi proselytisation are poorly understood. It\u2019s not just \u201cthe Saudi government\u201d that spreads Wahhabism; international Saudi actors include universities, an Islamic Affairs state ministry, several state-adjacent global charities such as the Muslim World League, one-off regional relief efforts and independent businessmen.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rizieq Shihab, the leader of the Indonesian hardline Muslim group FPI. Photograph: Adek Berry/AFP/Getty\n\nDawa literally means to call or invite, but in practice it covers the wide range of proselytisation activities available to any Muslim person or institution. Today, there is official Saudi dawa in two dozen countries, and unofficial activity in many more. Its effects are not straightforward. For instance, Saudi dawa typically ends up promoting not Saudi Wahhabism, but Salafism, a linked but discrete 20th-century revivalist movement, originating in Egypt, that seeks to return to the traditions of earliest Islam. Saudi proselytisation tends to cultivate a learned Salafi class of scholars and ideologues who then go on to shape their local religious landscapes. Another common outcome is the violent intolerance of Shia and Sufi Muslims, as well as minority sects such as the Ahmadiyya and other religions such as Christianity. The most notorious effect has been the spread of Salafi-jihadism, which has found a base in some of the communities supported by Saudi dawa.\n\nThe Saudi dawa project has been an effort to systematically shape the Muslim world, and Muslims in the world, in its image. In its ambition and global reach, it is unparalleled. It is also chaotic and full of contradictions: Saudi efforts both support and work to counter Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political Islamists, or simultaneously fund shady charities and counter-extremism centres that work within miles of each other.\n\nSaudi Arabia didn\u2019t single-handedly cause the conservative turn in Indonesia, not by a long shot. But what I learned in three years was that it has indeed contributed to it in all sorts of ways. When I travelled through much of the Indonesian archipelago, from Aceh to Sulawesi, I was surprised by the Saudi campaign\u2019s scale and precision in its targeted outreach to regional leaders. What struck me, too, was the characteristic Saudi vision of combining aid and proselytisation. The line between the two was always blurred.\n\nIslam came to the Indonesian archipelago around the 13th century, likely through Arab traders, and the powerful rulers of Java and Sumatra gradually converted from Hinduism or Buddhism to Islam. The islands of what is now Indonesia belonged to a larger archipelagic Muslim medieval world that included parts of modern-day Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Cambodia.\n\nIndonesia is still home to the world\u2019s largest Buddhist temple \u2013 Borobudur, in Central Java \u2013 many Hindu temples, millions of Christians who converted under colonial rule, and rich mystical and animist traditions. Many of these elements have coloured Indonesian Islam, which is not liberal exactly, but is still tolerant of many folk practices. To give just one example, there is a shrine in Central Java, on Mount Kemukus, which Muslim pilgrims climb to have sex with other pilgrims, who are complete strangers, above a graveyard, to bring good luck. The rite, which includes elements of Javanese myth and esoteric Hindu Tantra, could only exist in Indonesia.\n\nAfter Indonesia became independent in 1945, \u201cIndonesian Islam\u201d faced a high-stakes test: would the new country be Islamic? Would it enforce sharia? Ultimately, the founding fathers decided that it would not. But out of these vigorous postcolonial debates emerged a man named Mohammad Natsir, who would go on to almost single-handedly establish Saudi influence in the archipelago. Natsir was a pious Islamic scholar from Sumatra who became the first prime minister of independent Indonesia. In 1958, he joined an unsuccessful rebellion against the founding president Sukarno and went into exile deep in the Sumatran jungle for three years. When he emerged, he was promptly jailed. And when he was finally allowed to return to civil society in 1966, he was ignored and shunned by the new Suharto military dictatorship, which had just come to power through a violent, CIA-backed coup.\n\nBut Natsir didn\u2019t retire from public life. He was distressed by how Muslims were being denied a political voice in a new nation whose citizenry was about 90% Muslim. He resolved to target Indonesian hearts and minds, instead of their votes. \u201cWe are no longer preaching by means of politics, but engaging in politics through preaching,\u201d he said. What he meant was that he would cultivate grassroots Islamic activism instead of pushing for Islamic laws and political institutions. Saudi Arabia was delighted to help him do exactly that.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thousands of Indonesian Muslims had assembled a mass pray for tsunami-hit Aceh province at Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta in 2005. Photograph: Bay Ismoyo/AFP/Getty\n\nWhen the Saudi monarch King Faisal first visited Indonesia in 1967, he was deeply impressed by Natsir. At the time, Faisal was developing his vision of a Saudi foreign policy driven by al-tadamon al-Islami, or \u201cIslamic solidarity.\u201d He opened the kingdom\u2019s taps to Natsir, who promptly created Dewan Dakwah Islamiyah Indonesia (DDII), the Indonesian Islamic Dawa Council, which became the chief conduit for Saudi money into Indonesia. Natsir\u2019s personal diplomacy won him an open-ended tazkiya, or recommendation letter, from Mecca to accept donations from any Saudi source.\n\nToday, DDII is housed in an eight-storey, star-shaped building in Cikini in Central Jakarta, called the Dawa Tower. It still has offices in 32 of the 34 provinces of Indonesia. But active Saudi funding has dried up, and its revenues now come from the properties it owns through its charitable endowment. More than four decades after its founding, DDII has \u201cboth lost and won\u201d, says Ulil Abshar-Abdalla, a Muslim intellectual who lives in Jakarta. The organisation itself is less influential and well-funded than in the 1980s and 1990s \u2013 but its ideas are now ensconced in the mainstream.\n\nWhile DDII has always been administered by Indonesians, another important node of Saudi influence in Indonesia is staffed entirely by Saudis: Lipia university in South Jakarta. Lipia is the most visible outpost of Saudi dawa in Indonesia, and it is one of the greatest accomplishments of the peak dawa era worldwide. It is a bricks-and-mortar university completely administered by Saudis, and to this day overseen by the Saudi embassy. The university\u2019s website entices applicants today with free tuition, a monthly allowance and opportunities to pursue graduate degrees in Saudi Arabia. The classes are all conducted in Arabic. There is barely any Indonesian text visible on campus, even on signs. There are female students, but they study on a separate level from the male students and watch video lectures that are live-streamed from the male classrooms downstairs. Lipia has lately been trying to recruit more female instructors to change this, but as of 2019 they were still outnumbered at least three to one.\n\nAs one might expect, the books of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of Wahhabism, have always been a key part of Lipia\u2019s curriculum. But the curriculum was never purely Wahhabi, and in the 1990s, Lipia became a hotbed of Muslim Brotherhood-oriented political Islamists (as opposed to pure Salafis, who are apolitical). That\u2019s why the university became a prime recruiting spot for the Prosperous Justice party (PKS), which is modelled on the Muslim Brotherhood and is Indonesia\u2019s most successful Islamist political party. Some of Lipia\u2019s most influential alumni are members of the modern PKS, including former party president Hidayat Nur Wahid. Lipia\u2019s evolution makes it a microcosm of the multifaceted Saudi dawa project, harbouring both political Islamists and quietist Salafis \u2013 as well as plenty of poor students who just jumped at the chance for a scholarship.\n\nOne of the unlikeliest places where Salafism has thrived is Batam, a rather seedy resort island in a special duty-free economic zone, just across the bay from Singapore. The island has little to recommend it beyond tax-free shopping and cheap bars, but in the last 10 years it has also become home to a prominent Salafi radio station called Hang Radio and multiple Salafi boarding schools. I visited one of the schools, Pesantren Anshur al-Sunnah, in Batam\u2019s main Salafi neighbourhood of Cendana, in 2017. Its facilities are bare bones, but it educates more than 150 students from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The school\u2019s director, who studied in Medina on a scholarship, would only speak to me through a partitioned room, because he would not be in the presence of a woman who is not a relation.\n\nIn Batam\u2019s busy downtown, Hang Radio runs an impressive office and recording studio. The station is decades old, but it took a religious turn in 2004 when its owner, a local businessman named Zein Alatas, became a Salafi in a fit of mid-life piety. Now, it broadcasts 20 straight hours of religious content every day, including sermons by visiting clerics. In 2016, the island rejected 418 passport applications from residents who were suspected of intent to join Isis; Hang Radio was cited by local authorities as a factor behind the convicts\u2019 increasingly radical views.\n\nToday, Saudi dawa in Indonesia is decreasing in absolute terms; the Philippines is now its major target in south-east Asia, according to annual reports of the Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawa and Guidance. But Indonesian institutions have adjusted. After DDII\u2019s Gulf funding dried up, it was replaced in part by politicians such as Prabowo Subianto, a military general turned cabinet minister, who funded DDII throughout the 2000s. It is through such resilient institutions that Saudi influence survives. Every Saudi national could leave Indonesia tomorrow and there would still be a vibrant Salafi ecosystem in place.\n\nYet even though many Indonesian Salafis are standing on their own feet, there is still a tendency among Indonesian Muslims to idealise the traditions of the Gulf. Despite their great numerical advantage \u2013 there are more Muslims in the archipelago than in all the Gulf states combined \u2013 ideas rarely flow in the opposite direction. Indonesia\u2019s Sunni Muslim establishment has, over the last few years, tried to project \u201cIslam Nusantara\u201d, or \u201cIslam of the Archipelago\u201d, on the world stage, but it remains ideologically muddled, and leans on platitudes such as \u201cmoderation\u201d and \u201ctolerance\u201d.\n\nAs a result, Saudi Arabia\u2019s image retains great power in both the religious and non-religious spheres. Indonesian Salafi clerics frequently cite Saudi scholars in their rulings, and nearly all ordinary Muslims save up to visit Mecca and Medina. Within Indonesia\u2019s thriving Islamic-capitalist consumer economy, products depicting Mecca\u2019s Kaaba shrine, from clocks to calendars, are ubiquitous. I once bought iced tea from a woman in Manado, in North Sulawesi, whose hijab was simply embroidered with the word \u201cSaudi\u201d in cursive script: kingdom as brand and logo.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Students from an Islamic boarding school attend a Qur\u2019an recitation during Ramadan in Medan. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nAmid this general good will, Saudi Arabia has started to tweak the way it presents itself in Indonesia. The first Saudi ambassador I met in Jakarta, Osama bin Mohammed al-Shuaibi, in 2017, had a stern manner. Dressed in the traditional flowing thawb and checked red headdress, he grew angry when I asked him about the role of Wahhabism in Saudi diplomacy, and railed against what he saw as Iran\u2019s meddling overseas. But his successor Esam Althagafi, whom I met a week after his appointment in 2019, was both more forthcoming and more westernised. He wore a crisp navy suit and tie, and spoke perfect English.\n\n\u201cThe way we see it, Indonesia is a member of Vision 2030,\u201d Althagafi told me, referring to the plan by Muhammad bin Salman, the 34-year-old Saudi crown prince, to diversify the kingdom\u2019s economy away from oil and develop sectors such as health, culture and tourism. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the country\u2019s economy,\u201d Althagafi said. \u201cNot just religion.\u201d He even entertained my questions about Saudi proselytisation \u2013 while his predecessor was guarded, the new ambassador admitted that it was at the heart of the two countries\u2019 relationship.\u201d But today, we have nothing to hide,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything we do here, from Qur\u2019an competitions to Ramadan iftars, is at the request of Indonesian Muslim groups.\u201d Of course, Islamic affairs remain a priority, Althagafi told me. But he pointed out that the Saudi embassy was now ploughing resources into Arabic language programmes in Indonesia, positioning itself, in that respect, alongside cultural organisations such as the British Council and the Alliance Francaise.\n\n\u2018The Saudis couldn\u2019t do it without us\u2019: the UK\u2019s true role in Yemen\u2019s deadly war Read more\n\nGiven the obscure ways in which Saudi dawa has operated in the past, this change in rhetoric is notable. But there is very good reason to be sceptical about Vision 2030, which has been criticised for being economically unfeasible and for papering over human rights issues in order to burnish bin Salman\u2019s image. It is hard to believe in the supposed reformist promise of the prince and Vision 2030 when, midway through the publicity campaign in 2018, the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered in a Saudi consulate.\n\nIt will take at least a few years to determine whether the Saudi role in Indonesia has truly shifted. What is certain, though, is that over the past half-century, Saudi dawa has never been one fixed thing. Maintaining an ossified image from 10 or even 20 years ago is the biggest obstacle to understanding how Saudi money \u2013 and Saudi soft power \u2013 work today.\n\n\u2022 Adapted from The Call: Inside the Global Saudi Religious Project by Krithika Varagur, which will be published by Columbia Global Reports on 21 April\n\n\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "author": ["Krithika Varagur"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/opportunity-or-threat-how-islamic-extremists-reacting-coronavirus", "published": "2020-04-16T04:00:33", "title": "Opportunity or threat? How Islamic extremists are reacting to coronavirus", "text": "Groups such as Isis plan to exploit pandemic, but even it has acknowledged danger posed by virus\n\nIslamic extremists hope to exploit the Covid-19 pandemic to launch new attacks, motivate followers and reinforce their credentials as alternative rulers of swaths of unstable countries across the Middle East, Asia and Africa.\n\nBut the responses of different extremist groups have differed. While Islamic State has told its members to launch attacks against weakened and distracted western nations, the Taliban have released images of its public health teams, for example.\n\nExperts say the reaction to the pandemic has also evolved within extremist organisations, as its scale and threat has become better known.\n\nInitially, Isis gloated over Covid-19 in its magazine, al-Naba, describing the virus as a punishment for \u201cCrusader nations\u201d, and calling for strikes against the west as it reeled from the pandemic. However, more recent editions of the publication have carried lengthy articles saying it would be wrong for Muslims to believe they would be spared by the disease.\n\nThough editorials have continued to blame the US for a wave of atheism and immorality that has allegedly provoked punishment in the form of the pandemic, one al-Naba author stressed that similar outbreaks in the past had hit both the faithful and non-Muslims alike.\n\n\u201cThey are saying that the pandemic is definitely God\u2019s will but the intention behind it is unclear, so Muslims need to repent and \u2026 take measures not to catch or transmit [the virus],\u201d said Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, a researcher at the Program on Extremism at the George Washington University.\n\n\u201cIsis is recommending various health guidelines to its members and supporters \u2026 [and] also encouraging them to not show mercy to the western countries \u2026 but rather to continue to attack them, and exploit their weaknesses in these times.\u201d\n\nThough the group has recommended that members do not travel to western countries to launch attacks, it has said that those already present should act. On Wednesday, German police arrested four suspected members alleged to be planning to bomb US military facilities.\n\nProsecutors said the men joined Isis in January 2019 and were instructed to form a cell in Germany. Their alleged targets included US air force bases in the country and individuals deemed critical of Islam.\n\nIn contrast, al-Qaida issued six pages of advice and commentary on Covid-19 last week, arguing that though the virus had cast \u201ca gloomy, painful shadow over the entire world\u201d, the arrival of the pandemic in the Muslim world was a consequence of \u201cour own sins and \u2026 the obscenity and moral corruption \u2026 widespread in Muslim countries\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Medics gather as part of a show of support for healthcare workers and patients in Mosul, Iraq, on Tuesday. Photograph: Zaid Al-Obeidi/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe group, which has not launched attacks in the west for more than a decade, said the crisis was an opportunity \u201cto spread the correct creed, call people to jihad in the way of Allah and revolt against oppression and oppressors\u201d.\n\nThere are concerns the Coronavirus crisis could provide an opportunity for Islamic militants to win support as corrupt, inefficient and poorly resourced governments across Africa and the Middle East fail to provide adequate care for already distrustful populations. Islamist groups have repeatedly sought to exploit natural disasters in the past.\n\nFew countries hit badly by extremism have effective health systems and, though the full extent of the spread of the disease is difficult to gauge, many are likely to suffer acutely from the virus in coming weeks and months.\n\nMogadishu's refugees 'waiting for death' as Covid-19 reaches Somalia Read more\n\nRefugees and detainees \u2013 two communities already vulnerable to extremist recruitment \u2013 are particularly exposed to the new disease. Isis has recognised this, calling on fighters to make extra efforts to liberate imprisoned members of the group.\n\nIn Somalia, al-Shabaab held an urgent meeting two weeks ago to discuss the threat of the epidemic where senior commanders decided to tell Muslims to take precautions against the disease.\n\nAl-Shabaab, which controls swaths of territory and is fighting local government forces backed by US airstrikes and other African troops, blamed the disease on \u201cthe crusader forces who have invaded the country and the disbelieving countries that support them\u201d.\n\nAn al-Shabaab leader said the group rejoiced in the suffering of the US and its European allies.\n\n\u201cCoronavirus has uncovered the weakness of those who claimed to be superpowers such US, France, Italy, Germany and Britain,\u201d Fu\u2019ad Mohamed Khalaf told a congregation in a mosque in an al-Shabaab-controlled area of southern Somalia, according to the group\u2019s news channels.\n\nA spokesman for the group said it was too soon to comment on whether the group would heed a UN plea for a ceasefire or whether it would allow health workers to access areas it controlled.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban have said they will assist any humanitarian organisation that is helping victims of the virus or helping to stop its spread, and in some parts of the country have offered to cooperate with local authorities.\n\nThe Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed told the Associated Press news agency: \u201cIf, God forbid, the outbreak happens in an area where we control the situation, then we can stop fighting in that area.\u201d\n\nThe movement has also distributed images of Taliban medics distributing soap, masks and gloves in the eastern province of Nangarhar, and lecturing community leaders on precautions to stop the spread of the disease.\n\nThose groups that have shown little interest in winning the support of local communities are often those that have taken the hardest line.\n\nAbubakar Shekau, the leader of the Boko Haram breakaway faction of extremists in Nigeria, released an audio clip this week claiming that his brutal version of Islam was an \u201canti-virus\u201d and portraying social distancing measures that have closed mosques as an assault on the faith.\n\nAs well as providing an opportunity for militants, the pandemic may undermine the international effort against Islamist extremism, some experts say.\n\n\u201cIt is almost certainly correct that Covid-19 will handicap domestic security efforts and international counter-Isis cooperation, allowing the jihadists to better prepare spectacular terror attacks,\u201d the International Crisis Group said.\n\nThough analysts said it was too soon to point to attacks that could be blamed specifically on militants exploiting the coronavirus, Islamist extremists in late March carried out their deadliest assault yet against the military of Chad, a significant contributor to Africa\u2019s growing counterterrorism efforts. At least 92 soldiers were killed near the border with Nigeria and Niger.\n\nFighters affiliated to al-Qaida killed 29 soldiers in Mali on 19 March. An Islamist extremist group in northern Mozambique has also launched a series of attacks of unprecedented scale in recent weeks, while on Tuesday, a police officer and seven suspected militants were killed in an exchange of gunfire in central Cairo.\n\nIraq, where the pandemic has prompted the US-led coalition to halt training activities amid a planned pullout from several bases, has seen a surge in attacks by Isis in the last week.\n\nThere are signs elsewhere that the militaries of the US, Britain and other countries are also pulling back because of the virus, leaving a possible opening for the extremists.\n\nIn March, the US Africa Command cancelled two major exercises with African allies \u201cfor force protection considerations\u201d.

It was inspired by the international sanitary conferences of the 19th century set up to combat communicable diseases such as cholera, yellow fever and plague.\n\nIts current programme envisages expanding universal healthcare to a billion more people, protecting another billion from health emergencies and providing a further billion people with better health and wellbeing.\n\nWhat does that involve?\n\nIn practical terms, the badly underfunded WHO acts as a clearing house for investigation, data and technical recommendations on emerging disease threats such as the coronavirus and Ebola. It also supports eradication of existing diseases such as malaria and polio and promotes global public health.\n\nWhile its role on emerging diseases is most familiar in the developed world with its more resilient healthcare systems, its practical involvement is far more marked in the global south, where it has been working to expand basic healthcare, support vaccination and sustain weak and often stressed health systems through its emergencies programmes. Its 2018-9 budget was $4.8bn, which became $5.7bn when emergencies were included.\n\nWhy is the WHO under fire from Trump?\n\nTrump has presented the freezing of US funding to the WHO as a direct response to what he claims was its slow reaction in raising the alarm over the global threat from the coronavirus and being too \u201cChina-centric\u201d in its response. But the organisation\u2019s funding was already in his sights on 7 February, when his administration was suggesting cutting the US contribution, about $400m annually, by half as part of $3bn cuts to US global health funding across the board.\n\nThe WHO, to whom the US theoretically contributes roughly 10-15% of its budget as its largest contributor, has been appealing for an extra $1bn to help fight the coronavirus.\n\nPlay Video 1:34 Trump halts US payments to World Health Organization \u2013 video\n\nThe allegation by Trump and his supporters that the WHO was slow to warn of the risk of human-to-human transmission, and that it failed to cross-examine Chinese transparency early on, is largely not borne out by the evidence. WHO technical guidance issued in early January was warning of the risk of human-to-human transmission and the organisation declared coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern a day before Trump announced his partial ban on flights from China.\n\nInstead, it appears Trump is following a familiar playbook: finding others to blame amid his own handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has included calling it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, blaming the previous Obama administration and taking aim at state governors.\n\nHow does the WHO\u2019s performance in the coronavirus crisis compare with the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak?\n\nThe WHO, under the then-director general, Margaret Chan, was savaged from all sides for responding so slowly to an Ebola outbreak that began in a remote forested part of Guinea where the borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia were virtually non-existent. By the time the WHO acted, six months late, it had reached the dense cities.\n\nThe fallout for the WHO was serious and undermined its credibility. US critics suggested scrapping it and setting up a new global public health body, although the idea did not take off and President Obama did not support it. An independent report commissioned by Chan said the WHO\u2019s funding was inadequate and governments had not increased their contributions in years. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the current director general, and all other candidates for the role after Chan stood down pledged to reform its governance and funding.\n\nMost health experts agree the organisation under Tedros has performed much better over the coronavirus.\n\n\n\nHow big an impact will the US funding cuts have?\n\nWhile the suspension of funding by the US for 60-90 days is relatively small \u2013 not least because the US is so far in arrears in its annual payments \u2013 the potential for a general US withdrawal from global health funding under the cover of this announcement would be very serious and felt most profoundly in places that need the most support.\n\nEven before the Trump announcement, the organisation was looking at potential cuts to already underfunded programming. Such impacts could be felt in programmes already complicated by the coronavirus, such as vaccination for communicable diseases and in building up early warning systems and resilience to deal with diseases such as Ebola in African countries.\n\nDevi Sridhar, the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, called Trump\u2019s decision extremely problematic, noting that the WHO was leading efforts to help developing countries fight the spread of Covid-19. \u201cThis is the agency that\u2019s looking out for other countries and leading efforts to stop the pandemic. This is exactly the time when they need more funding, not less,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat other impacts will there be?\n\nTrump\u2019s assault on the reliability of WHO data and early warning systems, in pursuit of his own agenda against China, threatens its leadership role.

Helping them prevent disaster is not only right, he suggests, but in our own interests; so long as infection lingers anywhere in the world, it will keep coming back to countries who think they have beaten it. \u201cThis is not some abstract globalist thing,\u201d he says. \u201cNone of us are going to be properly safe until all countries are free of this.\u201d\n\nSo, what does he make of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw funding from the World Health Organization (WHO) mid-pandemic, seen in some quarters as an attempt to distract from the president\u2019s handling of the outbreak in the US?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illogical, it is counter-productive, it\u2019s really sabotaging the efforts to coordinate global health and it\u2019s an act of self-harm because it will rebound to hurt America,\u201d he says, bluntly. \u201cIf the next wave of the virus comes out of Africa because the WHO and others have not been able to help them contain and suppress the disease, then no doubt President Trump will blame Africa and demonise them as well as the WHO.\u201d Yet he hopes the US may still fund some arm\u2019s length WHO initiatives on coronavirus, and insists he hasn\u2019t given up on a global response: \u201cI still don\u2019t rule out getting countries round the world to bring China and America back into cooperation.\u201d\n\nBrown has persuaded more than 200 ex-leaders and ministers, economists and medical experts to back detailed proposals for global cooperation that he hopes will make the agenda of this week\u2019s meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. The open letter they have signed calls for a global pledging conference where governments could collectively agree to fund the search for a vaccine, treatments, ventilators and personal protective equipment worldwide. Instead of competing for scarce stocks, Brown wants countries to cooperate in boosting supply for all. \u201cI\u2019ve got no doubt if there was greater global coordination you could solve many of the problems that we face in this country \u2013 but also other countries are facing \u2013 about the lack of test kits, the lack of protective clothing, the lack of ventilators.\u201d\n\nThe letter also calls for a taskforce of the G20 group of powerful nations to agree assistance for developing countries, plus joint interventions to stop a global recession becoming a 1930s-style depression.\n\n\u201cThe fear people have is that a liquidity crisis in companies becomes a solvency crisis, and a recession becomes a depression and that\u2019s what we have got to avoid,\u201d says Brown. \u201cAction can be taken to minimise the number of weeks and months the economy is closed down, or at least partially closed down, but the international action is important.\u201d The economic repercussions of the virus are, he thinks, \u201cbigger than the global financial crisis and there\u2019s no doubt that they are as big in some countries as the Great Depression\u201d.\n\nHe flatly refuses to criticise Boris Johnson\u2019s handling of the epidemic, from shortages of protective clothing to the timing of lockdown. But isn\u2019t his letter tacit recognition that current leaders are failing? He sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look back on what decisions have been made, I want to look forward to see what decisions could be made in the future. We aren\u2019t trying to criticise, we are trying to encourage.\u201d The convalescing prime minister, he insists, has his sympathy. \u201cI feel sorry for Boris Johnson, because at the moment, when the greatest call upon executive action is being made, he\u2019s found himself out of it. That must be very frustrating and very sad.\u201d Asked if he\u2019s in touch with Johnson, his stand-in, Dominic Raab, or Sunak, Brown says only that he\u2019s \u201ctalking to people who are in touch with the decision-making in government\u201d.\n\nIsn\u2019t he frustrated, lacking the power to do what he feels needs doing? A burst of laughter, which I suspect disguises a yes, rolls down the line. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few ideas that might be able to be helpful, but I\u2019m not claiming anything else.\u201d\n\nYet this strikes closer to home than he cares to admit. It\u2019s when I ask how he is coping personally with lockdown that he momentarily falters. \u201cFor me it\u2019s uh \u2026 you know, we had to protect our son so we had to take action quite quickly.\u201d Gordon and Sarah Brown\u2019s son Fraser, 13, has the lung condition cystic fibrosis and government advice is to shield sufferers from the virus. It is a sensitive subject, the Browns guard the boys\u2019 privacy fiercely (they also have an older son, 16-year-old John). Brown doesn\u2019t want to discuss how this affects his political mission, but eventually says gruffly: \u201cWhat I do know is all of us have had to deal with a crisis at one point in our life, so you do feel whenever there\u2019s a crisis you have got to act quickly. That\u2019s what\u2019s motivating me at the moment.\u201d\n\nWe are on safer ground discussing the books getting him through lockdown. He\u2019s just ordered the novelist Linda Grant\u2019s latest (he found her 2000 book When I Lived in Modern Times, the story of a Jew from the East End of London moving to what was then Palestine, \u201camazing\u201d) and is ploughing through policy proposals to retrain people out of work during lockdown. At 68, he scoffs at the notion of retiring: \u201cNobody retires now!\u201d\n\nBut nor does Brown crave a comeback. When he surfaced on the BBC\u2019s Today programme in March, a wave of nostalgia surged through Twitter and he got some \u201cvery generous\u201d messages from the public. But while Tony Blair remains a political player, Brown doesn\u2019t regret leaving London to live quietly in his old constituency of Dunfermline East after losing the 2010 election.\n\n\u201cI used to say my best advice is not to take my advice,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI\u2019ve not involved myself in business or anything else and I\u2019ve not interfered in the Labour party. I\u2019ve just tried to do what I can to help various causes. I don\u2019t think former leaders should claim any special privileges or insights. There may be occasions when your experience is of use but you should be modest enough to realise that you\u2019ve got a new group of leaders and it\u2019s their time.\u201d He has discussed his proposals with Labour\u2019s new leader, Keir Starmer, but \u201cit\u2019s up to him to decide what he wants to do. I wish him well. I think he\u2019s an excellent choice.\u201d\n\nHe tweeted that Starmer\u2019s was the team that could return Labour to power, so why does he think Starmer can succeed where Jeremy Corbyn failed? \u201cBecause Keir\u2019s very good,\u201d he begins, before spotting the trap and declining to discuss domestic politics.\n\nWhy does he think countries have been initially slow to cooperate against coronavirus? \u201cIn the first few years after 2010 there was a sort of defensive nationalism \u2013 protectionism, tariffs, building walls, people putting import controls down. I think in the last year or two, it\u2019s been a more aggressive nationalism,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with an atmosphere that is a problem. But I think people have got to stop re-running the debate between globalists and nationalists. This is about saving lives.\u201d\n\nBrown reckons a moratorium on debt interest repayments owed by the poorest countries could, for example, release \u00a340bn for health and social protection. \u201cThat\u2019s almost a decision that if you made today, the countries could act on it tomorrow.\u201d But some will surely need IMF bailouts, reliant on richer countries\u2019 willingness to finance them.\n\nDuring the banking crisis, Brown was working 20-hour days, knowing that if his recapitalisation plan failed and banking collapsed then anarchy could follow. What advice can he give leaders operating now under similar pressure? \u201cFor me, it was a huge challenge. You know people didn\u2019t always agree with the way I did it ... but you\u2019ve got to quickly understand what\u2019s needed to be done, and then you\u2019ve got to mobilise every possible resource to do it. Some of the methods you use are controversial, but you\u2019ve got to take the widest possible view.\u201d\n\nHis mistake, he suggests, was succeeding in emerging from recession, but failing to convey the case for running a fiscal deficit to do so. \u201cYou\u2019ve always got to be thinking of what happens next. In Britain at the moment we\u2019ve got to get out of the immediate crisis, but then you\u2019ve got this issue of which companies are going to survive after you\u2019ve solved the medical problem.\u201d\n\nThis Gordon Brown is mellower than the rather defensive one I encountered in office, perhaps as a result of no longer being constantly attacked. If it hurts to see the Tories lauded for turning Keynesian overnight, it doesn\u2019t show.\n\n\u201cThe irony is that 10 years ago, the conventional wisdom was that running a deficit, as Keynes had argued in the 1930s, wasn\u2019t fashionable,\u201d he says philosophically. \u201cI think we were right then and I think people accept that we did the right thing, but we got penalised for it. Now there\u2019s a better understanding that if economic activity in your economy collapses then the only organisation that can come in is the government. To be honest, it\u2019s sad that what happened in 2010 led to austerity and everything else, because that was the inevitable consequence of not understanding that you had to run a fiscal deficit to deal with the problem.\u201d\n\nBrown won\u2019t say how the current bailouts should ultimately be paid for, but thinks one legacy of the virus may be greater aversion to risk. \u201cThere\u2019s climate change, there\u2019s cybersecurity issues, nuclear proliferation issues. People in this generation are going to be more aware that the balance of risk and security has to be examined and that will raise questions about what people expect of government.\u201d\n\nIf anything, he thinks enforced separation under lockdown has encouraged such solidarity. \u201cBeing isolated, people realise the need to be connected, the importance they attach to friendship, the importance of acting as a community.\u201d\n\nAfter years of separatist political movements, from Scottish independence to Brexit, is this crisis illustrating the dangers of separation?\n\n\u201cIt becomes a moment where we have got to make a choice,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we can\u2019t cooperate on this, then it doesn\u2019t say much about the world and I do think people in the end will.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd so I leave him to his phone calls; cloistered from the world now, but forever looking out.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2020/apr/16/cardboard-crowd-wuhan-wedding-thursdays-best-photos", "published": "2020-04-16T11:36:11", "title": "Cardboard crowd and Wuhan wedding: Thursday's best photos", "text": "Teknaf, Bangladesh The belongings of Rohingya refugees lie on the shore while the boat, which they travelled, remains anchored nearby.

But the hummingbird moves faster than I can set my shutter speed. The first picture has her as a smudge across the lens. In the next shot I captured only a flower, perfectly in focus but sucked of nectar, and the bird had flown. I learned to listen for the blur of wings; I learned to slow my breathing; I learned to be still.\n\nElizabeth Gowing\n\nSit and stare, Namibia\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Okaukuejo, Etosha national park\n\nWe\u2019d visited Etosha national park before, but had rushed from one waterhole to the next. This time, we decided to spend a whole day at Okaukuejo waterhole. While tourists loaded in to safari vehicles, we sat and watched. Herds of springbok and zebra gave way to jackals hunting and playing. They were joined by a rhino and giraffes. Shortly before midday, over 20 elephants suddenly appeared, and rushed into the water like excited teenagers. The safari vehicles hadn\u2019t returned from their searches, so it was just us (well, and one other couple) and the elephants. Magical.\n\nFrances Valdes\n\nLost in translation, Osaka\n\nOn a budget trip to Japan with my sisters and brother-in-law, one night in Osaka we stumbled into this tiny bar. The place was charming but, without any menus, we were afraid of falling into the classic tourist trap of spending a fortune. Several times, the kind, aged bartender explained we were in a nomihodai. The problem was, we didn\u2019t know what that meant. We cautiously ordered one drink each and \u2013 on his insistence \u2013 a glass of sake. He was so hospitable and tried to serve us food and more drinks but, still uneasy, we politely declined. It was only afterwards we learned that a nomihodai is an all-you-can-eat/drink bar. We could have stayed there for hours!\n\nSarah Collings\n\nHaving a laugh, Gambia\n\nI took this in Gambia after our taxi broke down in the middle of nowhere. We had to walk a mile to the nearest village to find a mechanic. The local children found our breakdown quite amusing. This had been a special day, travelling cross-country to see chimpanzees and hippos in the wild. So although we missed our ferry back, the day will stay with me for a long time.\n\nRichard Gabriel\n\nJump for joy, Valencia\n\nOn the beach at Peniscola\n\nThis is my daughter Lucia (aged 14) in the sea at Peniscola, near Valencia, in 2010. The photo sums up that holiday \u2013 hot, watery and very Spanish. Every day we would gather at our apartment poolside bar, where all the holidaying locals in their swimwear would drink cold wine, eat seafood tapas and smoke. There were very few British tourists but a number of French and Germans. In the town there was a wonderful cafeteria called Los Jubilados run by retired ladies who served vast plates of arroz negro and chipirones at ridiculously low prices. It\u2019s a beautiful place to visit, particularly in the summer heat.\n\nSimon Williams\n\nDive into West Sweden\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tj\u00f6rn diving tower\n\nTo celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary in August 2016, we invited a crowd of family and friends to join us in West Sweden \u2013 many of whom had been with us when we married on the beach on the island of Orust. We live in the UK but visit my husband\u2019s native land as often as we can. The day we visited the island of Tj\u00f6rn to jump from the diving tower at Stockevik was perfect, sunny and warm.

My family really put this assessment to the test when within 10 hours of arriving my dad\u2019s long-term medical condition had flared up. This precipitated a mad rush to get him on the last night ferry to Islay, through the tail end of Hurricane Dorian. From Islay hospital he was airlifted to Glasgow (and apparently fed chips en route by the paramedics). He returned in good health to the tranquillity of Jura, where members of the population of 188 showed the full extent of their hospitality and generosity. He thereafter received innumerable free ferry trips and enquiries after his health (it seems gossip spread remarkably fast!).\n\nCora\n\nTotally tropical London\n\nWalking along the Southbank, I came across this shot.

How is that going?\n\nAmersbach: \u201cWe received over 40 additional physicians and nurses aboard the ICU. We came into New York to treat non- COVID patients and we are transitioning from that. We have been able to discharge 60 patients, including patients who have recovered from COVID-19.\u201d\n\nWarrior: How has the transition and COVID-19 treatment been progressing?\n\nAmersbach: \u201cWe have over 30 patients in the ICU, some suffering from acute respiratory distress and multi-system organ failure. Our ICU is capable of treating 80 patients overall. We are doing our best to maximize their care. We have 19 patients on ventilators.

Families across the country are suffering from debt and from uncertainty. Many of them will likely come apart under the strain.\n\n\n\nSo in the name of protecting the public from a deadly virus, we have wound up destroying a huge number of people.\n\nJAMES CARAFANO: CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE \u2014 US MILITARY'S CRUCIAL ROLE IN BENDING THE CURVE\n\n\n\nRegardless of your political position, you could acknowledge it's one of the saddest things to happen to this country in a very long time. And yet some of our political class don't seem sad at all.\n\n\n\nFor them, this is not a human tragedy, it is an opportunity.\n\nNow, as a rule, it is the most mediocre people who are trying the hardest to exploit this moment. Here's case one.\n\n\n\nIn the long history of the Commonwealth of Virginia, it's likely that no politician has ever amassed a record more embarrassing or less impressive than the current governor of that state, Klan robes blackface.\n\n\n\nAs the Easter weekend approached, Governor Klan robes announced he'd be signing a tall stack of highly radical partisan legislation, mostly because he could.\n\n\n\nGOV. RALPH NORTHAM, D-Va.: As we deal with the pandemic, my administration has also worked to deal with the 1,291 bills passed by the General Assembly.\n\n\n\nToday, we announce that I have signed landmark gun safety legislation, as well as the Women's Reproductive Health Protection Act. By tomorrow night, I will have acted on all the legislation before me.\n\n\n\nMore than 1,200 bills -- gun control, as sop to the abortion industry ripping down historic monuments. It was like an entire rundown from an MSNBC weekend show all signed into law.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing the interest groups that control Governor Klan robes didn't get in this. They got it all.\n\n\n\nBut there's at least one bill in that stack that ought to worry you, even if you're lucky enough not to live in Virginia, his so-called election reforms.\n\n\n\nWith his signature, Klan robes eliminated all of Virginia's voter ID laws. He signed legislation that allows residents to vote up to 45 days before an election for any reason. There's also automatic voter registration for anyone using the state's DMV, including those who do it online.\n\n\n\nNow, those are big changes, unprecedented changes, but Governor Klan robes is not the only one who is pushing them. So-called election reform is a coordinated effort and that should not surprise you. The party that won't let you think for yourself, always acts as one.\n\n\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama is using this crisis to promote the radical expansion of nationwide voting by mail. Citizens could request ballots online and then print them at home.\n\n\n\nNow, no serious person at the national level has ever suggested doing that before because, of course, it would instantly destroy the public's faith in election outcomes and hence, our democracy.\n\n\n\nBut if there was ever a time to sneak something this disruptive past a beleaguered and distracted population, this is it. The justification for all this -- take a guess -- yes, racism.\n\n\n\nSEN.

What century is this?\n\nWell, if you guessed everything you just heard is a complete and utter provable lie, well, then you win Tuesday night's insight award.\n\n\n\nGovernment IDs are not racist, they are mandatory. You can't live here without one. If you don't have an ID, you can't drive, you can't fly. You can't open a bank account, can't apply for a mortgage, get welfare. Buy alcohol or tobacco. You can't hold a legal job.\n\n\n\nPretty much every person in America has a government ID. And in fact, in February 2019, a paper co-authored by professors at Harvard and the University of Bologna in Italy found that voter ID laws had no effect whatsoever on voter turnout for any subgroup they measured, whether it was by age or gender or party or yes, by race.\n\n\n\nThis is a complete and utter crock -- and everyone who says it knows that. So why are they continuing to say it? Well, you know why? Because voter ID laws stop voter fraud.\n\n\n\nDemocrats encourage voter fraud because it helps them win elections -- and that's not a guess.\n\n\n\nIn California, the Democratic-controlled legislature allows something called ballot harvesting. That's when political activists are allowed to pick up ballots and then turn them into the state by the hundreds and thousands.\n\nWhy do they get to do this? Well, of course, you can guess what happens next.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\n\nIn Orange County, California during the last election cycle. Sixty-two percent of all ballots were absentee. A huge percentage of those ballots were late arrivals, meaning, they got to the state after Election Day.\n\n\n\nA quarter-million of them were supposedly cast by inactive voters. That means people who hadn't voted in the past four years. Some significant number of those were fraudulent.\n\n\n\nThe Institute for Fair Elections found at least 20 voters whose registered address was a local dog park, 71 were registered to a Starbucks.\n\n\n\nUnder California law, and this is by design, there is virtually no way to distinguish a fraudulent vote from a real one.\n\nThe result?

Then in North Carolina, a hundred people tried to gather in Raleigh against the state's ongoing shutdown, police arrived, dispersed the protest, arrested one woman, and just in case you're mistaking why they did that, they issued a statement that was very clear here it is, \"Protesting is a nonessential activity.\" Now, that's not a quote from Orwell. That's an actual quote from the authorities in Raleigh, North Carolina, and they're wrong.\n\n\n\nThis is America. We're allowed to disagree with what our leaders do, however, we like and we're allowed to express that disagreement in public. That's our birthright.

The COVID-19 pandemic may very well be the stopping point for higher education to consider whether standardized tests should be the ultimate tool of measure for college admission.\n\nFor years, standardized tests have been the pinnacle for university admissions to determine a student\u2019s academic success.

As of this week, a total of 51 universities have suspended the requirements of standardized testing while many other schools are making these tests optional. The New York Times reported, some such as Boston University, Tufts and Northeastern have adopted an \"optional testing policy.\"\n\nAs more institutions work to adapt to these unique circumstances, schools are finally beginning to consider, should standardized testing be the end all and be all of determining a student\u2019s academic worth? Surely, it may be a significant determining factor for where a student currently stands. But over the years our nation has embraced these tests as the measure students are often held to when applying to their school of choice.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFollowing the college admission scandal of last year, falsified SAT and ACT scores pressed universities to consider if too much emphasis was being placed on these standardized scores. Since last year, schools across the nation have been dropping the requirement of standardized tests. In fact, throughout last summer more than one school each week was announcing the removal of SAT/ACT requirements. A study published in the \u201cEducational Researcher\u201d journal, shows that a high school GPA can predict college graduation rates five times more accurately than ACT scores.\n\nEarlier this year, a study by Steve Syverson called \"Defining Access: How Test-Optional Works\" found that ending SAT/ACT requirements encouraged more applications and diversity for universities, without weakening schools\u2019 graduation rates.\n\nIn addition to being an unfair assessment of a student\u2019s academic capabilities, many universities have also found that these requirements can hinder universities from a more diverse enrollment. Last fall, The Washington Post published that many of the schools that had dropped the SAT/ACT admissions requirement to draw a more diverse group \u201creported that those efforts were successful.\u201d\n\nNow, more universities are beginning to see that standardized tests are not an entirely accurate reflection of a student\u2019s academic success, let alone their full potential. At Southeastern University, while we do assess a student\u2019s SAT/ACT scores, we holistically weigh out each student\u2019s application. We consider their academic successes and achievements, their extracurricular involvements and whether or not they are at a place to take on the demands of higher education. Perhaps our standard for admittance should reconsider if there is only one measure for learning?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIndeed, there is no cookie-cutter approach to learning and therefore no one way to determine a student\u2019s academic potential. Yet, over the years, America\u2019s system of higher education has bought into the idea that ACT and SAT scores are a strong indication of a student\u2019s future academic success.\n\nIf anything, before we continue pushing forward with ideal standards that may be broken, this pandemic has caused us to take a moment to really weigh out how we determine the worth of a student\u2019s academic potential.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DR.

Sign up here.\n\nAcross the nation, Americans have responded to the COVID-19 crisis with ingenuity, can-do spirit and fortitude. In the worst public health crisis our nation has ever faced, we have seen everyday Americans mobilize quickly to save lives.\n\nMuch of the recognition has rightfully focused on the nurses, doctors and facility employees serving on the front lines at our country\u2019s hospitals. They have been working day and night in extremely difficult situations.\n\nYet, another group of health care workers deserves our praise, acknowledgment and help: those working in our nation\u2019s nursing homes.\n\nDR. ROBERT SIEGEL: CORONAVIRUS REOPENING \u2014 IF HEALTH RESTRICTIONS ROLLED BACK TOO SOON THIS COULD HAPPEN\n\nThese people are protecting 1.4 million of our parents and grandparents. These frail nursing home residents, nearly half of whom lived through the Great Depression and World War II, are the least able to withstand even common infections, not to mention a virus like the one we are fighting now. In fact, the COVID-19 case fatality rate is approaching 20 percent in nursing homes.\n\nAt our centers, we have been stringent and aggressive with infection prevention measures, and this has helped keep the volume of cases much lower than they otherwise might have been. Our precautions range from the no visitation rules and residents remaining in their rooms, to no outside medical appointments except for life-saving treatments, to staff always wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nWe have seen the pictures of family members outside of quarantined nursing homes, holding up signs, singing happy birthday, and celebrating wedding anniversaries. This is heartbreaking, but the restrictions are necessary. To support those residents and families, we have equipped centers with iPads to enable resident-family video conference calls.\n\nWe remain vigilant, but we are greatly concerned because the situation is likely to get much worse without additional support from Washington, D.C., on three important fronts.\n\nFirst, the nurses, doctors, aides, therapists, PAs, NPs and others coming to work each day in America\u2019s nursing homes and throughout the health care system are the heroes, putting themselves at risk to care for those who are in these facilities. They need to be protected so they remain healthy and effective and \u2013 importantly \u2013 to reduce the possibility of spreading the virus to residents.\n\nYet, even as more PPE is arriving into the health care system now, nursing homes still are still facing significant shortages, especially of facemasks and gowns.\n\nIt is our hope that President Trump continues to put pressure on businesses to ensure more production of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gowns, face shields, gloves and ventilators. The president has in his arsenal the ability to compel businesses to meet the needs of the American people in this time of turmoil. He would save seniors who continue to die and have the support of millions of health care workers around the country for fully embracing the Defense Production Act: not just redirecting essential supplies, but actually creating more PPE in support of an increasingly beleaguered health care system.\n\nThose in nursing homes and long-term care facilities need the president\u2019s leadership now more than ever.\n\nSecond, we need faster, broader testing for residents and employees in nursing homes. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, agrees, stating in an April 9 press briefing, \u201cWe need to really ensure that nursing homes have sentinel surveillance. And what do I mean by that? That we\u2019re actively testing in nursing homes, both the residents and the workers, at all times.\u201d\n\nThis is welcome news from the president and his administration, and we look forward to nursing homes being elevated to Priority Level 1 alongside hospitals and other acute settings. A few states have already taken steps in this direction, such as Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. This can be replicated nationally.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFinally, we recognize space in hospitals is limited, but public health officials must be very careful about setting rules that direct nursing facilities to admit contagious patients with COVID-19. State health departments must work together with the hospitals and the nursing facilities to identify safe locations for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus, without unnecessarily exposing the most vulnerable. The president can ask state leaders to come up with solutions to avoid making potential tragic policy decisions that put healthy seniors in harm\u2019s way.\n\nOur seniors deserve the best care possible. We must come together as a nation and put politics aside to protect the nurses and doctors serving them through this crisis. Those in nursing homes and long-term care facilities need the president\u2019s leadership now more than ever.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "author": ["Richard Feifer", "Md", "Mph", "Is The President Of Genesis Physician Services", "Chief Medical Officer At Genesis Healthcare", "Which Is The Nation'S Largest Skilled Nursing", "Long-Term Care Provider", "Caring For Patients Across Nearly Facilities In States."]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/CZoyFRJGqVk/coronavirus-treatment-plasma-therapy-beat-virus-newt-gingrich", "published": "2020-04-16T14:20:31", "title": "Newt Gingrich: Treating coronavirus \u2013 how an old therapy can help beat a new virus", "text": "Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nA major key to beating the new coronavirus will be the development of a range of therapies that will let us lead normal lives as we defeat the disease.\n\nFinding and developing therapies can occur much faster than finding a vaccine. Indeed, with HIV/AIDS we have yet to find a vaccine. In fact, a recent estimate is that 2030 might be the earliest we can expect a vaccine for that virus. However, the number of successful therapies has reduced the danger of HIV/AIDS dramatically.\n\nWith COVID-19, we have the advantage that over the years we have developed a number of therapies to help people recover from contagious diseases. One such therapy is the use of convalescent plasma. This uses the blood of someone who has survived the virus and recovered to help bolster the immune systems of the infected.\n\nDAVID BOSSIE: CORONAVIRUS AND TRUMP \u2013 BIASED MEDIA'S ATTACKS NO MATCH FOR THIS PRESIDENT\n\nConvalescent serum (plasma) has been used in many pandemics in the past, including the 1918 Spanish Flu, the 1934 Convalescent Measles and the 1946 Mumps. The practice ended after the 1950s because of the discovery of blood-borne pathogens and because many new vaccines were developed that started to prevent these diseases.\n\nMore recently, convalescent plasma has been used in other coronavirus diseases, including SARS Coronavirus in 2003. There was an 80-patient study in Hong Kong which found that treatment with convalescent plasma had a higher discharge rate of patients than those who were not treated (58.3 percent vs. 15.6 percent).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn addition, in the current COVID-19 pandemic, both China and Italy have used convalescent plasma as a treatment and the emerging data is encouraging. However, it\u2019s important to note this data is not based on controlled clinical trials.\n\nHuman convalescent serum is an option for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease that could be rapidly available when there are sufficient numbers of people who have recovered and can donate immunoglobulin-containing serum -- or blood with developed antibodies to fight the virus.\n\nWhile we are just starting to develop the ability to treat COVID-19 with convalescent plasma it has already saved lives.\n\nWhen Stacie Rathel\u2019s husband, 52-year-old Michael Kevin Rathel, was admitted to the intensive care unit at Orlando Health Regional Medical Center infected with COVID-19, Stacie and her three children felt helpless. Because the virus is so infectious, they couldn\u2019t visit him. As his health condition worsened, Stacie reached out to a few close friends, who in turn shared their story on social media.\n\nNaturally, Stacie also kept in close contact with her husband\u2019s doctors about his condition. As his health continued to decline to the point of being put on a ventilator, the doctors in Orlando suggested they try a convalescent plasma. This emerging therapeutic treatment for patients of COVID-19 was just OK\u2019d by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this month.\n\nIf you know someone who has recovered from COVID-19, encourage them to look into donating blood to help save the lives of others.\n\nThere are a few known risks related to convalescent plasma treatment. Patients could potentially have a reaction to the transfusion or could be exposed to other infectious diseases. However, in early risk-benefit analysis convalescent plasma suggests benefits for all age groups.\n\nHoping to save Michael, the family agreed, and Stacie\u2019s race to save her husband\u2019s life began. But she had to find a blood donor that met strict criteria. The donor needed:\n\na prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented from a lab test;\n\ncomplete resolution of symptoms at least 14 days prior to donation;\n\nto test negative for COVID-19;\n\na blood type compatible with her husband\u2019s;\n\nand the blood had to be donated through an FDA-approved, registered and licensed facility.\n\nAnd, of course, there are forms that need to be filled out. Lots and lots of forms.\n\nStacie turned to social media to find her \u201cneedle in a haystack.\u201d Thankfully, she found a donor match for her husband in COVID-19 survivor James Crocker. Her husband received the plasma treatment on April 8.\n\nMichael came out of his medically induced coma on Easter morning. His wife shared a FaceTime video with the local news. He's still on a ventilator, but he is breathing on his own 60 percent of the time. (Convalescent plasma usually takes three to five days to work.)\n\nAccording to Michael\u2019s doctor, George Ralls, \"He\u2019s had steady improvement. It's very promising. We\u2019re very optimistic. We\u2019re doing everything we can to lead him to a full recovery \u2026 It\u2019s really encouraging to see the amount of patients willing to try anything.\"\n\nThe major issue we face right now is the donated plasma from recovered COVID-19 survivors is scarce. We simply don\u2019t have enough donors on a wide-scale level. Although as we see people recover from COVID-19, the donor pool will grow larger with time. Then it\u2019s a matter of collection, processing and distribution.\n\nIf you know someone who has recovered from COVID-19, encourage them to look into donating blood to help save the lives of others. The FDA regulates who can donate convalescent plasma and how it must be collected.

Schools will likely need to modify their practices so that teachers, staff and students maintain social distancing standards when they return.\n\nFederal agencies could get ahead of another potential learning crisis in America\u2019s schools by developing guidance so that school districts can carry out social distancing.\n\nCAL THOMAS: CORONAVIRUS SIDE EFFECT: MORE FAMILIES BEING INTRODUCED TO HOMESCHOOLING\n\nSchool districts and state education agencies may not be best positioned to develop social distancing plans from scratch, since they are overtaxed with remote learning during the current crisis. And it could be unnecessarily duplicative for each state or district to create such plans on their own.\n\nSocial distancing practices in schools will be more complex than just placing desks six feet apart. Currently, there is neither good guidance nor much evidence about the effectiveness of particular school practices.\n\nBut just as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has put out interim guidance about safety practices for essential workers, a federal agency could issue guidance for schools based on expert opinion and available knowledge about the feasibility of various social distancing practices carried out in the past.\n\nI was one of the authors of a review for the CDC in 2016 of states\u2019 school health emergency plans. We located a total of 38 plans, since not every state had a publicly posted plan. We found that only 16 states had one or more practices for social distancing. None of these 16 state plans had substantive detail about how to implement their practices.\n\nTo elicit more social distancing options and experts\u2019 views about the practicality of those various social distancing measures, the RAND Corporation convened 36 focus groups consisting of district superintendents, school principals, teachers, school nurses and state health pandemic planners in 2017.\n\nTheir answers revolved around five themes. Federal guidance could help on each.\n\nFor example, one theme is that schools need clear ways to communicate to staff and to parents what the social distancing practices are, why they are important and who is involved.\n\nAnother theme is that schools want guidance about recommended combinations of social distancing measures to put in practice, rather than simply a list of options, such as canceling field trips or other events where large numbers of students congregate.\n\nDepending on the state of disease transmission, schools may well need to enact some combination of hygiene practices like masks, handwashing and disinfecting surfaces; new within-school practices like staggering activities such as meals, recess and hallway transitions; and potentially reduced schedules like half-days or shortened school weeks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThese changes carry big implications for schools\u2019 required instructional hours per year, staffing, parents\u2019 work schedules and transportation practices.\n\nFor example, keeping students in one class throughout the full day could have a profound effect on how schools deliver instruction \u2013 especially for middle and high schools, where students typically change classes during the day.\n\nStaggering arrival and drop-off times could reduce the congregation of students on buses and in common spaces at schools. However, it would increase the number of buses required and complicate parents\u2019 work schedules, especially for families with multiple school-age children.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe good news is that schools\u2019 current trial-by-fire transition to online learning means that future combinations of face-to-face learning and remote learning are more feasible and less daunting.\n\nStill, learning loss could be even worse if schools face another crisis this fall. To avoid another scramble, a federal agency could undertake the task of creating social distancing guidance (for example, by a taskforce). This would make it possible in the fall for educators to turn from emergency planning management to instead focus on what they do best: teaching students.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HEATHER SCHWARTZ", "author": ["Heather Schwartz", "Heather Schwartz Is The Director Of The Pre-K To Educational Systems Program", "A Senior Policy Researcher At The Nonprofit", "Nonpartisan Rand Corporation."]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/47Cx_JVR4X8/colin-reed-coronavirus-gives-trump-a-bully-pulpit-will-it-help-or-hurt-his-reelection-hopes", "published": "2020-04-16T13:00:59", "title": "Colin Reed: Coronavirus gives Trump a bully pulpit \u2013 will it help or hurt his reelection hopes?", "text": "Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.

It\u2019s still an open question if the younger, liberal and restless members of the party get on board with a 77-year-old politician who has been in Washington since Watergate.\n\nNow the attention shifts toward the next major inflection point for Biden: the veepstakes.

Lots of reputations are on the line.\n\nThe weather is warming as we reach mid-spring, and summer approaches. Still another debate may soon be settled. Will rising temperatures slow the epidemic, as some confidently predicted based on other viral outbreaks?

Candidate Trump \u2014 the ultimate political outsider \u2014 defeated a powerful entrenched career politician to capture the White House when no one said it was possible. The president then stormed into Washington and exposed the Russia hoax and a corrupt deep state that spied on his campaign.\n\nAnd while dealing with relentless attacks from the liberal media, his pro-growth economic policies and supreme confidence in the American worker ushered in one of the greatest economic booms in our nation\u2019s history. Then, being faced with the prospects of heading into an election year with record low unemployment and historic job creation and no positive agenda of their own, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her lapdog Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., concocted a political tall tale about a routine phone call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine. This shameful impeachment stunt blew up in their faces.\n\nIt\u2019s now been nearly five years since Trump came down the golden escalator. Since that day, the biased liberal media made the decision to destroy him. Sadly, that effort continues today with their coverage of Trump\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTIM GRAHAM: BIDEN SEX ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS VS. KAVANAUGH CHARGES \u2014 LIBERAL MEDIA'S HYPOCRISY ON DISPLAY\n\nNow there's always been bias in the media, but this president has exposed it in a way no one else could have. The liberal media\u2019s hatred for Trump has made it plainly obvious that many so-called journalists who cover him are political activists. This is why the president battles the news media on a daily basis.\n\nThe anti-Trump media has turned into the opposition. They attack whatever decision the president makes. This isn\u2019t journalism, and the president is right to criticize what\u2019s become of the once-respected fourth estate.\n\nTake, for example, the president\u2019s recent comments about his plans to reopen the greatest economy on Earth after the worst of the coronavirus crisis is behind us. The president clearly stated this enormous decision will be made in consultation with state governors. He was immediately attacked by the liberal media for acting like a monarch opposed to states' rights.\n\nThis is Trump Derangement Syndrome at its worst. The president has big-government liberals and left-wing reporters in knots. The same people who usually want power centralized in Washington, now are supporting states' rights. The larger point is that with every decision Trump makes to combat COVID-19, the media formulates some rationale to oppose the decision, no matter what.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhen the president makes his announcement, the biased media will go straight to the same old playbook. Reporters will probably omit that his decision was made in consultation with the experts, the science and the data. They\u2019ll almost certainly ignore the fact that the president wrestled mightily with figuring out the right way to get Americans back to work while guarding against the second wave of coronavirus.\n\nAnd they definitely won\u2019t give him any credit, regardless of whether he decides on a state-by-state, regional or a national reopening approach. The political hacks covering the decision will attack it either way.\n\nWe're in the midst of a global pandemic not seen in 100 years, and the liberal media still won't be fair to Trump.\n\nThankfully, the president has other outlets. He can speak directly to the American people with his press conferences, on social media and through conservative media outlets. The liberal media\u2019s reluctance to cover the president\u2019s daily COVID-19 press conferences is telling. It confirms the press conferences are an extremely effective method of communication for Trump and his adversaries in the media are bitter about it.\n\nBut through it all, the American people see through the bias. Whether you voted for him in 2016 or not, you know by now that Trump will outwork the opposition forces in Washington and make the best decision he can for the country and people that he loves so dearly \u2013 regardless of party affiliation. This is called leadership.\n\nNo one would have guessed that California Gov. Gavin Newsom and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u2014 let alone New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2014 would praise anything Trump did, but it\u2019s happening. The president works for all Americans, not just some.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe liberal media dug itself a deep hole during the Trump presidency. The coverage of coronavirus could have been the moment to stop digging, but the media's collective stubbornness knows no bounds. Members of the media simply refuse to pull out of their death spiral. We're in the midst of a global pandemic not seen in 100 years, and the liberal media still won't be fair to Trump.\n\nThe liberal media has a partisan agenda, and Trump is making sure everyone knows it. They despise Trump because he\u2019s winning, and they\u2019re scared to death at the thought of unsteady Sleepy Joe Biden on a debate stage with him come October. The liberal media has tried to destroy this president since 2015 and has failed miserably. With their negative coverage of his response to the COVID-19 crisis, they\u2019ll come up short again. President Trump is rising to the occasion because he\u2019s the greatest game-time player ever.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID BOSSIE", "author": ["David Bossie", "David N.

Ask this question three months ago, and a lot of people \u2014 their imaginations fueled by \u201cpanic in the streets\u201d movies and long-outdated stereotypes \u2014 would have predicted gas-masked troops lined up shoulder-to-shoulder, advancing with bayonet-tipped rifles to disperse crowds of desperate civilians.\n\nWell, THAT didn\u2019t happen! Indeed, when historians write about the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak, they will note that the armed forces played a crucial role in turning the tide against the disease.\n\nThe military has jumped into the fight wholeheartedly. And I\u2019m not just talking active duty and reserves. Even our veterans have joined in the fray.\n\nREP. BRIAN MAST: CORONAVIRUS \u2014 SPEAKER PELOSI, AMERICANS RISKING IT ALL ON THE JOB, CONGRESS SHOULD WORK TOO\n\nLate last month, the Army sent out a call to retired soldiers, particularly those in the medical field, asking them to voluntarily put their uniforms back on, leave their families and their livelihoods, and join in the fight against the \"invisible enemy.\" About 800,000 have answered that call, with more than 25,000 already back in harness. Some are now helping and healing in the heart of the hot zones.\n\nThat\u2019s selfless service. Yet the kneejerk expectation that \u201cmilitary in action\u201d means soldiers enforcing quarantines at gunpoint remains common. Why so?\n\nMuch of this mythology stems from actual events in the 1960s, when soldiers garbed in gas masks really did challenge civil rights and anti-war protesters at the point of a gun. Moviemakers soon appropriated this motif for horror movies. It was a staple of scary filmdom for a quarter of a century, from George Romero\u2019s \u201cThe Crazies\u201d (1973) to Dean R. Koontz\u2019s \u201cPhantoms\u201d (1998).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nYears ago, the University of Delaware Disaster Research Center found that most popular impressions of how people respond in disaster come from watching disaster movies. No surprise, then, that the image of armed soldiers marching against their own citizenry still lives in the popular imagination.\n\nIn real life, thankfully, the military's primary purpose in every disaster is to aid, serve and protect. When Lt. Gen. Russ Honor\u00e9 stepped in to manage the post-Katrina hurricane response, one of his first actions was to order the troops involved in relief efforts to carry no weapons. This made clear that the soldiers weren\u2019t there to intimidate or occupy. They were simply there to help.\n\nThus far, the military response to the coronavirus outbreak has consisted largely of deploying elements of the Army National Guard \u2014 individuals with civilian occupations who don their uniforms only when training or called up to active duty. In most cases, the federal government pays the troop salaries and operating costs, but the troops operate under the command of the state adjutant generals, who serve under their governors.\n\nThus, the state or territory determines the missions assigned to the forces, be it setting up COVID-19 testing stations, delivering meals to nursing homes or maybe even sometimes enforcing laws as directed by state or local civil authorities.\n\nAmerica\u2019s men and women in uniform have worked with their civilian brothers and sisters to take care of our communities.\n\nBut the National Guard isn\u2019t the whole story of America's military response to the virus. Virtually every branch is conducting various support missions, from the \"air-bridge\" flying personal protective equipment and other medical supplies into the U.S., to the temporary hospitals built by Army Corps of Engineers, to the Navy hospital ships now anchored in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nIndeed, at the most critical moments of the response, the U.S. uniformed services \u2014 which include the Public Health Services \u2014 have been there. They have delivered medical equipment and supplies, medical personnel, support manpower and logistical aid to the hottest hot spots \u2014 often help by providing the extra capacity needed to keep the civilian response from being overwhelmed. Without them, we might have seen medical systems crash and the contagion taking a much more gruesome toll.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSome authoritarian regimes have used their militaries like sledgehammers to enforce quarantines and to isolate those they deem to pose a danger. But America\u2019s men and women in uniform have worked with their civilian brothers and sisters to take care of our communities.\n\nIn many ways, those who say we weren't prepared for this pandemic speak out of ignorance. For decades the U.S. has honed its disaster response system \u2014 and always with a large role carved out for the military.

It continues to be China\u2019s cat\u2019s paw, peddling Beijing\u2019s propaganda and helping obfuscate its culpability. But even agreeing, as I do, that our government should cut off the WHO, does the president have the power to do it?\n\nThe question presses because the United States is the top financial backer of the WHO. No other country is close. The WHO\u2019s budget is about $6 billion per annum, and the American contribution is over $400 million \u2014 about ten times China\u2019s contribution, as the president has pointed out.\n\nREBECCA GRANT: CORONAVIRUS FAILURE BY WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION JUSTIFIES TRUMP\u2019S AID CUTOFF\n\nDemocrats are gearing up to fight Trump on the plan to halt WHO funding, and they will get help from the usual array of moneyed progressives (Bill Gates is already raising alarms) and the self-regarding \u201cinternational community\u201d . . . not least the WHO itself.

We\u2019ll have to see what the budgeting fine print says, but as we noted when the president reprogrammed some Defense Department funding for the purpose of border wall construction, presidents often have wiggle room to move appropriated money around. This is especially so when there is a national emergency.\n\nRecall that there are many emergency provisions in federal law, some going back decades, through which Congress has given the president spending discretion. Recall in addition that President Trump has already invoked Stafford Act emergency provisions in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nI\u2019d wager that the surest way to cut off the WHO and make it stick is to shift the appropriated WHO funding to COVID-19 relief for the states.

You can always demonstrate the media's political calculations by noticing they're not based on the evidence as much as they're based on who is accused.\n\nIn the spring of 1991, The New York Times reported that former first lady Nancy Reagan had an affair with Frank Sinatra, spreading unsubstantiated gossip from sleazy author Kitty Kelley.

Iseman sued, and the Times settled, claiming they never meant to imply there was a romance.\n\nIn the Trump era, the timing can be painfully obvious.

Perhaps that's due to the consistent media focus on the risks of reopening.\n\nPerhaps that's also due to the psychological comfort of the status quo: When we've been made to feel safe in our home, it's difficult to leave it. Or perhaps we, as a society, have so fundamentally altered our own perception of risk aversion that we aren't willing to leave our houses unless the risk is close to zero.\n\nWhatever the reason, it is simply untenable to lock Americans down for months more. Calls to do so ignore not only the catastrophic human suffering inflicted on millions -- employees who no longer have jobs, children who can no longer attend school, entrepreneurs who have seen their life's dreams and savings destroyed at the behest of the government -- but the reality of economics, which is that government cannot interminably pay everyone to stay at home.\n\nGORDON G. CHANG: TRUMP RIGHT TO STOP FUNDING WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OVER ITS BOTCHED CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE\n\nFurthermore, long-term lockdowns do not even prevent the virus from eventual second-wave spreading; when we emerge from our homes, we will pass the virus to one another again.\n\nSo, how should we view the risks of reopening our society?\n\nRationally.\n\nThis means that we should stop looking at false case fatality rates as inevitabilities. We simply don't know how many Americans have had coronavirus, or how many have it now. We do know that the number of confirmed cases is far lower than the number of cases in society more broadly.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn New York, the supposed case fatality rate -- the number of deaths from coronavirus over the number of confirmed cases -- rests at around 5 percent. But between March 22 and April 4, 215 pregnant women were screened for COVID-19 in New York City, according to The New England Journal of Medicine. Four women had symptoms of COVID-19, and 29 tested positive despite being asymptomatic. This means 13.7 percent of these women had COVID-19 without knowing it -- for every symptomatic woman, there were seven others who were asymptomatic but positive.\n\nIf applied statewide -- a simplistic model but certainly one that would be closer to accuracy than mere confirmed cases -- this would drop the case fatality rate from 5 percent to 0.7 percent. Needless to say, such a statistic would alleviate some worry, particularly among less vulnerable populations.\n\nWe should also stop treating all cohorts of American society as equally vulnerable to coronavirus.\n\nAccording to two New York University studies, the first most predictive condition for hospitalization was age: Almost half of all coronavirus patients hospitalized in New York City were over the age of 65. The next most predictive condition was obesity. And over 70 percent of hospitalized coronavirus patients had a chronic condition.\n\nThis should be no surprise: As of April 12, the New York City Health Department reported 128 fatalities among people with no underlying conditions and just 26 deaths among people below age 45 with no underlying conditions. There were 42,524 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 for New Yorkers under age 45, meaning that the case fatality rate -- again, a seriously high-end estimate given the fact that asymptomatic people have not been tested -- for those with no underlying health conditions below age 45 is 0.06 percent. In other words, 9,397 out of every 10,000 young, healthy people who get coronavirus will not die -- and the number is likely higher than that.\n\nThis means that we should be looking to send young, healthy people back to work, and urging social distancing and isolation for those who are elderly or have preexisting conditions that raise coronavirus risks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe should retain social distancing for the young and healthy, urge mask-wearing and perform contact tracing when hot spots arise.

They may be profoundly mistaken.\n\nConsider these scenarios.\n\nRapid rollback disaster\n\nIf all public health measures were immediately lifted, the pandemic could reignite with full fury. At this point, there is no vaccine. There are no effective drugs. Testing is still woefully inadequate. And the vast majority of people are still completely susceptible to infection.\n\nDR. NAN HAYWORTH: FALLING CORONAVIRUS PROJECTIONS \u2014 TRUMP'S STRATEGY IS WORKING\n\nSlow-Motion Pandemic\n\nAlternatively, if public health measures were slowly lifted, it could lead to a slow-motion pandemic in which the health system would no longer be in peril of being overwhelmed.\n\nIf the only deaths that are prevented are the excess deaths from an overwhelmed health care system, the result would still be tragic.\n\nUnfortunately, in this second scenario, nearly everyone at risk who was at increased risk before would still be at risk: older individuals, those with underlying health conditions, those living in communal situations, minorities, the impoverished, the unhoused, and those attending large events.\n\nIndividuals at risk need to be protected both as a moral imperative and as a way of stopping the further spread of the virus and the ongoing impact that will have on everyone.\n\nBehavioral defense\n\nIn the absence of drugs, vaccines or pervasive testing, only behavioral measures stand between the relative calm of post-peak rates of infection and disaster.\n\nThe extent to which disease and death are averted will be a function of how well we maintain \u201cviral distancing,\u201d how much we have access to and use masks and gloves and sanitizer, how long we avoid mass gatherings, how well we isolate symptomatic individuals and those with exposure risks, and the extent to which there is testing and contact tracing.\n\nWe are all being tantalized by the promise that drugs, vaccines and return to the-way-things-were are all just around the corner. But we cannot be certain of any of those things.\n\nYes, the economy can be reopened; but only with pervasive public health measures in place. Access to gloves, masks and sanitizer should be considered a human right and these supplies should be freely available, as Singapore has done.\n\nProper equipment and scrupulous attention to public health measures would allow food production to be carried out safely and supply chains to be maintained. As the incidence of infection begins to fall, people in the service sector of the economy can re-engage.\n\nWith public health measures and vigilance, testing and contact tracing, recreation areas can be judiciously re-opened.\n\nLarge events pose large risks\n\nUntil there is a vaccine and/or effective treatments, however, large social gatherings of the pre-pandemic type are formulas for viral spread and potentially death. Events of this type include conferences, performances and concerts, and sports events.\n\nRemarkably, we still do not know the infection fatality rate. Ongoing serological surveys may soon help to clarify that number. It might be as low as one person in a thousand or it may be a lot higher. Unfortunately, with a less optimistic infection mortality rate, these numbers could be a lot higher.\n\nBut even the most hopeful predictions could still mean that people who attend large events or their contacts may contract this virus and die painfully and alone. For example, consider the risk of attending a New York Knicks home game with 19,000 potentially infectious fellow fans. Or a Dallas Cowboys home game with 90,000 others \u2014 cheering, yelling, coughing. Will every event come with a risk disclaimer like those on cigarette packs?\n\nIf everyone attending these events wore masks and gloves and scrupulously washed their hands, the death rates would be lower. They would be even lower if touching were limited. Or if we left one empty seat between each individual. Or if we all watched from home.\n\nSo the questions are:\n\nTo what extent are we willing to maintain these behavioral interventions? What is the number of deaths we are willing to tolerate?\n\nEven if it were available, testing would not help much for large attendance events because it is expensive, inconvenient and the results are delayed. Moreover, a single negative test does not guarantee that a person is safe.\n\nIn the case of the PCR test, the result may be negative simply because the sample was inadequate. The antibody test may be negative early in infection before the immune system has had time to react. Therefore individuals with negative antibody tests may be asymptomatic, but highly contagious.\n\nThe impact on schools\n\nChildren and young people will have a particularly hard time maintaining public health measures. So, unfortunately, schools may remain a potential source for spreading infection, which students can bring home to their families.\n\nUntil the incidence in a region is brought to zero, we will be in the midst of an \u201cactive infector\u201d in the classroom situation. And it is not a drill.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nCreative solutions are needed to help confront the ongoing burdens associated with continuing public health measures.\n\nEven now, many new jobs and new types of jobs are being created, not in spite of, but because of the pandemic. There is a need to scale up jobs in the manufacturing sector such as producing diagnostic tests, medical equipment and protective gear; and jobs in the service sector such as delivery services, health care provision and in monitoring public health vigilance.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nNew types of jobs are being created in the education sector, the communication sector, in data management and in the creation of tools for working remotely. There is also a need to vastly increase scientific and medical research.\n\nThis new economy can flourish in unimaginable ways.\n\nWe are all being tantalized by the promise that drugs, vaccines and return to the-way-things-were are all just around the corner.

Sign up here.\n\nPresident Trump should be applauded for his decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) while his administration reviews the group\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. taxpayers write a $400 million blank check to the WHO, an organization that is broken and long overdue for fundamental reform.\n\nIn fact, the WHO has proven in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic that it puts politics over public health. Rather than independently investigating or determining the nature and spread of the coronavirus, the WHO instead simply parroted the official pronouncements of the Chinese government and lavished praise on Beijing\u2019s response.\n\nIt\u2019s long past time for the United States to hold the WHO accountable for its mismanagement and lack of transparency.\n\nGORDON G. CHANG: TRUMP RIGHT TO STOP FUNDING WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OVER ITS BOTCHED CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE\n\nAs the Trump administration pauses funding to the WHO and examines how the organization has responded to the current crisis, it should demand answers to the following questions:\n\nFirst, why did the World Health Organization ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that the coronavirus could be transmitted between humans?\n\nThe likely answer to this question is tied to the WHO\u2019s consistent animosity toward Taiwan \u2013 borne out of its desire to placate the Chinese government. Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade province and has repeatedly sought to exclude it from participation in international organizations like the WHO. This view has been emphasized by the WHO\u2019s current leadership, particularly its director-general, Tedros Adahnom Ghebreyesus.\n\nTedros went so far recently as to spew unsupported accusations at Taiwan for mounting what he called \u201cracist\u201d attacks at him for his handling of the pandemic. Another senior leader of the WHO, Bruce Aylward, painfully avoided questions about Taiwan\u2019s handling of the coronavirus and instead complimented China for how it has dealt with it. All appearances suggest that the WHO simply ignored Taiwan to make peace with China, to the detriment of global public health.\n\nSecond, why did the WHO make several claims about the coronavirus that turned out to be either inaccurate or misleading in January and February, as the virus spread around the world?\n\nOn Jan. 14, the WHO reaffirmed China\u2019s now-debunked claim that the coronavirus could not be transmitted between human beings. This was after evidence had emerged that such transmission had likely already taken place in Wuhan. Two weeks later, Tedros traveled to Beijing and praised Xi Jinping\u2019s government for its \u201ctransparency\u201d in sharing information about the coronavirus. This was after the government had silenced or punished several doctors who spoke out about the virus and restricted Chinese institutions from publishing information about it.\n\nDuring the critical weeks and months when the virus began its spread in China and then around the world, the WHO seemed more interested in playing politics, rather than taking the actions that could have saved lives around the world.\n\nThen, on Jan. 31, the WHO argued against travel restrictions to China, arguing they \u201ccan cause more harm than good,\u201d even though public health officials in the U.S. have largely concluded that President Trump\u2019s travel ban helped to slow the spread of the virus here. And why, on Feb. 3, did Tedros say that the spread of the virus outside of China was \u201cminimal and slow,\u201d even though hundreds were infected around the world, including a handful in the United States?\n\nThird, why did the WHO wait as long as it did to take decisive action?\n\nIt did not declare a public health emergency until almost two months after the reported onset of first symptoms in a Wuhan patient (and a month after China first officially notified the WHO of the pathogen\u2019s existence). A WHO delegation did not visit China to examine conditions on the ground until mid-February, after the organization had simply repeated a number of claims made by Beijing about the nature of the virus and the extent of its spread. Finally, it took until March 11, when the virus had infected over 100,000 people in over 100 countries around the world, before the WHO came around to calling the disease outbreak a pandemic.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDuring the critical weeks and months when the virus began its spread in China and then around the world, the WHO seemed more interested in playing politics, rather than taking the actions that could have saved lives around the world.\n\nDefenders of the organization often argue that the WHO can only do what it is empowered to do; and that limits its ability to question the claims made by member states like China. If so, that\u2019s all the more reason for the U.S. to demand accountability for the hundreds of millions of dollars we send to the WHO. The organization should be reformed from within, so that it has the authority to conduct independent and rigorous examinations of claims made by its members \u2013 particularly when millions of lives are potentially at risk.\n\nWhile American funding to the WHO is paused, President Trump should convene a panel of public health experts both within and outside of government that can examine the questions asked here, as well as the WHO\u2019s practices more generally. The panel should make recommendations regarding organizational improvements, but might also look for ways for the U.S. to work with other international organizations, or countries around the world, to promote public health.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIndeed, if the WHO is broken beyond repair, it may ultimately be time for us to consider creating a new organization to do the important work of improving health outcomes and preventing disease around the world.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis has demonstrated the dangers of allowing an international organization like the WHO to fall under the influence of a single country that put its national interest above the greater good. We should not waste this opportunity to bring about the lasting, positive changes that will ultimately save lives and improve public health not just here, but around the world as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LANHEE CHEN", "author": ["Lanhee Chen", "Lanhee J.

Everything is coming together on the Democratic side of the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThat\u2019s good news, not just for Democrats, but for independents, and even for disaffected Republicans who are sick of the petulance and rancor that has replaced non-partisan expertise in our government.\n\nThis week, as a nation housebound under lockdown turns to jigsaw puzzles for amusement, another big piece of the 2020 Democratic presidential ticket has been put into place.\n\nSANDERS PREDICTS BIDEN CAMPAIGN'S 'SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT' TO THE LEFT, SAYS OPPOSING HIM 'IRRESPONSIBLE'\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has formally endorsed Joe Biden to be the Democratic party\u2019s nominee, putting his stamp of approval on a candidate already chosen by an overwhelming number of Democratic voters.\n\nIn a video released Tuesday, President Obama said that the man he chose to be his Vice President \u201chas the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery.\u201d\n\nWith our current leadership, so seemingly unable to experience the empathy that\u2019s needed in this challenging time, former President Obama noted that Joe Biden is \u201csomeone whose own life has taught him how to persevere; how to bounce back when you\u2019ve been knocked down.\u201d\n\nThis is a candidacy that can appeal not just to every stripe of Democratic voter, but to independents who value judgment and prudence, and even Republicans who long for a return to the stability and norms that make American government function properly, especially in challenging times.\n\nPresident Obama made certain to give proper recognition to Biden\u2019s last challenger for the nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders. Obama said \u201cBernie\u2019s an American original \u2014 a man who has devoted his life to giving voice to working people\u2019s hopes, dreams, and frustrations,\u201d and rightfully pointed out that \u201cthe ideas he\u2019s championed; the energy and enthusiasm he inspired, especially in young people, will be critical in moving America in a direction of progress and hope.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Bernie Sanders himself added a vital piece to the Democratic jigsaw puzzle just the day before, by issuing his own endorsement of Joe Biden. The two appeared together in a live-streamed video, with Sanders telling Biden \u201cWe need you in the White House,\u201d and Biden responding that \u201cI\u2019m going to need you. Not just to win the campaign, but to govern.\u201d Were both of them being careful to say exactly the right things at the right time? Yes. Is that an important skill in this unsettled time? Absolutely!\n\nBernie and Biden may have been the last two candidates standing, but they started out a year ago in a Democratic field that eventually numbered over two dozen. The quality of that batch of candidates was easily the match for any in the history of this nation. As Obama noted in his endorsement of Biden, \u201cEach of our candidates were talented and decent, with a track record of accomplishment, smart ideas, and serious visions for the future.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, they were by far the most diverse set of presidential aspirants ever, with candidates representing the African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and LGBQT communities. Half a dozen were women. And they represented every corner of this nation, from Hawaii to New England, with backgrounds in every level of government as well as impressive private sector experience. Any of them can be expected to contribute to a Biden presidency and to other Democratic administrations in the future.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThey were equally as diverse in the approaches they took to solving the problems vexing this nation, with voices careful and prudent as well as progressive and passionate. You can be sure that a Biden administration would have room for all of those voices to be heard and respected.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because, underneath the variety of policy approaches, every one of those candidates shares the core values of the Democratic Party. Those values include a fervent belief that quality, affordable healthcare is a right for all Americans, a devotion to protecting our planet and the environment, a commitment to a strong defense bolstered by close cooperation with our long-time allies, the vital importance of voting rights, and an economy that works for everyone.\n\nThose are the values that candidate Joe Biden is bringing to the race. And his candidacy will also reflect the diversity that was so important to the 2020 Democratic field\u2014Joe has already pledged that his VP choice will be a woman.\n\nThis is a candidacy that can appeal not just to every stripe of Democratic voter, but to independents who value judgment and prudence, and even Republicans who long for a return to the stability and norms that make American government function properly, especially in challenging times.\n\nDonald Trump will not be easy to defeat. There are institutional advantages to incumbency, even when the bragging rights that would have gone with an effectively-managed first term have been utterly squandered.\n\nBut underpinning the previously mentioned core Democratic values, are an even deeper set of values that all Americans hold in common\u2014a love for this country and for all of its people that transcends party differences, a commitment to treating everyone with dignity and respect, and an appreciation for the professionalism and expertise that are so vital in making America function.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThose are things that have been sadly neglected as of late, but which have always been vital elements of the American spirit in all of us. I think that people of all political persuasions are ready to return to a way of life that fosters those values.\n\nI believe that this country is more than ready to join with Joe Biden and the Democratic Party, as we simultaneously re-embrace the hallowed traditions of the past, and join those traditions with a fresh hope for a bright future of recovery, safety, prosperity, and growth.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DONNA BRAZILE", "author": ["Donna Brazile", "Veteran Political Strategist Donna Brazile Joined Fox News Channel As A Contributor In She'S The Founder", "Director Of Brazile", "Associates Llc", "A General Consulting", "Grassroots Advocacy", "Training Firm Based In Washington"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/SgmKeS3EXoc/phyllis-schlafly-was-not-only-a-leader-she-was-mom-heres-the-truth-about-her", "published": "2020-04-15T12:00:38", "title": "Anne Schlafly Cori: Phyllis Schlafly was not only a leader, she was mom.

Whether it was in her role as a wife, mother, author or as a leader in the socio-political movement, she forged a new path.\n\nSome consider her a contradiction because she advocated publically for the family and home during a time when some women in the public eye were campaigning for personal autonomy and self-centered professional advancement. But thousands of women were inspired by her fierce public advocacy for the homemaker, and she became the sweetheart of our nation\u2019s silent majority.\n\nPhyllis did what was thought by some to be revolutionary, or maybe better said \u2014 counter-revolutionary. She challenged the established political and social classes, and more importantly the elites.\n\nDR. NAN HAYWORTH: FALLING CORONAVIRUS PROJECTIONS \u2014 TRUMP'S STRATEGY IS WORKING\n\nPhyllis always did what she felt needed to be done. She did not wait for approval from anyone. She saw that no one was publically speaking for the majority of women \u2013 wives and mothers \u2013 so Phyllis Schlafly spoke for these women who she knew valued and prioritized being wives and mothers. To me, she was always \u201cmy mom\u201d but to so many others she was a powerful defender and an advocate of who they were or what they aspired to be.\n\nCurrently, there are those on the Left and in Hollywood who still feel threatened by what Phyllis stood for and what she accomplished in her life. So much so, that a new FX/Hulu show \u201cMrs. America\u201d is premiering on April 15. Hollywood wants to re-write history and distort the legacy and hard work Phyllis did to pave the way for American conservatives.\n\nTo this day, many women, and even men, who lead the conservative movement walk on the trails blazed first by Phyllis Schlafly. Progressives understand this and therefore want to diminish her influence, even years after her death.\n\nAny attack on the integrity of Phyllis Schlafly is, at its heart, an attack on the women who followed her. Women were attracted to her because she had the guts to stand up for her beliefs and the beliefs exuded by women who didn\u2019t feel pressured to be something they didn\u2019t want to be. Plus, she was always gracious and smiling. She modeled civility in dissent. She never called anyone a bad name and she never lost her composure. She used facts, not emotion, to win arguments. She carried herself in the exact opposite of what Hollywood is now trying to depict her as. They will, of course, highlight her strengths and portray them as weaknesses. But what they will do will backfire. She was always and forever grace under fire.\n\nShe stood in the line of social fire because she believed in her causes and believed that God gave her a purpose and a mission for her life. She wanted her life to matter and she wanted to make a difference. Also \u2013 and this is important for understanding her \u2013 Phyllis loved the fights and the battles. She loved every moment of the spotlight. Yes, she had an enormous ego and very little humility, but she also earned her own attention. She was never a victim and she believed that feminism taught women to be victims.\n\nI learned from my mother that, no matter the odds, I could achieve. She taught me to stand up straight and to stand up for myself. She taught me never to be intimidated by anyone.\n\nMore importantly, my mom was proud of the \u201cR\u201d in Mrs. She absolutely enjoyed being a wife. She loved being Mrs. J. Fred Schlafly. She felt strongly that feminism and its empty promises were ruining the sacred bond between husband and wife. Phyllis Schlafly was Mrs. Schlafly and it is an honor to call her Mrs. America. She was our Mrs. America \u2013 representing women who considered their most important job to be a wife and mother.\n\nI learned from my mother that, no matter the odds, I could achieve. I am often asked, \u201cdid your mother teach you how to cook?\u201d Yes. and she taught me so much more: How to think, behave and write. She taught me to stand up straight and to stand up for myself. She taught me never to be intimidated by anyone \u2013 including herself. And I never was intimidated by my mother.\n\nIf there is a criticism that rings true, many people considered Phyllis herself to be very intimidating. True, she was always firm and confident in her convictions, which made some on the outside looking in, uneasy. But to those who knew her, she was never intimidating because she welcomed frank conversations. She was adept at mentoring and encouraging young women. She did not stand on ceremony but expected that everyone would call her \u201cPhyllis.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nMy mother\u2019s life has and always will be a role model for women.

Sign up here.\n\nPresident Trump has said that deciding when to reopen the economy will be the biggest and most difficult one he will make in his presidency.\n\nNo one can deny the world is facing the most prolific challenge in our lifetimes. Since World War II, we as a nation have never faced decisions of global consequence like the ones we are facing today. Yes, there have been conflicts abroad, terrorists\u2019 actions at home and even previous epidemics, but for nearly everyone alive today, we have never been asked as a country to make the really hard decisions this global pandemic now requires.\n\nThe decision Trump has to make is not as simple as the health care community or the governors of our states make it out to be. The decision is much more complex and the stakes are higher.\n\nCAL THOMAS: CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE \u2014 REASONS TO STAY POSITIVE, EVEN NOW\n\nIn many respects, we are in the midst of a multi-front war. One is battling the virus, but others are perhaps even more dangerous; preserving the economy \u2013 and preserving our freedoms. And beyond the clich\u00e9 that the cure could be worse than the disease, America\u2019s retreat from the world economy will cause untold death and turmoil across the globe.\n\nPrime Minister Winston Churchill made the difficult decision to fight on after the fall of France and not pursue, as some suggested, a negotiated settlement with Nazi Germany. He undoubtedly knew it would lead to incalculably more death and destruction. Yet, if preservation of life was the only consideration, perhaps capitulating to Nazi Germany would have been the easier decision.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt looked crisis in the eye and sent countless young, brave men to storm the beaches of Normandy to free a continent half a world away, and in doing so, preserved our freedoms as well.\n\nDo we as a nation have the courage for tough decisions? Are we mindful of the fragility of our prosperity and our liberties? Would we as Americans be willing to pay that price or sacrifice that much if those decisions of the past fell into the court of public opinion today?\n\nThe book, \u201cLessons in Tragedy,\u201d by Hal Brands and Charles Edel, gives us historical examples of how easily cultures have descended into violence and war. Further catastrophes were only averted by taking difficult, and understandably controversial, actions. The authors argue that America needs a \u201ctragic sensibility\u201d in order to address the dangers we face both domestically and internationally.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThere are far graver consequences which we as a nation will face long term if we don\u2019t make those same tough decisions of history and embrace our own sense of tragic sensibility by changing course soon and reopening sectors of our economy in a safe and strategic way.\n\nIt was our industry, our economy and the arsenal of democracy that helped win World War II. In fact, the United States was the only nation to see its economy grow during the war. It was this same U.S. industry that allowed the execution of the post-war Marshall Plan and the formation of most of the global institutions that have led to the prosperity of the last 75 years.\n\nThat same economy will be what propels our recovery following this crisis, but it cannot do so if it remains in a self-induced coma. It\u2019s time to wake America\u2019s sleeping giant of economic growth \u2013 before it\u2019s too late.\n\nAnother front of this war involves not only preserving life, but also preserving our very way of life. From every side, we are under attack by China and their execution of unrestricted warfare \u2013 a strategy that describes winning a global war against the United States without ever firing a shot.\n\nMuch has already been written about China\u2019s role in the coronavirus and concerns about lack of transparency, with much still to uncover. However, one thing is irrefutable. China is taking advantage of the crisis, profiting from the outbreak, continuing their predatory mercantilism and accelerating the provision of goods and services to many suffering from the pandemic, such as sending 1,000 ventilators to New York City and attempting to re-sell to Italy some of the very products Italy donated to China.\n\nChina is also buying up distressed assets around the globe. The virus has become China\u2019s economic weapon to destroy the economies of the U.S. and its allies. So far, it has worked, but it has to stop. Immediately.\n\nPart of winning the fight on this front is pushing back on China with the full weight of the American economy, not just for ourselves, but for a world that also looks to our strength for their strength, security and stability. We need to win this war on many fronts: restarting the engine of industry and preserving the values and freedoms of our country, while also protecting ourselves against further exploitation by an ever-aggressive China. If we allow ourselves to make decisions based exclusively on limiting or eliminating potential American loss of life, we are fighting this war on only one front, which is a flawed and short-sighted strategy. We owe more to our nation, and to the world.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s instincts are correct, and many of the steps our president has taken have been bold, brave and infused with informed guidance and personal wisdom. We need to support the president in making the tough, correct decision to reopen our economy as soon as it is safe to do so. This is not an either/or decision between choosing life or livelihood. Those are two parts of a complex, achievable balance that will protect our liberties as Americans and recalibrate our relationship with China.\n\nThis is the perfect equilibrium our president must find, and we all must support, knowing there will continue to be risks, but being willing to assume those risks together.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM PEGGY GRANDE", "author": ["Peggy Grande", "Peggy Grande Is Chair Of", "Author Of"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/hg00R4_vOVo/sen-martha-mcsally-coronavirus-will-be-defeated-by-health-care-heroes-we-need-to-get-them-needed-supplies", "published": "2020-04-15T10:00:22", "title": "Sen.

These shortages have put doctors, nurses, and other front line workers at a greater risk of contracting the coronavirus, raising anxiety among medical professionals as they treat an increasing number of patients.\n\nStill, these heroes power through.\n\nIn my home state of Arizona, doctors and nurses have made the tough decision of isolating from their own families amid personal protective equipment shortages as they work around the clock to keep families safe.\n\nScottsdale cardiac anesthesiologist Reza Kharrazi recently shared a video to rally his staff and other health care workers in the state who are anxious about their own exposure to the virus.\n\nSome doctors have even gotten creative.

As you adjust to this new work environment, you\u2019ll likely encounter some unexpected hurdles along the way.\n\nDistractions. Lots of distractions. And they\u2019re coming from all directions.\n\nOther adults in your household working from home with you?\n\nKids at home due to school closures?\n\nConstant Slack messages or emails from your colleagues?\n\nContinuous Twitter notifications with the latest COVID-19 updates?\n\nPeople and technology are taking over your time and your productivity takes a nosedive as a result.\n\nOne study found that people are distracted every 11 minutes. In light of today\u2019s crisis, imagine how that frequency has increased.\n\nYou need to find a solution and get back on track. Fast.\n\nThe RAIN Group Center for Sales Research conducted a study on Extreme Productivity to understand what drives productivity. After analyzing data from more than 5,000 professionals, we found that extremely productive people (The XP) achieve better results than everyone else (The Rest) by following three keys. One of them being: Control Your TIME.\n\nTo do this and combat all the distractions you\u2019re currently facing, adopt Habit No. 6 \u201cPlay Hard to Get\u201d from the 9 Habits of Extreme Productivity.\n\nWe were already living in a world of distraction and now we\u2019re dealing with a whole new set of culprits. Here are three hacks from Habit No. 6 to minimize the disruptions and signal that you\u2019re not available.\n\n1. Be free from the shackles of alerts.\n\nYou might be experiencing an uptick in the number of messages you\u2019re receiving now that you\u2019re working from home. While communication is crucial, it\u2019s also important to set boundaries so it doesn\u2019t hinder your productivity.\n\nRelated: 4 Productivity Tips That Changed My Life This Year\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re working on an important report that a client requested and one of your colleagues is firing off Slack messages. Do you stop what you\u2019re doing and respond? Or do you continue working on your client report?\n\nThe XP stay focused on their tasks. How do they do this? They signal that they\u2019re not available by turning off their alerts. According to our research, The XP turn off their alerts 1.8 times more frequently than The Rest.\n\nThere are things you can do to let colleagues know that you\u2019re busy and not just blowing them off.\n\nIf you\u2019re on Slack, pause notifications and add a note in your status update of when you\u2019ll be available. There are pre-set times starting at 30 minutes and go to four hours. You can also create a custom time notification.\n\nAre you getting bombarded with emails? Compose an internal out-of-office message letting your team know that you\u2019re focusing on a priority issue and you\u2019ll respond when you have a chance. If it\u2019s an emergency, they can call you.\n\nA 2018 Deloitte study revealed that people check their phones 52 times a day. And that wasn\u2019t during a global pandemic. If you can\u2019t stop checking your phone, put it in a drawer or in another room so you can concentrate.\n\nDon\u2019t let technology and alerts steal your focus.\n\n2. Signal \u201cDo Not Disturb.\u201d\n\nWorking from home with other adults, kids and even pets around can be very challenging.\n\nI get it. My wife and I are both working from home and have two young children and a dog.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to escape those distractions, you can signal that you\u2019re not available. The XP signal \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d 3.4 times more frequently than The Rest.\n\nRelated: 6 Ways Daily Exercise Skyrockets Your Productivity\n\nThis can be accomplished by practicing any of these strategies:\n\nClose your door: While adults know this indicates you\u2019re busy, make sure you explain it to children so you don\u2019t end up like Professor Robert Kelly did during his live interview on BBC News.\n\nUse headphones: Put on headphones even if you\u2019re not listening to anything. This will indicate you\u2019re focused on something else. For anyone who is familiar with our personal journey, you know living from the hospital for over a year was terribly distracting. But when I had downtime and could get some work done in the hospital lounge, I\u2019d put on my daughter\u2019s Princess Leia buns headphones. People assumed I was listening to something and didn\u2019t interrupt me. Worked like a charm.\n\nPut up a sign: If you\u2019re trying to focus, place a sign on your door letting others know that you\u2019re busy and to only interrupt you if it\u2019s an emergency.\n\nImplementing any of these \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d tips should help you concentrate and get more done.\n\n3. Be someplace else if you want to be productive.\n\nIf you\u2019re working from home, you likely already have a designated workspace. But with the countless distractions and different schedules of those around you, this spot might not currently be the most productive place to work.\n\nIf you normally work in an office, you could move to an open conference room or go to a coffee shop. But that\u2019s not possible today.\n\nFor instance, if I\u2019m not able to work at my desk, near the playroom, I move to the outdoor patio table to escape the noise. If the sun\u2019s out, getting some vitamin D is an extra bonus.\n\nRelated: 5 Daily Habits That Will Increase Your Productivity Levels\n\nConsider different areas around your home where you can move should you need to switch things up and focus.\n\nCurrent times are challenging.

Not only have there been daily updates and changes by either the SBA, the Treasury Department or the IRS, but we are on the precipice of Congress passing another bill because the plan is running out of money.\n\nBusiness owners have been frantically trying to keep up with the changes, to the point of exasperation due to information overload or because of the complexity in all the hoops they have to jump through to get any money.\n\nI started presenting my analysis of the CARES Act with eight options for business owners, but in light of subsequent changes and modifications, I've expanded that guidance to 10.\n\nBut first, here is a summary what we have learned since the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was rolled out:\n\nThe PPP equation is not as simple as the SBA would like to think. It seems almost every bank has a different way of calculating it.\n\nThe sole-proprietor Schedule C business owner has had to wait a lot longer than expected to even apply for the PPP, with a tremendous amount of confusion as to what banks are requiring.\n\nUnemployment benefits are not being doled out to small-business owners as promised because states are confused as to how to work with business owners lost compensation, or they are simply overwhelmed with the number of applicants for unemployment.\n\nTo make matters worse, the original $350 billion appears to have ran outm and there are still thousands of business owners in flux with applications pending.\n\nFinally, on the bright side, the Employee Retention Credit and Payroll Tax Deferral strategies (previously even barely discussed) are evolving to be credible strategies for business owners who can\u2019t use the PPP.\n\nBottomline, more and more experts, as well as average Americans, are realizing it\u2019s going to take years to dig out of this financial mess. For business owners to get as much financial help as possible from all of the legislation being passed, it\u2019s critical to not just hyper-focus on the two primary loans: The Econiomic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and PPP (more below).\n\nA wise business owner with different types of operations could find that a combination of several strategies could help their business, their employees, themselves and their family. Also, just because you think you are a smaller operation without \u201cemployees,\u201d don\u2019t think that unemployment benefits or the Paid Sick Leave provision wouldn\u2019t apply to you. If you have the right structure, there might be thousands of dollars sitting on the table just waiting for the taking.\n\nHere are the 10 topics \u2014 each of which we will break down in greater detail \u2014 you should at least familiarize yourself with when putting together a strategic plan and meeting with your advisors:\n\nStimulus Checks Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Paycheck Protection Porgram (PPP) SBA Loan Forbearance Increased Access to Retirement Accounts Unemployment Paid Sick Leave Family Medical Leave (FMLA) Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) Payroll Tax Deferral (PTD)\n\nAs an additional warning or cautionary point, please keep in mind that there are scam artists all over the web offering to get you money for a fee. Be very careful, know who you are working with, and don\u2019t give any money in advance to someone promising dollars or success.\n\nRelated: $205 Billion of the $350 Billion Appropriated for PPP Loans Has Been Claimed\n\nAt the very least, work with licensed individuals who have a legitimate presence as a professional such as a CPA or attorney. Get a second opinion if something sounds fishy, and remember: You are the captain of your ship. Understand which way you are headed and why!\n\nNow, back to those 10 essential topics....\n\n1. Stimulus Checks\n\nEvery business owner is a citizen first, and it\u2019s important that if you qualify for a stimulus payment you should do what you can to get this shot in the arm, financially speaking, as quickly as possible.\n\nHere are the problems we have seen or heard of from our clients who are receiving, or not receiving, their funds:\n\nThe IRS is first doing bank transfers to taxpayers for whom they have banking information on in the IRS computer system. These transfers started on April 9.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t filed in 2018 or 2019 for a refund and submitted banking information on file with the IRS, you\u2019re going to have to wait for a paper check. Non-filers can update their banking info here.\n\nDue to the outcry of so many Americans not wanting to wait for the infamous \"check in the mail,\" the IRS is creating a webpage where you can update your banking info. It\u2019s supposed to be available any day now, and you can also go here to check the status of your payment and apply to update your banking info.\n\nIf you were divorced in 2018 or 2019 and the IRS doesn\u2019t know your filing status or where you live, file ASAP, or you might be fighting things out with your ex when they get the check and you don't.\n\nPaper checks will be sent through the mail over a 10-week timeframe beginning sometime in April, and according to the legislation the IRS has until the end of 2020 to transfer the payments.\n\nFinally, if the IRS doesn\u2019t have your correct mailing address, you may want to go here to update your mailing address with the IRS.\n\nJust as a reminder, the payments will be $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for married couples and an extra $500 for each child younger than 18. Unfortunately, that\u2019s when things get complicated....\n\nSingle individuals won\u2019t get the payment if making more than $99,000 (starts phasing out at $75,000).\n\nMarried couples making more than $198,000 won\u2019t get a check either (starts phasing out at $150,000).\n\nAnd one last reminder, this isn\u2019t \"free money\" for some taxpayers. For accounting purposes, the IRS is essentially treating this as an \"overpayment\" on your 2019 tax return. So if you haven\u2019t filed your 2019 tax return, and you get a refund based on your 2018 filing, but then come to find out you really didn\u2019t qualify for the payment based on your 2019 filing and got the check anyway, the IRS is going to expect that money back on your 2020 return (at least that is what they are saying the plan is).\n\nThe Takeaway: Make sure your address is up to date with the IRS, you have filed a 2018 or 2019 return, and if you haven\u2019t been claiming your children over age 18 on your return previously, have them file a simple return for 2019 immediately.\n\n2. EIDLs\n\nThis little gem in the stimulus package has been the biggest disappointment so far. Millions of business owners and rental property owners ran straight away to www.sba.gov to file for EIDL (as I did as well), only to discover they wasted their time. Many are going to get very little, if not nothing at all.\n\nThe original \"promise\" was $10,000 to every business owner in the form of an easily forgivable loan, to the point they were simply calling it a grant. All of us were looking forward to this immediate benefit to help us through a very difficult time.\n\nNow, it has been modified in two significant ways:\n\nFirst, there is confusion as to whether it\u2019s a loan or grant. It\u2019s now being referred to as an \"Advance\" on the borrower's EIDL, and any discussion of forgiveness is conspicuously missing in certain updates. But then in other statements by the SBA, they\u2019re saying it does not need to be repaid. Yes, it\u2019s confusing, and we\u2019re advising our clients to wait and see if they get the $$.\n\nneed to be repaid. Yes, it\u2019s confusing, and we\u2019re advising our clients to wait and see if they get the $$. The biggest blow was that the advance was significantly reduced and will only provide $1,000 per employee (based on your pre-disaster employees as of January 31, 2020). These payments are up to a maximum of $10,000, and it\u2019s devastating to rental-property owners who will be losing rent due to the crisis and don\u2019t have employees on the payroll.\n\nIt\u2019s also become clear that the \"long-term loan\" portion, or the traditional EIDL we're all familiar with, is no longer looking as rosy as originally promised. Dreams of obtaining a loan up to $200,000 with no personal guarantee or collateral, disappeared quickly.\n\nThe SBA has historically offered many favorable terms in their EIDLs, with loans are up to $2 million, 30-year terms and 3.75 percent interest. But again, we\u2019ll see how many small business owners actually qualify for these loans when it\u2019s all said and done.\n\nFinally, it is true that small business owners can apply or both the EIDL and PPP. However, the EIDL funds will reduce the amount forgiven under the PPP if both amounts would qualify for forgiveness (this is another mathematical demonstration yet to be fully explained or seen until the forgiveness process actually begins).\n\nYou can start immediately and apply for these loans directly through the SBA at www.sba.gov. and there is no need to make an appointment with a banker to start the loan process. In fact, we have had several people call our office who thought they had applied for the PPP because they went to the SBA website and believed the EIDL and PPP were the same thing \u2014 or at the least you applied in the same place. Wrong! The EIDL is applied for at the SBA website directly, while the PPP must be applied for through a banker (more below).\n\nThe Takeaway: Still apply for the EIDL if you think you qualify, OR if you are interested in a long-term loan and believe it\u2019s the best move for your business or rental property. If you choose not to take or use the money, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to decide that later. But if you don\u2019t apply, you\u2019ll never have the option.\n\n3. PPP Loans\n\nThis loan is great if you fit into the parameters provided by the government, and it\u2019s not wise to assume you\u2019ll receive 100 percent forgiveness of the money you receive. You must understand what you are doing and not depend on anyone blindly to guide you through this process.\n\nWe are learning more and more and instructing our clients on this point that it\u2019s critical they understand how the numbers work and what they need to spend the money on it order to have it forgiven.\n\nBut let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Getting the money in the first place is turning out to be very challenging for hundreds of thousands of business owners around the country. Don\u2019t think you are alone if you feel like you are hitting your head against the wall in this process.\n\nOn the face of it, one may think it\u2019s a simple equation and all the banks should be on the same page with the application and documentation. This is certainly not the case. Congress truly did intend for all business owners affected by COVID-19 to apply for and get at least something under this program, but it\u2019s been one problem after another trying help the business owner through the process.\n\nHere are the basics and the process that we\u2019re supposed to follow:\n\nIn order to qualify, a business must have fewer than 500 employees, show that it was in business on or before February 15, 2020 and can certify that the business has been economically affected by the coronavirus, or even that economic uncertainty makes the loan necessary.\n\nThe loan is up to $10 million, but the amount each business gets is based on its payroll costs. The amount you qualify for is based on 2.5 times your average monthly payroll costs. Your monthly average payroll is calculated based on your prior 12 months of payroll. Take the average monthly payroll number and multiply it by 2.5. For example, if your monthly average payroll was $20,000, then you would qualify for a $50,000 PPP loan.\n\nThe true beauty of this loan is that if you use the money for payroll, rent, mortgage obligations, utilities and other fixed-debt obligations in the first eight weeks after the loan funds, the debt is completely forgiven!\n\nWhatever funds you don\u2019t get forgiven convert to a two-year loan that is nearly interest-free. The bill allowed for a maximum rate of 4 percent, but the guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury is stating that the maximum rate would be 0.5 percent.\n\nHowever, proving your payroll to bankers has been a hodgepodge of document requests ranging from tax returns, to P&Ls, to 941s, to W-3s and everything under the sun. One bank in particular requested from a client of ours a full SBA 7(a) application \u2014 not what Congress intended.\n\nNext, for the business owner operating as a sole proprietor with a Schedule C, it\u2019s proved tremendously problematic, if not impossible, to get the PPP process started. One moment, the SBA said the sole proprietors could apply, the next they said they had to wait, and then they didn\u2019t tell the bankers what information they should ask for in order to fill out the application. From the outset, bankers's heads were already spinning with the simple two-page application for S-Corps and C-Corps and pushed off sole proprietors because they were swamped anyway.\n\nHere\u2019s what we have learned about the PPP and need to consider\n\nBusiness owners operating as S-Corps with traditional payroll reports are receiving PPP money already and loving it. The problem is, the SBA has ran out out of money (or only now we hope), and those who were in line first got their funds. Everyone else is praying and hoping Congress approves more money.\n\nNext, business owners who received their PPP now have eight weeks to spend the money on payroll and specific expenses, but if they are in a state with a shelter in place order, many are struggling on how to open their doors and get employees back to work before the eight weeks run out. Go figure.\n\nFinally, if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, the equation of what you get and what will be forgiven is still extremely complex at best. The SBA has contradicted themselves several times, and frankly who even knows what the final application to get funds forgiven will look like? Even though the SBA feels they\u2019re clear and keep sending out guidance almost daily, the bankers can\u2019t keep up with it and in many cases are authorizing more PPP money than may be forgiven.\n\nWhat can Sole Proprietors do now?\n\nOne piece of good news is that the SBA provided an Interim Final Rule for Sole Proprietors with guidance on how to apply for the PPP. Bankers jumped on this like a hot potato (I have an office in Idaho, so I can use that analogy).\n\nSimply stated, there are essentially two equations for sole proprietors to use when applying for the PPP:\n\nSole Proprietors with no employees take their net-income reported on their 2019 Schedule C, divide it by 12 and then multiply it by 2.5. That\u2019s it! That\u2019s your PPP loan. There isn\u2019t any consideration in the process for health- insurance premiums paid or contributions to their retirement accounts. For Sole Proprietors with employees, they take their net income reported on their 2019 Schedule C, add back to it any payroll costs for outside third-party employees in 2019, add any health insurance premiums paid for on the employee\u2019s behalf, add any matching retirement plan contributions paid by the business for the employee, then take the total and divide it by 12, multiply the result by 5 ... and there\u2019s your PPP loan.\n\nThe biggest issue to remember? None of this happens, nor does the application even get underway, until the sole proprietor files their 2019 1040 Schedule C. Based on SBA guidance, the bankers are requiring the tax return to do the math for your PPP.\n\nMore to come in the weeks to come regarding the application for forgiveness that needs to be presented to the banker eight weeks from when you receive the money. This process of forgiveness is very important (obviously), and math is actually quite complex with a 75 percent/25 percent test. But again, the good news is at least some money is flowing out into business owners's bank accounts, and we all hope the economy starts to show some life.\n\nThe Takeaway: Determine if the PPP works for your business, and do so by calculating the numbers on your payroll for the past 12 months. If it looks like the program could work for you, immediately contact an SBA-qualified loan officer at a bank and get the application process started. If you are a sole proprietor, hurry and file your 2019 1040 and accompanying Schedule C, then go see your banker ASAP. Get in line as soon as you can if you are seeking the PPP loan and have a consult with a professional while you wait for the PPP.\n\n4. SBA Loan Forbearance\n\nNo major updates here. In fact, we have had many many positive reports from our clients around the country that SBA loan payments are being made for them by the banks, and it\u2019s been a huge relief to many business owners.\n\nSome of you may already have one or more SBA loans in your business that you used for equipment, expansion or even real estate, including your own building. If this happens to be a SBA 7(a), 504 or Micro loan, the CARES Act requires the government to automatically make the payments for you over the next six-month period beginning April 1, 2020.\n\nI use the word forbearance because it\u2019s a unique program and not simply a payment holiday. The government will literally cover payments, including principal and interest, for the next six months. At the end of that time, your mortgage balance will be reduced, your credit will not be affected, you don\u2019t have to claim the payments made on your behalf as income, and you are back to your regular payment cycle.\n\nIn fact, in my own particular situation (I have an SBA 504 loan), my lender sent me an email that I didn\u2019t even have to apply for the benefit. It was automatic!\n\nThe Takeaway: Don\u2019t wait and hope your bank sends you an email or letter stating your SBA loan is in forbearance. If you haven\u2019t heard from your loan officer by now, or the bank, and you have the proper SBA loan that qualifies, reach out to everyone involved and make sure this happens.\n\n5. Increased Access to Retirement Accounts\n\nAgain, no major updates here either, and the rules haven\u2019t changed since the passage of the CARES Act. This is still proving to be a great strategy in the short run to access cash while you wait for other benefits, but may not be a good strategy in the long run.\n\nTapping into your retirement accounts, or some might say \"raiding\" your future savings and retirement, is a very dangerous proposition. If you asked me whether it was a good idea for you, you'd better sell me on one of two points: 1. You are going to use the money in the short run and pay it back through your EIDL or PPP loans, or 2. Your business is so amazing that this loan is a no-brainer. If not, I would think twice or three times before you touch that sacred money.\n\nNow, assuming you need to use your retirement money, the new CARES Act gave some wonderful benefits and perks on how to access it:\n\nIncreased loan provisions for 401k. First, the new law increases the dollar amount you can loan yourself from your own 401(k) from $50,000 to $100,000. Historically, it\u2019s been 50 percent of your account value, or $50,000, whichever is less. There are no taxes or penalties owned when you take the loan, and so long as you pay the loan back, it's a tax- and penalty-free opportunity to access your own retirement savings early. You have five years to pay back the 401(k) loan, and it must be paid back in substantially level payments, at least quarterly, within five years. A lump-sum payment at the end of the loan is not acceptable. The interest rate for 401(k) loans is currently 5.25 percent. By law, the interest rate to be charged is a \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d rate. This has been interpreted by the industry and the IRS/DOL to be prime plus 2 percent (prime is currently 3.25 percent).\n\nFirst, the new law increases the dollar amount you can loan yourself from your own 401(k) from $50,000 to $100,000.

This has been interpreted by the industry and the IRS/DOL to be prime plus 2 percent (prime is currently 3.25 percent). Penalty-free distributions from any retirement account. Next, the new law also creates a penalty-free early distribution rule whereby taxpayers under age 59-and-a-half can take a penalty-free account distribution from their retirement account of up to $100,000. This includes IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, 401(k)s, pension plans, 457 plans and 403(b) plans. The 10 percent early withdrawal penalty is waived, but you are taxed on traditional funds distributed. However, the special distribution provision allows you to pay back the retirement account over a three-year period. You can make multiple payments back to the account or one lump-sum payment to the account by the end of the three-year window. This is an excellent option, as it allows those who can get back on their feet financially to return the funds to their retirement account. And if you do, you\u2019ll avoid any taxes on the distribution. The penalty-free distribution option is available on qualifying distributions made from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Takeaway: Review all of your account balances in your retirement accounts and decide if you really need the cash and if it\u2019s worth it to access these accounts. If so, get in touch with your account custodian, broker or administrator as quickly as you can to get the process started.\n\n6. Unemployment Benefits for the Self-Employed\n\nThis has been a nightmare for thousands of small-business owners. States are simply not prepared for the type of paperwork a small business owner will submit to verify their income during the same period a typical applicant would be providing a cancelled check or W-2.\n\nWe have had clients across the country get rejected for unemployment benefits and others fly right through with success. The most important takeaway is to not give up! If you deserve benefits, keep fighting with the state. Make sure you have your 2019 1040 Schedule C filed, and jump through any hoops necessary to prove what you made last year so the state agency can try and calculate your unemployment benefit.\n\nBefore I get to the steps and strategies you could employ to get unemployment benefits, it\u2019s important to know what the benefits are. You want to do the calculations and determine the cost benefit of different strategies under the CARES Act, including unemployment.\n\nSome of our clients are walking away from the business for three-to-four months and claiming unemployment, while others are applying for the PPP but having their spouse or family members claim unemployment because they were previously on the payroll of the business.\n\nSo in order to do the math and properly consider if seeking unemployment benefits is worth it, here are the amazing provisions of the new law:\n\nState unemployment benefits have been expanded by an additional 13 weeks, for a total of 39 weeks. Regular state unemployment eligibility is typically 26 weeks. Benefits can range from $200-$550 a week, depending on the state.\n\nNext, the federal government is giving out $600 a week, in addition to the state benefit. But in order to get the federal benefit, you first must be approved for state unemployment.\n\nThe Federal benefit lasts for up to 12 weeks and ends by July 31, 2020 (if it isn\u2019t extended under a forthcoming fourth iteration of the Stimulus Act).\n\nNext, here are the basic steps to pursue unemployment if you decide to move forward. Please know that these can vary depending on your situation and the state you live in, but they are certainly a great place to start:\n\nIf you have rank-and-file employees you had to furlough or terminate, it\u2019s up to them to claim unemployment, which they probably will. Did you have any family members on your payroll (W-2), not 1099 subs, over the past year? If yes, you want to determine if it\u2019s best to keep them on payroll or let them claim unemployment.\n\nIf you decide to claim unemployment, we\u2019ll go to Step 4. Are you as the business owner completely stepping away from the business and have no other sources of earned income? Meaning is the business not making a profit, or you are completely shutting it down? If yes, then move onto Step 4. Research your state requirements for qualifying for employment. This means determining the base period for which an employee must have worked, how much they received and what the benefits would be. Decide if it\u2019s worth applying. If you are a sole proprietorship, get your 2019 1040 filed (with your Schedule C) as quickly as you can. Get your application in for state unemployment. This is required. In order to get the federal \"kicker\" of $600 a week, you first must be approved for state unemployment and receive that benefit as stated above.\n\nIndividuals who haven\u2019t been laid off or can\u2019t work due to a variety of reasons related to the coronavirus would also be eligible for unemployment checks. These reasons would include a case where they were diagnosed with coronavirus, were awaiting a diagnosis or had a family member diagnosed with the disease.\n\nThe Takeaway: Remember, \"unemployment\" really means being \"unemployed.\" You can't continue to work your business or have any other income if you are going to try and qualify for unemployment benefits. Start with Steps 1 and 2 above and see if unemployment benefits could work for your small business and family circle.\n\n7. Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL)\n\nWhen President Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the new law now required certain employers to provide EPSL in certain circumstances. It takes effect on April 2, 2020 and will expire on December 31, 2020.\n\nThis is an unheard-of law that\u2019s never been on the books before. Essentially, qualifying employees (see the six reasons below) can receive paid leave for up to two weeks in advance (while not working), and the federal government will pay for it.\n\nOnly employers with fewer than 500 employees, including public agencies, are required to provide the EPSL benefit. The law also allows for subsequent Department of Labor regulations to exempt small businesses with fewer than 50 employees if applying these provisions would jeopardize the viability of the business.\n\nKeep in mind, the EPSL doesn\u2019t cost employers anything! Once benefits are paid, employers simply apply for a full, 100 percent reimbursement and receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit against any payroll taxes paid with their quarterly payroll reports.\n\nIf employees qualify under one of six reasons (see below), they can receive benefits in the following amounts:\n\nTwo weeks (80 hours) of pay, immediately (not after they come back) paid at their regular rate of pay, for reasons 1-3 below (employee is sick with COVID-19). This is at a maximum of $511 a day and $5,110 in total. Two weeks (80 hours) of pay, immediately (again, not after they come back to work) paid at two-thirds their regular rate of pay, for reasons 4-6 below (caregiver reasons). This is at a maximum of $200 a day and $2,000 in total.\n\nIn order to qualify, employees must show the inability to work or telework due to any of the following:\n\nThe employee is subject to a federal, state or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19. The employee has been advised by a healthcare provider to self-quarantine because of COVID-19. The employee is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and is seeking a medical diagnosis. The employee is caring for an individual (not limited to a family member) subject to a quarantine or isolation order or advised to quarantine or isolation. The employee is caring for a son or daughter whose school or place of care is closed or childcare provider is unavailable, due to COVID-19 precautions. The employee is experiencing any other substantially similar conditions as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor (a catch-all!).\n\nIncredibly, the sick-leave provision applies to all employees, regardless of length of service.\n\nThe Takeaway: If you have a spouse or family member on the payroll, and they qualify under one of the above six reasons, they could receive two week\u2019s pay, and all it costs you is the employment taxes. That\u2019s close to $5,000 of free money. Just remember to be honest and keep good records if you make the claim.\n\nRelated: Entrepreneurs Review the SBA PPP Loan-Application Process\n\n8. FMLA Benefits\n\nThe new CARES Act also dramatically expands FMLA benefits. This portion of the law was passed to give employees compensation and the necessary time to take care of a family member effected by the virus. It also takes effect on April 2, 2020 and will expire on December 31, 2020.\n\nEssentially, if an employee qualifies, it allows the employee up to 12 weeks of paid leave, and the employer is reimbursed up to certain limits and amounts.\n\nAgain, not all companies will participate, as this law only applies to employers with fewer than 500 employees, including public agencies. However, employers of an employee who is a healthcare provider or an emergency responder can elect to exclude the employee from this FMLA provision. The law also allows for subsequent Department of Labor regulations to exempt small businesses with fewer than 50 employees if applying these provisions would jeopardize the viability of the business.\n\nThis is limited to an employee who cannot work or telework due to the need to care for the employee\u2019s minor son or daughter if the minor child\u2019s school or place of childcare has been closed, or the childcare provider is unavailable due to a public-health emergency with respect to COVID-19 declared by a federal, state or local authority. Basically, it is caregiver leave.\n\nUnlike EPSL, under the FMLA provision, only full- and part-time employees who have been on the employer\u2019s payroll for 30 days are eligible.\n\nThe first 10 days (two weeks) are unpaid, but an employee can substitute accrued paid leave, including the new EPSL. The remaining leave (a maximum of 10 weeks, as the total available is still 12 weeks) is paid at two-thirds the employee\u2019s regular rate, for the number of hours the employee would be otherwise scheduled to work. This pay is capped at $200 a day and $10,000 total.\n\nFinally, under the expanded FMLA provision, the employee must be restored to the same or equivalent position. However, there is an exception for employers with fewer than 25 employees, if the employee\u2019s position no longer exists due to operational changes related to the public-health emergency, such as a reduction in force or restructuring because of a downturn in business. Essentially, an employer cannot retaliate against an employee for exercising his or her rights under these new laws. You will also have to post a notice detailing these laws, and the Department of Labor is in the process of drafting that notice.\n\nThe Takeaway: If you have had a spouse or family member on the payroll for at least 30 days, and they qualify for paid FMLA, this could be another perfect fit for your business while you as the business owner continue to get paid under the PPP.\n\n9. The ERTC\n\nThe Employee Retention Tax Credit benefit under the CARES Act was initially ignored by many business owners and business advisors, primarily because it can\u2019t be used in conjunction with the PPP. Obviously, the big money is with the PPP if a business owner can qualify and the money doesn\u2019t run out. However, it\u2019s also reasonable to presume that the PPP isn\u2019t for everyone. That\u2019s where the ERTC comes in.\n\nThe ERTC is easy to understand, calculate and implement. Here are the basics.\n\nOnly businesses with less than 100 employees are eligible for the program without limitations on the number of hours worked by the employee.\n\nIt\u2019s a refundable payroll tax credit of 50 percent of up to $10,000 in wages per employee (including health care premiums), essentially $5,000 per employee.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be paid back, easy to claim and applies to all payroll between 3/12/20 and 12/31/20.\n\nS-Corp owners can use the credit on their own personal payroll paid to themselves or any other legitimate employees under the business, whether they are family members or not.\n\nThe ERTC is fully refundable, and it is applied to the portion of payroll taxes paid by the employer. The IRS also allowing eligible businesses to receive an advance payment on their credit. According to the IRS website, there are two ways an employer can qualify. They must: 1. fully or partially suspend operations at any point during 2020 due to a coronavirus government mandate, or 2. Show a significant decline in gross receipts during a calendar quarter in 2020. To qualify under this requirement, gross receipts of any given quarter must be less than 50 percent of the gross receipts of the same quarter in 2019.\n\nBut again, if a business owner received a loan under the PPP, they can\u2019t take advantage of the ERTC.\n\nWhere we\u2019re seeing this as a viable option, much simpler and less risky than the PPP that may not be entirely forgiven, is when we have a smaller family owned S-Corp. If the owner is taking $40,000 or less in payroll, and may have their spouse on payroll as well, the ERC would help the business owner more financially than the PPP.\n\nThe Takeaway: Don\u2019t jump on the bandwagon of the PPP lock, stock, and barrel before running the numbers on the ERTC, especially if you have total payroll last year of $50,000 and maybe 2-3 employees.\n\n10. The Payroll Tax Deferral (PTD)\n\nThe beauty of the PTD is that can be used in conjunction with the ERTC. It\u2019s essentially an interest-free loan from the IRS and allows business owners to defer their share of FICA, specifically the 6.2 percent Social Security tax if an employer, or half of their self-employment tax if a sole proprietor. Here are the principle benefits:\n\nThe deferral of payroll tax applies to wages paid or self-employment income between 3/27/20 and 12/31/20.\n\nFifty percent of whatever amount of payroll tax during this period the business owner decides to defer is due 12/31/21.\n\nThe remaining amount of tax is due 12/31/22.\n\nThe IRS will revise Form 941 for the second quarter of 2020 to accommodate employers who make this election. In no case will employers be required to make a special election to be able to defer deposits and payments.\n\nAgain, taxpayers who elect to participate and receive funds under the PPP are ineligible to participate in the PTD.\n\nOur firm feels that this is a very dangerous game to play with the IRS. Payroll-tax deposits are the most sacred of funds in the eyes of the IRS. and if a business owner gets behind on these payments it can be disastrous.\n\nThe Takeaway: We strongly recommend clients consider the gravity of pushing these payments off into the future and better see a bright future for the business. Not being able to make these payments in the future could snowball into a problem that many business owners never recover from. Be careful.\n\nIn summary, please realize that changes are happening daily as we all navigate rough waters, and we are doing our best to keep our clients, and even non-clients, up-to-date by publishing more videos, podcasts and articles. We pray your family will be blessed with health safety and success. Hang on!\n\nMark J.

When you ask yourself, 'What\u2019s my personal take on this topic?' and take the time to develop an original answer, you begin to find clarity around what you believe in. What you want to stand for. And perhaps, what your purpose is. We all want to be able to look back and say, 'yes, that was a life well-lived.' To get there takes some reflection, examination, and development of our personal belief systems.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, thought leadership is a huge competitive differentiation. No one can replicate authenticity and it\u2019s sure hard to steal someone\u2019s mission!\n\nAs a mission-driven brand, thought leadership is a key part of building the business, staying connected with our key stakeholders and meeting new customers.\n\nGreat thought leadership also leads to engaged communities of people who relate to your belief system, and they become the best kinds of customers. By way of example, every Tuesday and Thursday we do Inaugurations on Instagram Live, where our team welcomes each new loved one to the Eterneva family and shares their incredible stories with our followers. We do this because we believe remarkable people shouldn\u2019t be forgotten, yet interestingly this tradition has brought us many new customers, because they love that we do this, and want to see their loved one shared with the world too.\n\nThought leadership can also be the muse and catalyst for new innovation. When you\u2019re organized by a core set of beliefs, you\u2019re always thinking 'What more could we do?'\"\n\nFive strategies to becoming a thought leader:\n\n#1 Find your Fire\n\nAs I mentioned before, strong thought leadership is rooted in authenticity, so you need to figure out what lights a fire in your belly! What topics could you give an impassioned speech about? For me, it\u2019s helpful to think about what injustices I want to fix in the world \u2014 that gets me fired up.\n\n#2 Journal About It\n\nOriginality of thought is the other cornerstone to effective thought leadership, so it\u2019s important to stop and reflect on what you really think about a given topic. To be an effective thought leader on end of life, I had to develop my own relationship with and beliefs around death, so I write!\n\n#3 Talk to Your Customers\n\nSome of the best wisdom comes from conversations with your customers and/or audience. By deeply understanding their context and their world and their context, it helps you see the bigger picture of how your product fits into it.\n\n#4 Become an Observer\n\nA lot of original thought leadership comes from observation \u2014 particularly of how things are changing. By paying attention to shifts in culture, societal roles, and values, you can start to make better predictions of what the future will look like. Pay closer attention to how the world is changing around you.\n\n#5 Infuse Emotion\n\nAt the heart of great thought leadership is great emotional energy. You feel energized, inspired, a sense of wonder. If you can figure out how to emotionally move someone with your new ideas and beliefs, your thought leadership will be all the more effective.", "author": ["Yitzi Weiner"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/SrSCR72BSBs/349046", "published": "2020-04-16T18:00:00", "title": "Have You 'Immunized' Your Franchise Portfolio Against the Coronavirus?", "text": "April 16, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThere\u2019s no polite way to put this: The coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis is going to cause a lot of franchise owners who aren\u2019t properly diversified to take it in the teeth.\n\nLike other tough times before it \u2014 from 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina to the 2008 financial meltdown \u2014 the current COVID-19 pandemic, which shows no signs of immediately letting up, has reinforced the importance of franchise diversification.\n\nDiversification is a smart move for any kind of portfolio or investment. You wouldn\u2019t want your retirement savings to be entirely in stocks \u2014 you\u2019d want it spread across a mix of cash, bonds, stocks and other assets. The idea is that a downturn in one category is offset by steady performance or gains in the other categories.\n\nNot being diversified means exposure to more risk and considerably more financial pain when things go south, as they inevitably do from time to time. Given this troublesome fact of life, the franchise owners who will best be able to withstand the economic havoc from the coronavirus crisis are those who are properly diversified.\n\nAnyone who is thinking of getting into the franchising business needs to understand this important lesson.\n\nDoing franchise diversification right\n\nDiversification doesn\u2019t just mean owning more than one unit of a particular franchise. That\u2019s certainly helpful, but it\u2019s a one-dimensional approach. True diversification comes by approaching your franchise portfolio from multiple angles and employing a multi-dimensional strategy.\n\nRelated: Check Out the 2020 Franchise 500 Ranking\n\nGeographical diversification, of course, is key, especially in light of the varying degrees of lockdown that different towns, states and countries are experiencing right now. For example, franchisees with units in Texas, which was relatively quick to lock down, might have been looking longingly across the border at Oklahoma, where bars and restaurants stayed open for several weeks longer.\n\nAnd while no one knows exactly how the recovery from COVID-19 will unfold, it\u2019s likely some regions or states will open up before others do.\n\nLikewise, franchisees with a blend of concepts and offerings in their portfolio are better positioned to ride out this storm. Having a mix of casual dining, quick-serve and fast-food restaurants, for instance, can provide some lift when your fine-dining options take a hit due to unforeseen economic circumstances.\n\nAt an even more granular level, having a drive-through or a to-go component in the mix can help hedge your risk \u2014 especially when the business landscape changes virtually overnight and people want to limit in-person transactions.\n\nOther important considerations\n\nFranchise owners should also look at operational diversification. Put another way: How easy is it to run the operation? A steak and seafood restaurant requires a lot of different SKUs, chefs and waitstaff to properly operate. A coffee place, by contrast, only needs a few essential supplies and a couple of key people to keep the cash register ringing. Each of these configurations has a different profitability profile depending on wider economic considerations.\n\nSpeaking of supplies: how diversified are you in that dimension? If you own a sandwich shop, a pizza place and a donut shop, and there\u2019s suddenly a global shortage of flour, you\u2019re going to be hurting. If your franchise mix includes some smoothie bars and barbeque joints, the pain will be diluted.\n\nRelated: 300 Franchises to Open With Nearly Any Budget in 2020\n\nLast but not least, look at the margins. Do some of your operations have razor-thin margins? If so, balance it out with franchises that have some wiggle room for rent and labor and cost of goods, and can more easily adjust to a financial shock. The bottom line? You want a mix of margins across your franchise portfolio.\n\nEven with proper diversification that takes these different factors into account, the next few months of the coronavirus crisis are going to be rough. So, what steps should franchise owners be taking right now to make it through to the other side?\n\nFor starters, if you don\u2019t already have an SBA-approved lender, find one ASAP and make him or her your best friend. When the Small Business Administration starts handing out loans \u2014many of them forgivable if used to keep your employees working \u2014 you want to be first in line.\n\nThen, focus on doing what you need to do to stay afloat. If you\u2019re able to hold on to your people and keep paying them, that\u2019s fantastic \u2013\u2014 but that can\u2019t continue indefinitely if there\u2019s not enough revenue coming through the door.\n\nLayoffs might be necessary, but will hopefully be temporary.

Start with sound money practices, structures and tools. For example, think about how you\u2019ll keep track of your information like contacts, accounting, etc. Will you maintain databases on your own or shop out the function to a CPA or financial firm? Either way, be sure to create a system to document all orders received, including dates received/paid, with full documentation of payment information. If you do it yourself, you can use a simple, homemade version (like an Excel spreadsheet) initially, but there are also many computer programs and online services like QuickBooks for order and payment management available.\n\nSet up money and tax-management systems that work for you. One way to do this is to create a money map of how money will come in and out of your new enterprise. Show your financial advisor (CPA firm) your money map. They can translate that into something called a chart of accounts, which codifies all the ways you earn and spend money.\n\nHere are a few more tips for setting up systems that will help you keep track of your funds and ensure that you pay your fair share to Uncle Sam:\n\nOpen a business-specific checking account. Apply for a busi\u00adness-specific credit card. NEVER mingle personal and business funds. Always keep a wall between them.\n\nSet up quarterly tax payment schedules. Check with your attorney and financial advisor for advice specific to your circumstances.\n\nDetermine, with your advisors, if you need to collect sales taxes on the goods or services you provide.\n\nRequest your Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) from the IRS. Even one-person busi\u00adnesses need this. There\u2019s no charge. You can apply online.\n\nRemember: Smart money management practices aren\u2019t only important to the health and wealth of your business, but also to create peace of mind.

Given this, managers of privately held companies trying to attract and retain top-tier talent are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs. Most of these companies aren\u2019t offsetting the amount of cash they spend on compensation by creating meaningful equity programs \u2014 this is how they can change that.\n\nTech startups have for long known that paying equity is crucial to attracting top-tier talent. Startup owners typically give up about 7 percent equity to initial employees before any large rounds of financing and 54 percent equity to investors and employees by the time they reach Series A funding, according to an analysis of over 10,000 cap tables of VC-backed companies by Morgan Stanley\u2019s Shareworks.\n\nRelated: The Pros and Cons of Working for Equity\n\nAnalysis from Institutional Shareholder Services shows that equity is also important in how a public company compensates its top-tier employees. Public company CEOs, for example, earn 68 percent of their compensation in equity and options. Only 10 percent of their compensation is in the form of salary and bonuses.\n\nBut just rolling out an equity program does not solve the problem for privately held companies. Candidates receive most of the value from company equity when they sell their shares. And since privately held companies don\u2019t trade on public markets, candidates can often only sell their shares if the company owner sells the business. When I started thinking about rolling out an employee equity program last year, that meant I had to ask myself a tough question: When do I anticipate exiting my business? After a lot of soul searching, I realized the honest answer was I don\u2019t know.\n\nMost candidates will not place any value in the equity received if they anticipate the company remaining private over the long haul. This made me look into how privately held companies with no intention of going public create equity programs that can attract and retain top-tier talent. The first piece of advice I received was to follow the example of consulting and law firms. A number of them have set up a model where newly elected partners at the firm receive or buy equity even if the firms never go public.\n\nRelated: How to Retain Millennial Employees Through Workplace Equity\n\nHowever, I discovered that \u201cequity\u201d meant very different things to these firms. In some firms, the partners don\u2019t receive any actual ownership in the company. Instead, they get to invest money in a bank account and receive 20-plus percent interest rates on that money. In other firms, the partners receive so-called phantom stocks, which are designed to act like equity by increasing in value as the company does and paying dividends but don't provide the same legal rights as co-owning a company. Many of these partnerships also only allow partners to sell their shares back to the company when they exit the firm, and at pre-determined valuations that are not connected with the true value of the company.\n\nTo me, these restrictions would have defeated the purpose of offering equity in the first place. After all, I wanted my star performers to feel like owners in the company. By its name alone phantom equity indicates it\u2019s not a real equity program. And modern employees want equity because they not only want to be part of growing something but also getting a piece of the value they\u2019ve created. An extra bonus check once a year and then selling back their shares for pretty much the same price as they received them doesn't cut it.\n\nRelated: What you Need to Know About Stock Options as a Startup Employee\n\nLuckily, my firm places executives with public, VC-backed, private equity owned and privately held companies. I had observed more than 100 equity plans over the years and had seen a number of creative equity structures.\n\nAfter all my research, I decided to model my program after one used by a family investment office focused on acquiring small- and medium-sized businesses. It competes with privaty equity firms for talent, which is where the candidate I placed used to work. Unlike private equity firms, however, many family investment offices buy companies with a long investment horizon, sometimes holding the companies over multiple generations. And most family offices don\u2019t have any intentions of selling their own investment office or going public. This family office was no different, and it created a problem for the talent it wanted to attract. Because there was no clear exit from the firms it owned, there would be no clear payout events either. The candidate I placed wanted to know they had liquidity in the equity they owned even if they didn't plan to leave.\n\nDespite these restrictions, this family office offers candidates real restricted stock units (RSUs) \u2013 not phantom stocks. And it also gives employees the right, but not obligation, to sell back their equity to the firm every two or so years. This gives the candidates even better liquidity than many VC-backed companies where employees are locked in to holding their equity until the company goes public. The value of the RSUs can either be determined by an external valuation firm, set by the management team or tied to a pre-determined formula based on the company\u2019s revenues, profits or other metrics.\n\nRelated: What Should I Know About My Stock Options?\n\nSkeptics of this model often ask if this creates incentives for the company to hold future valuations artificially low so they don\u2019t have to buy back the equity at a high price. However, this is not quite true. If the company wants to keep attracting future talent and retain the talent that has received equity, it's incentivized to make the price for every equity buyback fair and attractive.\n\nThe more I researched the topic, the more I discovered that there are endless ways for privately held companies to design equity plans. Many of the designs offer the owners of the company strong protection, leaving the employees with the short end of the stick if something goes wrong. As nervous as I was to give up real ownership in my firm for the first time, I realized that if I truly wanted to attract and retain candidates who would be excited by the value of the equity they received, it was in my best interest to make the program fair for both parties.\n\nCash is king during tumultuous times.

You will always find people who are helping.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo wrote Fred Rogers, aka Mr. Rogers, back in 2002. And true enough, in the midst of the pandemic, I didn't have to look far to find a helper. Jerry Orans is a 16-year-old high school sophomore in my home community of Mamaroneck, NY, who is more than just helping: He is leading a movement of makers to get hospital workers the PPE they so desperately need.\n\nWe spoke on the phone about his passion project, Hack the Pandemic, and how you can help support this incredible grassroots effort to equip the first responders.\n\nDan Bova: What gave you the idea to do this?\n\nJerry Orans: I've been reading for a while about how all of these hospitals in the New York area don't have enough PPE or personal protective equipment to safely treat their patients, while also keeping other patients and the hospital staff safe. So I thought, well, that's not good! Then I realized that there are all these people at home in quarantine who have 3-D printers that aren't necessarily using them for anything. And there are all of these people who can sew and aren't necessarily sewing anything. So I was like, Hey, why don't we have them start making medical supplies? So I started on March 23rd and since then we've got over a hundred active makers and three global distribution partners.\n\nThat's incredible. How did you find the plans for the equipment?\n\nThe original that really helped me click with the idea was a 3-D printing company called Prusa3D. They made the original 3-D printable face shield design, and from there we've iterated and worked on a design that allows for faster printing. The original prototype from Prusa was actually approved by the Czech Ministry of Health and the FDA has validated that the design.\n\nRelated: 3 Simple Steps to Start Your Side Hustle in This Crisis\n\nDid you imagine this idea would catch on as quickly as it has?\n\nMy original idea was to reach out to robotics teams. Our school, Mamaroneck High School, has one and there are 50-something robotics teams in Westchester County \u2014 none of whom are doing anything right now because the season was canceled. So things started to trickle in that way, and pretty soon it took off.\n\nHow did you go about getting the word out?\n\nI set up a website and a Twitter page and tagged a couple of my friends as well as Prusa3D and Masks for Docs, which was the original company that was doing the distribution side of it.\n\nAnd then it really took off when I got in touch with the Larchmont-Mamaroneck STEM Alliance, which is our local nonprofit, and they were able to use their giant email marketing to get the word out and invite people to help and brainstorm. And now we are set up to accept tax-free donations through the STEM Alliance. I did some interviews with places like our local public access TV station LMCTV and other news outlets, but I have no marketing budget.\n\nHow many masks and shields have you been able to make with your network?\n\nWe have created about 500 shields, 20-plus intubation boxes, 1,000 Ear savers, and have an order in the works for 20,000 reusable face shields. Our main problem is that home machines are not built to operate at high-speeds around the clock, and that is why we are looking to find corporate partners who have machines and materials that they aren\u2019t using to join us.

Bly\u2019s The Content Marketing Handbook. Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble\n\nDesign plays an important role in the success of your content. Long before they read your words, readers will begin judging the value of your content by its appearance.\n\nHere, according to desktop design guru Roger C. Parker, are 10 of the most common graphic design mistakes and how to avoid them:\n\n1. Overuse of Color\n\nThe overuse of color does a disservice to readers who print white papers on inkjet printers. Avoid solid-colored backgrounds behind the text. Such pages can cost several dollars each in ink supplies. In addition, bright colors can create distractions that make adjacent text hard to read. Finally, text set in color is often harder to read than black text against a plain white background.\n\n2. Missing Page Numbers\n\nMany white papers lack page numbers. But readers depend on page numbers to track their progress through a publication. They also rely on page numbers to refer back to previously read information.\n\n3. Long Lines of Type\n\nMany white papers are hard to read because the text extends in an unbroken line across the page, from the left-hand margin to the right-hand margin. But long lines of type are difficult and tiresome to read. In addition, the resulting left and right margins are very narrow. White space along the edges of pages provides a resting spot for readers\u2019 eyes and emphasizes the adjacent text.\n\n4. Inappropriate Typeface\n\nThere are three main classifications of font: decorative, serif, and sans serif.\n\nDecorative fonts like Constantia or Broadway are heavily stylized and great for attracting attention or projecting an atmosphere or image. The use of these typefaces should be restricted to logos and packag\u00ading, however, where image is more important than readability. Serif fonts like Times New Roman and Garamond are ideal for extended reading. The serifs, or finishing strokes at the edges of each character, help define the unique shape of each letter and lead the reader\u2019s eyes from letter to letter. Sans serif fonts like Arial and Verdana are very legible. Their clean, simple design helps readers recognize words from a long distance away, which is why they are used for highway signage. Sans serif typefaces are often used for headlines and subheads combined with serif body copy.\n\n5. Wrong Type Size\n\nWhen type is set too large, at 14 points, for instance, you can\u2019t fit enough words on each line for readers to comfortably skim the text. Conversely, the details that help readers identify each character become lost when type is set too small. Type set too small also requires too many left-to-right eye movements on each line, which causes eye strain over time. The most popular and readable type size is 12 points.\n\n6. Difficult-to-Read Headlines\n\nHeadlines should form a strong contrast with the text they introduce. Readers should have no trouble locating or reading them. And never set headlines entirely in all capital letters\u2014it makes them harder to read than headlines set in a combination of uppercase and lowercase type.\n\n7. Failure to Chunk Content\n\nChunking refers to making text easier to read by breaking it into manageable, bite-size pieces. The best way to chunk content is to insert frequent subheads throughout the text. Subheads convert skimmers into readers by \u201cadvertising\u201d the text that follows. Each subhead thus provides an entry point into the text. They also avoid the visual boredom created by page after page of nearly identical paragraphs.\n\n8. Poor Subhead Formatting\n\nTo work, subheads must form a strong visual contrast with the text. It\u2019s not enough to simply italicize the subhead text. They should be noticeably larger and/or bolder than the adjacent body copy. Never underline subheads to \u201cmake them more notice\u00adable.\u201d Underlining makes them harder to read because it interferes with the descenders\u2014the portions of lowercase letters like g, p, and y that extend below the invisible line the subheads rest on. Also, limit subheads to a few key words, and avoid using full sentences. Subheads work best when limited to a single line.\n\n9. Distracting Headers, Footers, and Borders\n\nHeaders and footers refer to text or graphic accents repeated at the top or bottom of each page. Page numbers, copyright information, and the publisher\u2019s address should be smaller and less noticeable than the main text. Large, colored logos on each page can also be very distracting, without adding meaningful information.\n\nAs for borders, pages are often boxed, with lines of equal thickness at the top, bottom, and sides. Boxed pages project a conservative, old-fashioned look. A more contemporary image can be created using rules, or lines, of different thickness at just the top and bottom of each page.\n\n10. Widows and Orphans\n\nWidows and orphans occur when a word, a portion of a word, or a partial line of text is isolated at the bottom of a page or column (an orphan) or at the top of the next page or column (a widow). The worst-case scenario occurs when a subhead appears by itself at the bottom of a page, isolated from the paragraph it introduces, which appears at the top of the next page. Some software allows you to automatically \u201clock\u201d subheads to the text they introduce\u2014make sure you use this feature.\n\nWhen someone downloads a white paper from you, within seconds they will either feel a glow of pleasure or a sense of disappointment. Readers check out the cover and glance at the text, and then either say, \u201cAw, just another hard-to-read, look-alike white paper\u201d or \u201cWow! This looks really great!\u201d Whether your white paper receives the attention it deserves and paves the way for future sales or (worst-case scenario) is instantly deleted or round-filed depends to a great extent on its design.", "author": ["Robert W.

Offer a 30 Percent Discount.", "text": "April 14, 2020 4 min read\n\nIf you\u2019re going to advertise during the COVID-19 pandemic, offer a discount \u2014 or better yet, offer something for free.\n\nThat\u2019s the big takeaway from a survey of 5,531 consumers, produced by the Canadian product review site Chick Advisor. The company interviewed people about the kinds of advertising they do and don\u2019t want to see right now.\n\nThis is an important subject, because many entrepreneurs are unsure of how to communicate during this crisis. Is it OK to advertise, they wonder? Is it OK to send cold pitches? The answer: Yes, so long as you\u2019re catering to people\u2019s needs, and speaking to them from a place of understanding. \u201cRight now,\u201d says business consultant Adam Bornstein, \u201cthe idea of a stranger reaching out and saying, \u2018I thought you could use this\u2019 is one of the kindest things that you could do.\u201d\n\nSo what do consumers want, and what are they thinking about when they see advertising today? Here\u2019s what the survey found.\n\n1. Give them what they want \u2026 but lower the price.\n\nIf you can drop your price or even give something away for free, you have people\u2019s attention.\n\nThe results were very clear about this: 84 percent of people said they want to see ads for free product sampling, and 58 percent said they like to see discounts for products they already like. Consider where these people are coming from: Many of them have been laid off or had their salaries reduced \u2014 in fact, 84 percent of them said they\u2019re concerned about their finances \u2014 so they\u2019re looking for ways to buy things they enjoy without straining their budgets.\n\n2. The magic discount number is 30 percent.\n\nThe survey asked people: \u201cWhat is the minimum discount you\u2019d need to convince you to shop?\u201d\n\nThe answer: Almost nobody wanted a 10 percent discount, a handful of people were fine with a 15 percent discount, and nearly a quarter of people were compelled by a 20 percent discount. But the big winner was a 30 percent discount \u2014 with nearly half of all respondents saying that the number would convince them to shop.\n\n3. People really love free shipping.\n\n\u201cIf a brand you liked offered you an incentive to shop their online store for items you enjoy but aren\u2019t necessities,\u201d the survey asked, \u201cwhich incentive would you need to see in order to make the purchase?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how people ranked the incentives, from most to least desired:\n\nFree shipping with no (or very low) minimum spend Flat discount on entire purchase High-value gift with purchase \u201cSpend more, save more\u201d (with a higher discount for bigger purchases)\n\n4. Now\u2019s a good time to get consumer feedback.\n\nLots of people have time to spare, and they\u2019re willing to give you some of it: Seventy-nine percent of people said they\u2019d be happy to fill out a brand\u2019s online survey so long as they have the time. In fact, you might even get overwhelmed with responses. A few weeks ago, Seamless sent out an invitation to fill out its survey in exchange for a $5 Amazon gift card, and the response was so strong that many people couldn\u2019t access the survey.\n\nLittle incentives like that $5 card might drive more responses, but it isn\u2019t actually necessary, according to the Chick Advisor survey. Only 12 percent of people said they needed an incentive in order to give their feedback.\n\n5. Reach people where they are.\n\nIn the survey, most people said they don\u2019t mind seeing advertising on television, online, in social media or on radio. So if that\u2019s where you were reaching consumers before, it\u2019s a good place to continue.\n\nOne big potential change: If you weren\u2019t producing videos, now's the time to start. Of people surveyed, 60 percent said that they don\u2019t mind seeing video tutorials or other video content that tells a brand\u2019s story.", "author": ["Jason Feifer"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/poB4Kc0LXOA/348223", "published": "2020-04-14T19:00:00", "title": "3 Ways to Build and Grow a Successful Business in 2020", "text": "April 14, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nShanda Sumpter is the founder and CEO of HeartCore Business, a training company that gives entrepreneurs step-by-step systems to help them build successful businesses.

We\u2019re so consumed with our posts and who commented or liked it, we\u2019ve moved into wanting to be famous rather than being successful. Build your business by focusing on warm traffic: referred traffic, affiliate traffic and by building something called \u2018buyers lists,\u2019 which you can get from others in your niche. And while I love social media, remember: You\u2019re at a huge disadvantage when your focus is on social first. Many entrepreneurs who come to me have these huge platforms, but they\u2019re not making serious money. That\u2019s why you build your business first. It\u2019s better to be successful than famous.\"\n\n3. Control your business by controlling a sales department.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t outsource sales,\u201d Sumpter urges. \u201cEverybody wants to focus on marketing and being popular, and they forgot about the conversion part about being profitable. One of the things we\u2019ve done right at HeartCore is to build our own call center. People always ask me where we find such great salespeople, and I tell them: from our clients and our email lists. What better place to find salespeople than from those that already have successful relationships and connections with you?

Subscribe \u00bb\n\nBurger King had a big announcement to make: It was removing artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives from its Whoppers. But the company was in a bind. The other burger chain had already, how shall we say, McDone the same thing. If Burger King simply ran ads pushing its fresh food, that wouldn\u2019t have much impact. At worst, it would be seen as trailing its competitor.\n\nWhat could it do to steer the conversation? Burger King\u2019s marketing team started confabbing on WhatsApp, their chat tool of choice, where some of their most creative brainstorming takes place. That\u2019s where they pulled in three agencies and worked out a plan. You likely saw the result: On February 19, Burger King released ads of its famous burger, now liberated from additives, rotting over 34 days \u2014 growing fuzzy and putrid with greenish, purplish mold, eventually slumping into itself (see ad further down).\n\nStomachs everywhere lurched. That day, Twitter mentions of Burger King more than tripled, and a week later, they were still up 22 percent over the previous seven days, according to social media analytics company Sprout Social, which crunched the data for Entrepreneur. The press went crazy, too, with coverage in Forbes, CNN, People, and The New York Times. As it turns out, nothing cuts through the fast-food noise like mold.\n\nRelated: 10 Secrets to Going Viral on Social Media\n\nBut this was just another day at Burger King HQ in Miami. The brand has become known for pushing out-there marketing campaigns that hijack the culture\u2019s fleeting attention span and, as a result, boost business long-term. And now the same live-wire marketing is coming out of Popeyes, which, like Burger King, is owned by RBI, a fast-food parent company with $5.6 billion in revenues last year.\n\nThe secret sauce? A Brazilian soccer nut named Fernando Machado.\n\nMachado, 45, is RBI\u2019s global CMO. Since landing at Burger King in 2014, he has overseen 50 to 60 marketing campaigns a year that consistently have the right mix of timing, self-\u00addeprecating humor, and stun power. While he\u2019s been busy racking up marketing awards (Adweek\u2019s Grand Brand Genius in 2018 and the Cannes Lions Creative Brand of the Year in 2019, among them), the chain\u2019s average annual system-wide sales growth has increased to 9.28 percent, compared with 5.56 percent over the three years before his tenure.\n\nBut it\u2019s been a long road. Born in Rio de Janeiro, Machado grew up with no interest in marketing. In fact, he\u2019d never even heard of it. At the age of 19, he was pursuing a mechanical engineering degree and, to gain experience, took a job at a Brazilian factory where he designed laundry detergent boxes for Unilever. But when a marketing team from one of the brands arrived, he was wowed. \u201cIt was really cool because the guys were handling the business, but they also had a creative side to their work,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI thought maybe I\u2019d do better there, and I definitely would have more fun.\u201d\n\nUnilever eventually hired him for a marketing role, where he rose through the ranks and created many memorable projects. He became VP for Dove Skin Care during its \u201cCampaign for Real Beauty\u201d \u2014 a marketing effort that spanned more than a decade, celebrating people of all different body types and looks. It was a daunting task to add to the brand\u2019s work so far, but Machado managed to bring to life a brilliant concept: A forensic artist drew the faces of several women \u2014 first according to how they each described themselves to him, and then as a stranger did. The sessions were packaged into ads in 2013, which carried the tagline \u201cYou\u2019re more beautiful than you think.\u201d\n\nRelated: How to Plan a Viral Marketing Campaign\n\nMachado had made a name for himself by then, but this campaign defined him as a game changer. And yet, later that year, he felt restless. He\u2019d been at Unilever for 18 years by then. \u201cFor the first time in my career, I was not itching to do the next thing,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was afraid of being stuck in my comfort zone.\u201d He wanted a bigger challenge \u2014 to help shape a powerful brand that had become adrift. Burger King fit the bill at the time. After calling a few people he knew there, he joined as head of brand marketing.\n\nWhen he moved to Miami at the beginning of 2014, Machado knew exactly zero about the quick-service food industry. So he started reaching out to franchisees. \u201cYou can learn a lot from these guys,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are there in the battlefield every day looking in the eyes of the guests.\u201d He wanted to understand things like what makes burgers sell, and who the end customer is. And as he grew into his role, he kept doing it. Today, he takes a lot of formal meetings but also routinely messages franchisees and restaurant managers on LinkedIn, where he can learn about what trends and shifts they\u2019re seeing in the stores.\n\nHe also set about building his creative team. Machado is exacting and proactive about this; he says he looks for people with \u201cthe same level of creative ambition\u201d as him, and if he spots talent, he reaches out. When he was at Unilever, he met a young guy from a creative firm and quickly pulled him into his office to discuss a project; now that guy, Marcelo Pascoa, is Burger King\u2019s head of marketing. In another case, Machado was already at RBI when he became impressed with an agency in Spain and tweeted the creative director saying he loved their work. He suggested they apply to do a local Burger King project. Now that guy, Pancho Cassis, is CCO of David The Agency, the brand\u2019s leading outside firm.\n\nMachado treats his creative team as if they\u2019re in a nonstop jam session. Aside from messaging them on WhatsApp, he inhales Twitter 24-7. (\u201cIf you ask my wife,\u201d says Machado, the father of a 5-year-old and an infant, \u201cshe would throw my phone into the pool.\u201d) He also takes the jam offline. He has a standing soccer game on Thursdays against a couple of partners at Gut, the external ad agency he now uses for Popeyes. (\u201cI hardly ever win,\u201d he confesses.) He also hosts regular barbecues for the crew at David The Agency. And in the office, he still likes to keep it real. Despite being a corporate C-suiter, he\u2019s always wearing a Burger King crew shirt. \u201cI thought he was going to wear it to get married,\u201d says Cassis. \u201cHe didn\u2019t. But it was the joke of the wedding.\u201d\n\nNone of this is by accident. Machado puts the time into carefully assembling and maintaining his team for good reason: He knows he has to trust them. Because to him, good marketing has to feel risky \u2014 and to stay on top of culture, you have to make decisions fast.\n\nImage Credit: Courtesy of Alison Brod Marketing + Communications\n\nMachado asks his team for a lot of ideas, and he\u2019ll say no to most of them. But everything goes through the same mental filters. \u201cThe first thing I think about is whether it has a good brand fit,\u201d he says. \u201cDoes it fit with the values and the personality of the brand? Does it fit with the history of the brand? Does it fit with the brand position?\u201d Then he asks if the idea meets the company\u2019s strategic objectives \u2014 because sure, it\u2019s a bummer to kill a great concept, but Machado looks at it this way: When his work does drive strategic business objectives, \u201cI\u2019ll get more funding and I\u2019ll get more people to invest and I\u2019ll get more support,\u201d he says. And that means more great work.\n\nThen, finally, he wonders: Will people talk about this? That\u2019s crucial, because his budgets aren\u2019t as large as some of his competitors\u2019. So where he can\u2019t win on paid media, he goes for human attention. \u201cI need ideas that will have legs and that people will share on social and that will get organic media coverage,\u201d he says.\n\nHere\u2019s how all that famously played out in 2017.\n\n\u201cI will never forget this,\u201d says Machado. He got a call from two guys at David The Agency asking him to come over. \u201cI was like, \u2018Really? I\u2019m in a bad mood. Do you really want me to come?\u2019 \u201d Juan Javier Pe\u00f1a Plaza and Ricardo Casal, who made the call and since have gone on to become partners at Gut, promised to cheer him up. So Machado went.\n\nThey showed him a concept: In a 15-second television ad, a Burger King crew member would say, \u201cOK, Google, what is the Whopper burger?\u201d If that ad was playing in a room that had a Google Home, it would trigger the device to start robo-reading the Whopper\u2019s Wikipedia entry. It was a clever, if not slightly annoying, way to poke fun at the rise of home voice-assistant devices.\n\nRelated: Getting Mentioned by a Media Site Isn't Enough to Go Viral. You Need to Do This, Too.\n\nMachado loved it. When it came out in April 2017, Google quickly blocked its smart device from answering the voice of the actor. Machado lobbed back by dubbing the ad with different voices. \u201cWe really wanted to have fun,\u201d he says, much to the apparent amusement of many. According to internal data, the campaign got 9.3 billion impressions and $135 million in earned media.\n\nOther times, Machado needs a lot more convincing. Casal and Pe\u00f1a Plaza once presented an idea about the repeal of net neutrality, which was in the news at the time. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018What the hell is that?\u2019 \u201d says Machado. \u201cI had no idea what net neutrality was.\u201d The duo explained it \u2014 twice \u2014 and then sketched out their concept of using Whoppers to help people understand what losing democratic access to the internet would mean.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s never going to work,\u201d Machado said.\n\n\u201cNo, no, it is,\u201d both Casal and Pe\u00f1a Plaza promised.\n\nMachado wasn\u2019t convinced. (\u201cHe hated the idea, like, really hated it,\u201d recalls Casal.) Despite that, he gave them the money to go ahead and produce the ad \u2014 because the point of hiring risk-taking talent is that sometimes they know things you don\u2019t. The spot they made showed customers grabbing their Whoppers while others are told they have to wait or pay as much as $25.99 for faster access. They released it in January 2018, and it became the most shared ad in Burger King history.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the moments,\u201d says Casal, \u201cwhen we looked at each other and understood how much we trust in each other. There have also been times where we\u2019re telling him, \u2018No, man. This will not work.\u2019 And we ended up trying it \u2014 and it worked because he\u2019s also a creative. And no one knows the brand better than him.\u201d\n\nAs Machado has gotten more daring at Burger King, he has discovered another important reason to push crazy ideas: Sometimes it can reveal even more business opportunities.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened at the end of 2018. Burger King wanted people to download its new mobile app. Many competitors had one, so the product itself wasn\u2019t new. Maybe Burger King could give out a free Whopper to anyone who downloaded it? Nah. \u201cWe did that. Chick-fil-A did that, Wendy\u2019s did that, McDonald\u2019s did that,\u201d Machado says. \u201cNo one ever heard about any of it because people honestly don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 5 Characteristics of Social Media Websites That Go Viral\n\nHis team came up with an insane scheme: Customers could get a Whopper for a penny on the app\u2026but only if they ordered it while within 600 feet of a McDonald\u2019s. Yes. They had to go to Burger King\u2019s archrival to get the deal. \u201cWe know that our fans love a good joke,\u201d says Machado. \u201cAnd they love the idea of being part of that joke.\u201d To pull it off, Machado orchestrated the geofencing of not only their own 7,000-plus U.S. restaurants but all the 14,000 McDonald\u2019s locations across the country.\n\nThe campaign got more than 1.5 million people to download the Burger King mobile app during the nine days of the promotion, which was a 37.5 percent increase. That should translate into customers spending an additional $15 million per year, the company estimates \u2014 making the ROI for the campaign about 37 to 1. \u201cIt was massive,\u201d says Machado. \u201cAnd we built intelligence with the geofencing that helps us today. Because I know when people are going to a McDonald\u2019s, I know when people are going to a Burger King. Sometimes doing these technology moonshots can help you develop capabilities you haven\u2019t even thought about before.\u201d\n\nHow does Machado come up with ideas? It\u2019s a question he gets asked a lot. Oftentimes, he says, they come from active collaborations. \u201cBut I also have a good ability of putting a problem, or something I have to think about, somewhere on my mind \u2014 like processing that information all the time, even when I\u2019m not thinking about it actively,\u201d he says. And then great solutions pop up at random when he\u2019s driving, playing soccer, or changing diapers.\n\nBut sometimes there\u2019s no time for all that. Decisions have to be made fast.\n\nThat\u2019s how Machado\u2019s team made its biggest splash of 2019, after his job had expanded to also overseeing marketing for Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. Anyone on Twitter will remember what happened: With a single tweet, Popeyes kicked off a fried-chicken-sandwich war that led to lines stretching outside stores across the country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went down. The chain launched its new chicken sandwich. A week later, at 11:15 a.m. on August 19, a Popeyes marketer noticed that Chick-fil-A had tweeted a subtle putdown of the sandwich. He immediately alerted the wider team by WhatsApp \u2014 a group that included 20-something people, including Machado, the ad agency Gut, the social media agency GSD&M, and legal. Bruno Cardinali, Popeyes\u2019 head of marketing for North America, gathered people on the fifth floor of the company\u2019s Miami office to think of a retort. Fifteen minutes later, thanks to GSD&M, they had it.\n\n\u201cY\u2019all good?\u201d Popeyes tweeted back to Chick-fil-A.\n\nAnd all hell broke loose.\n\nRelated: The Best Social Media Marketing Tips for Your Specialty Food Business\n\n\u201cBlack Twitter jumped behind this one and propelled it to a level of conversation that, honestly, I have never seen anything like in my career,\u201d says Machado. \u201cIt was everywhere. There were restaurants that got fined because the line was so long it was disturbing other places in the region. There was a teenager who decided to register people to vote for the election because there were so many people waiting \u2014 Obama tweeted about that.\u201d\n\nPopeyes sold out of chicken sandwiches in eight days. It made international headlines. The brand\u2019s sales growth soared that quarter \u2014 42.3 percent, compared with 6.3 percent for the previous year. And it hasn\u2019t stopped. Already this year, Popeyes captured headlines by selling its uniforms as a trendy fashion look after fans noticed an amusing similarity to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hot Ivy Park collection. Machado was thrilled, but it all happened by design. This, after all, is the result of the foundation he has laid: a risk-taking team that\u2019s always on, and a laser focus on ideas that drive business.\n\nIt\u2019s an addictive game, he says, and now he\u2019ll be doing even more of it \u2014 because he\u2019ll also be overseeing RBI\u2019s third brand, Tim Hortons. \u201cWhen an idea hits and you see everyone talking about it and the message you wanted to convey is coming across, it\u2019s a massive high to the entire team,\u201d says Machado. \u201cWe are always chasing that feeling.\u201d", "author": ["Liz Brody"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/6FcOsptT7gU/349122", "published": "2020-04-13T18:32:00", "title": "Why You Should Consider Contribution Marketing Right Now", "text": "April 13, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIf you are not in businesses such as pharmaceuticals, grocery store supply chains or psychotherapy, you\u2019re probably wondering how you\u2019re supposed to market your business in the time of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nAs a business consultant, I asked myself that very question.

Contribution marketing means offering a product or service that fills an immediate need.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the only type of marketing you should be focusing on right now. Why? Because building brand equity and goodwill is going to come back to you in spades. It\u2019s called karma.\n\nIf you\u2019re a brick-and-mortar business like a fitness studio, it means offering your services online. If you\u2019re a home education platform, it means offering a sampling of your courses for free or at deeply discounted prices. If you\u2019re a fashion business, perhaps you take off the restocking fees since no one can come to the store to try on clothes at the moment.\n\nAnd don\u2019t cheat by offering the same discounts and services that you normally do. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary marketing efforts. Your contribution marketing needs to be completely new and unprecedented.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen some small and large businesses engage in successful contribution marketing. For example, Loom, which offers video-recording software, removed its limits on file staring because it saw so many people were using it to communicate with their virtual teams. T-Mobile launched T-Mobile Connect, its lowest-priced smartphone plan ever, and educational software companies like Scholastic have opened up much of their platform free of charge.\n\nRelated: 4 Strategies to Help Your Business Recover From Coronavirus\n\nIs contribution marketing right for you?\n\nTo find out if contribution marketing is the best path for your business, ask yourself a few questions:\n\nDo you offer something that fills an immediate public need?\n\nHow can you contribute your time, money and effort in a constructive way?\n\nWhere can you offer support?\n\nIn some cases, you may not have an answer. If you\u2019re a travel company, for example, this just might not be your time to market discounts on summer vacations. That\u2019s fine. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t tend to your business in other ways.\n\nJust put a freeze on your marketing efforts for now. Don\u2019t expend any energy on it.\n\nInstead, buckle down and take care of your business from the inside. Get your taxes in early this year (despite the extended due date), organize that paperwork that you always avoid, sit with your team and start doing workflows. Take a little break. Let your business be quiet. Gear up for your next launch. My point is: If you've got nothing contributing to say, don't say it.\n\nWhat not to do\n\nDespite all the uncertainty and pressures all around you, do not respond to this crisis from a place of fear. Deep discounts and fire sales are not the answer.\n\nNeither is preying on other people's fears by just sticking the words \u201cCOVID-19\u201d or \u201ccoronavirus\u201d on your latest campaign even though it\u2019s completely unrelated. That\u2019s clickbaiting, and it\u2019s not only insensitive \u2014 it\u2019s terrible for business.\n\nWhat\u2019s good for business? Contribution marketing. It's not about saving money. It's about how can you help people in real, tangible ways. And if you are wondering what the ROI is, you\u2019re not thinking about it correctly. You are providing a service to the world. Even from a practical business standpoint, you're building goodwill and gaining free exposure.\n\nDo you know what it would cost you to get the kind of viral publicity some people are getting now because of their free access offering? Remember these changes are temporary. This too shall pass. But right now the world is what it is, and your marketing needs to reflect that.\n\nRelated: 8 Books to Help You Grow During the Coronavirus Pandemic", "author": ["Estie Rand"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/6cdLzORjZCY/345927", "published": "2020-04-13T17:00:00", "title": "A Quick Guide to Protecting the Name of Your Business", "text": "April 13, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe following excerpt is from Brad Flowers\u2019s The Naming Book. Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | IndieBound\n\nIf you\u2019ve chosen your business name, congratulations! What\u2019s the next step? How do you formalize your name so you can start to work?\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll need to register your name with the state in which you\u2019ll do business. But first, let\u2019s clarify some vocabulary before moving on. Fair warning: What follows wades into some legal lingo. I\u2019m not a lawyer. This should be taken as general information and guideposts, not legal advice. I recommend seeking the guidance of a lawyer throughout the process.\n\nCopyright or Trademark\n\nThese two protections function similarly, in the sense that they both protect your intellectual property. They work a little differently, though. You\u2019ll likely generate copyrightable material through the course of your business. If you write a book or a blog post, create a course, or design an image, those things can all be copyrighted. But your business name (or the title of your book, for that matter) cannot be.\n\nFor the protection of business names, we must look to trademarks. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) defines a trademark in this way: \u201cA trademark is a brand name. A trademark or service mark includes any word, name, symbol, device, or any combination, used or intended to be used to identify and distinguish the goods/services of one seller or provider from those of others, and to indicate the source of the goods/services.\u201d That gets us to the next distinction.\n\nTrademark or Service Mark\n\nThe details here are a little in the weeds, but they might be important to you. A trademark protects companies selling a product. Nike and Budweiser are trademarks. A service mark protects a company providing a service. The store where you buy your Nike shoes or the bar where you buy your Budweiser beer will likely have a service mark. They\u2019re providing you the service of selling you the product.\n\nYou\u2019ve undoubtedly seen organizations use the \u00ae symbol after their brand name. That\u2019s for use once the USPTO has officially registered your trademark or service mark. While you\u2019re waiting for that approval, you can use TM or SM to indicate that you intend to register.\n\nTo Trademark or Not to Trademark\n\nThat is the question. If you decide to trademark, you\u2019re obligated to defend it. That will cost you both time and money (most often by hiring a lawyer). And yes, that time and money will be well-spent. There are famous cases of companies failing to enforce their trademarks and losing them. Here are a few examples:\n\nEscalator : Originally trademarked by the Otis Elevator Co. in 1900. Lost in 1950.\n\n: Originally trademarked by the Otis Elevator Co. in 1900. Lost in 1950. Yo-yo : Trademarked in 1932. Thirty-three years later, a court ruled the trademark had been improperly registered.\n\n: Trademarked in 1932. Thirty-three years later, a court ruled the trademark had been improperly registered. Zipper: Registered in 1925. Five years later, people were using the word so widely it had become a generic term, and the com\u00adpany lost the trademark.\n\nIn general, it\u2019s a good idea to pursue a trademark. There are some competitive markets where trademarking is absolutely essential. If you know you want to trademark, or think you might, consult a trademark attorney.\n\nYou can also submit the name for trademark approval online. In order for the name to be registrable, the USPTO is looking for two things. One, the mark has to be unique. It can\u2019t be spelled or pronounced the same as another registered trademark. If it\u2019s similar to other trademarks, it goes to the next criterion: Is the similarly named company selling related goods or services?\n\n\u201cRelated\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean exactly the same. A consumer often buys milk and yogurt from the same company, for example. So, if your company makes yogurt, a milk manufacturer with a similar name would be considered related.\n\nThe USPTO offers some guidance on what qualities make for a strong name that\u2019s more likely to be accepted. It has four categories to consider.\n\nThe first two are unregistrable:\n\nGeneric. This would be like starting a bicycle company and trying to register the brand name Bicycle. Descriptive. This would be trying to register a name that explic\u00aditly describes the product, like Lightweight Bicycles.\n\nThe third and fourth categories are stronger and can be registered:", "author": ["Brad Flowers"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/hYAywkuPYj0/348775", "published": "2020-04-13T16:00:00", "title": "10 Top Instagram Tools to Stand Out During Quarantine", "text": "April 13, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThere are two strategies you can pursue right now: 1. Retreat and play defense with all the uncertainty surrounding the economy and world, or 2. Go on the offense, control your brand\u2019s narrative and push more content. Personally, I\u2019m choosing the offense. Increasing my social media posting and driving my brand forward is in my control, unlike a lot of other variables (like where my next stash of TP is going to come from).\n\nWith COVID-19 keeping much of the country on lockdown, this is shaping up to be a year of Instagram-consumer overload, opening an opportunity for content creators and entrepreneurs to start engaging with their base a little more. I\u2019ve been seeing lots of users hack out new ideas, especially on Instagram Live. This experience, while tragic and traumatic in many ways, has also doubled as a litmus test for brands and their social media strategy.\n\nAs a chance to start reassessing the Instagram tools you might be using and what can be improved, I\u2019ve decided to pull together a set of 10 \u2014 each of which I\u2019m currently using across my various businesses and brands \u2014 that can help you start planning and assessing how to grow your followers during this otherwise challenging period.\n\nRelated: Quarantined? Boost Your Social Proof With These 5 Strategies\n\nViralRace\n\nAn excellent choice if you want to build your follower base quickly, ViralRace enables you to get your content in front of the people who would enjoy it most. The system allows people to send their profiles out to a wide group of people, and thousands of interested users then follow the account. The app is a custom AI engine that geo targets followers to get quality leads, which is what was compelling to me as a user. I\u2019ll note that since it\u2019s not utilizing a bot or fake followers from a farm, the build is quick, but built with genuine people that will stick with you. When you consider how often Instagram sweeps to get rid of fake followers and bots, a tool like ViralRace is an efficient, affordable way to garner more traction for the long haul, which I highly recommend to get a solid base going.\n\nFigma\n\nOne of the most intuitive and inventive design tools to come out recently, Figma is giving Adobe a run for its money (especially since Figma starts its pricing out as free, versus Adobe, which only offers free trials). Beyond the pricing, Figma is a seamless collaborative-design platform that works in real time with your team on projects. It's especially helpful if you\u2019re working with a copywriter/graphic designer duo or have multiple hands on your Instagram\u2019s design scheme. It\u2019s not often I come across products that provide effective collaboration, and I always stick with them when I do.\n\nLater\n\nFrom the team that brought you LinkInBio (a grid-formatted link for linking out content on Instagram posts), Later is one of my favorite products for planning and scheduling out your content for Instagram. Later has a clean and easy UI and delivers on analytics that are easy to understand. With competitive pricing that starts at free for individuals, Later is something you definitely shouldn\u2019t put a hold on checking out.\n\nVSCO\n\nConsidered by many to be one of the strongest visual communities out there, VSCO is where you need to go for any and all visual inspiration. As VSCO\u2019s primary tool is their photo editor, they\u2019ve had some skin in the game since Instagram\u2019s early days, growing to be one of the biggest treasure troves of different styles and shots from some of the world\u2019s best. Consistently going strong for almost a decade now, VSCO is a classic for any Instagram pro\u2019s social-media arsenal.\n\nUnion Metrics\n\nAn alternative-analytics platform from Later, Union Metrics has a robust platform for tracking who\u2019s been looking at your Instagram and which of your content they\u2019ve been gravitating toward. Explaining data in a pretty straightforward way, Union Metrics can help you quite a bit in making informed decisions on what type of content you should be posting, as well as what time is the most advantageous.\n\nBuzzSumo\n\nFor all the talk about influencer-marketing campaigns, the best of them start with BuzzSumo. Giving you a deep dive into what each influencer\u2019s follower count is like, average engagement and ranking for your Instagram, its platform helps quite a bit in getting the best ROI out of your influencer-marketing campaigns. Although a little pricier in that it\u2019s designed for professional teams, it\u2019s still a smart consideration if you\u2019re really looking to ramp up your influencer marketing soon.\n\nTikTok\n\nWhy use TikTok, an Instagram competitor, as a tool for engaging on Instagram? The content format and editing are increasingly becoming the new norm in people\u2019s Instagram Stories. More and more people are turning to TikTok to create short videos with a narrative (similar to a longer Vine), evolving a new medium of content that didn\u2019t exist before. Even if your Instagram still has good engagement on its Stories, learning how to create content \"TikTok style\" will help you stay ahead of the curve while also enabling you to start building an audience on another platform.\n\nRelated: Facebook and Instagram to Limit Coronavirus Misinformation\n\nLinktree\n\nFor a simple, linear tool to help organize, compile and track personal links, Linktree is the best in the business. Starting with unlimited links in its free version, it\u2019s a perfect solution for anyone trying to collect their clickables in one place. Plus, in the advanced version, the tracking is especially helpful in the content you\u2019re trying to A/B test your engagement on. I personally love the data and make changes based on what I see. For example, if one of my articles is getting more clicks, I put it higher on my Linktree feed.\n\nLandscape\n\nA new tool introduced by SproutSocial, Landscape helps you resize any and all your photos into a convenient size for Instagram. Although many of us think cropping things down is an easy job, you\u2019d be surprised how much content people prohibit themselves from capturing because they don\u2019t think it\u2019ll fit for Instagram, or they\u2019ve taken a flick and it doesn\u2019t fit. Instead, Landscape fixes that problem, changing behavior in helping more people create content freely. Plus, its quick click-and-drag system is one of the simplest, most convenient ways to get the job done better and faster than going through manually.\n\nAR Filters\n\nFinally, a trend that doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down is AR filters, which enable people to do everything from taking quizzes to wear masks and even play games. The possibilities creators have been exploring with AR filters have been endless, cycling through with new interactive and engaging content almost every week.

And with the latest forecasts predicting a 20 percent rise in social ad spending (up to $4.3 billion) in 2020, you also can\u2019t afford to make mistakes on your social ad strategy. Just because everyone is jumping on the opportunity to advertise socially doesn\u2019t mean it should be done hastily. First, acquaint yourself with strategies that will ensure your ad spend is successful.\n\nOne of the best ways to make sure your strategy is sound is to know what not to do. The following are the most common mistakes that companies make with their social ad strategy. Avoid them and you'll see the ROI you\u2019re looking for.\n\n1. Investing the bulk of the ad spend upfront without audience testing\n\nOnce a company has decided to invest in social ads, they usually create their audience targeting based on what they already know about their consumers. They may have data about age range, geographical location, gender and interests. But even if they've done extensive market research, audience testing is still imperative for social ads. Many companies believe they already know how to target their audience for the highest ROI, and invest the bulk of their ad spend budget upfront, hungry for quick results.\n\nThankfully, Facebook makes finding your ideal audience easy with a split testing feature that enables you to split test up to five advertisements at once. If you\u2019re building ads on Twitter, TikTok or Pinterest and can\u2019t use a split test feature, start a small test budget on an educated guess, then adjust accordingly. Keep the ad consistent, but change key factors in the audience and see what happens.\n\n2. Loss of sales and potential customers from negative ad comments\n\nSocial ads, especially backed by a large ad spend, are exposed to thousands, if not millions of people and are therefore also exposed to chances for negative comments. It could be a disgruntled former client or someone who just doesn\u2019t like your ad, but negative comments do lead to a loss of sales.\n\nThink about it: if you saw an ad for a product you were potentially interested in and a comment on the ad said that the product didn\u2019t work or that they had a horrible experience, you likely wouldn\u2019t follow that first instinct to purchase.\n\nJoseph Lazukin, founder of Facebook ad campaign manager Pixelsmarter, explained that one of the common ways companies seek to fix this is by hiring a virtual assistant. \u201cEven with a virtual assistant watching for them, there's human error,\u201d Lazukin says. \u201cMissing negative comments is a costly mistake, and it should ideally be managed by software.\u201d\n\n3. Not having a clear call to action\n\nFinally, the ultimate goal of a social ad is to spur action. This won\u2019t be easily done if it\u2019s unclear to the viewer how to take action. Simply educating them that your product or service exists might lead them to click on your link, but be crystal clear on what you want them to do. Is it buy? Subscribe to your newsletter? Follow your account?\n\nGlobal Web Index reported that 13 percent of social media users say that a \u201cbuy\u201d button increases their likelihood of buying something they see in a social ad. It\u2019s about making the call to action as easy as possible for your target consumer \u2014 that one easy button saves them the trouble of searching for your website online, and the ease of purchasing guides them through the sales cycle on the impulse your ad initiated. Don\u2019t make it more complicated than it needs to be.\n\nAlthough these are three of the most common mistakes, others can include changing brand feel and strategy frequently, forgetting strong visuals and bold language and not making tweaks as the initial performance data comes in. Make sure to assign someone on your team to manage ads: They can be a full-time job, but they also have a significant ROI.", "author": ["Imran Tariq"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/z_SWy2Iwu0w/348725", "published": "2020-04-09T18:30:00", "title": "\"Can I Send Cold Pitches During Coronavirus?\"", "text": "April 9, 2020 3 min read\n\nIf you\u2019re an entrepreneur who gets clients through cold pitches, you might wonder: Is it still OK to pitch at a time like this?\n\nThe answer: Yes, but you need to think differently about your offering and your approach.\n\nTo dig into the details, I arranged a coaching session between an entrepreneur and an industry expert\u2014and filmed it so you can watch.\n\nDwaynia Wilkerson runs the content writing company Prose and Pens; she gets most of her clients through cold pitches, but is nervous about pitching now. Adam Bornstein, an Entrepreneur magazine columnist and cofounder of Pen Name Consulting, gave Wilkerson some ways to rethink her approach.\n\nThree major takeaways:\n\n1. Think of your pitch as a service, not just a way to get business\n\nConsider what your potential clients are going through right now. They\u2019re scrambling, they\u2019re concerned about their business, and yet they\u2019re trying to step up and serve their own audiences as best they can. They could use some help\u2014and that\u2019s your opening. Do a deep dive on their business before making contact, getting to know what they do, what they could use help on, and how you can create a customized solution.\n\n\u201cRight now,\u201d Bornstein says, \u201cthe idea of a stranger reaching out and saying, \u2018I thought you could use this\u2019, is one of the kindest things that you could do.\u201d\n\n2. Offer discounts now, and win long-term business for later\n\nEveryone is scared, and budgets are tight. When you reach out to people, acknowledge the hardship and offer to help. \u201cYou have to get into the mode of giving a little bit more because we are at a time where people might not be able to give back,\u201d Bornstein says.\n\nFor example, can you offer discounted services? Can you go above and beyond to meet their needs? If so, you\u2019ll be appreciated for a very long time\u2014and that\u2019ll pay off later. \u201cBusiness is always built on the long game,\u201d Bornstein says. \u201cIf you really want your business to survive, it's a matter of cultivating relationships in the here and now.\u201d\n\n3. A/B test your cold pitches\n\nIn times like this, you want to get the messaging exactly right. What does that look like? You won\u2019t know until you try\u2014so Bornstein suggests creating a system to test your outreach. Write three different versions of your pitch, then send each version to about five leads. Track what happens, and then adjust based on the results.\n\nThis may sound weird and impersonal, but Bornstein encourages you to try it anyway. \u201cIt's built on the idea of science itself,\u201d he says. \u201cScience is a matter of asking questions, getting an answer, and coming up with new questions. Is there a risk in doing it? Yes, but there's also a risk in not doing it. Not knowing is the greatest threat to any business.\u201d\n\nFor more advice, watch the video above!", "author": ["Jason Feifer"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/yqjsTdY6fBE/345905", "published": "2020-04-08T17:50:00", "title": "8 Steps to Webinar Success", "text": "April 8, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe following excerpt is from Robert W. Bly\u2019s The Content Marketing Handbook. Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble\n\nPut up a webinar registration page. Drive traffic to the registration page with an email invitation. Hold the webinar. Make a special offer at the close of the webinar. Follow up with emails reminding attendees and registrants of the special offer.\n\nWebinars have long been an effective content marketing tactic. Your prospects can hear you talk and see your slides right on their com\u00adputer screens. A typical sales funnel for a content marketing campaign incorporating a free webinar is:\n\nThe biggest problem with webinars is that more and more companies are producing them. That means the web is getting cluttered with them, making it more difficult to get attention for your event. Build your visual webinar presentation like a high-quality sales letter, including all the elements that lead to closing a sale.\n\nPlan sales follow-up early. Too often you\u2019ll see a lot of work and money wasted on a great webinar or teleseminar because leads aren\u2019t followed up quickly. Don\u2019t make this mistake; it\u2019s better to over-prepare for follow-up by automating as much as possible and run reports to inspect the process and track results. After all, the key webinar metric is most often the sales attributed to the event.\n\nHere are eight more methods that can improve your webinars:\n\n1. Use a Topic That Attracts Attendees\n\nWhich topic will likely pull in more attendees: a) \u201cHow to Buy Our Product Now\u201d or b) \u201cMaking Your Business Life Easier Through New Strategies\u201d? If you said b) because it promises a benefit, you\u2019re right.\n\nIf you test different topics, you\u2019ll find that promising an interesting, timely, and educational webinar will pull best. Your presentation should be \u201csolution-oriented,\u201d so give participants practical ways to solve their problems. This topic should, of course, tie in with the real goal of your presentation: education, lead generation, or product launching.\n\n2. Research to Target the Right People\n\nIt would be impractical of me to market a teleseminar on \u201cbreaking into the ebook writing business\u201d to people who were already successful ebook authors. I\u2019d need to search out forums, chat rooms, mail groups, or ezine lists that cater to the beginning ebook writer. Once you find a topic of interest, create a sales follow-up plan, and then build your event marketing plan from there.\n\n3. Temper Your Attendance Expectations\n\nYou should expect a show rate of roughly 30 percent of those registered for a free webinar.\n\nIf your numbers are significantly below that, make sure you\u2019re doing day-of and 24-hour reminders via email. Invite more prospects to your event and invite them multiple times.\n\n4. Use Polling Questions\n\nMost leading webinar platforms allow you to pre-load interactive polling questions into a presentation. You can capture attendee-specific data that may help you tailor this webinar as well as the next one. Ask things like:\n\nWhat interests you most about this webinar?\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest challenge today?\n\nWhere are you in the buying process?\n\nWould you like more information on our new technology?\n\n5. Craft to Reach Specific Needs\n\nYou can craft a webinar to meet any content need, such as:\n\nEducational marketing events\n\nList- or database-building events\n\nOne-to-many sales pitches\n\nThought-leadership events\n\nClient training\n\nSurveys\n\nUpsell or resell events\n\nThank you or loyalty events\n\nFor example, consider holding database-building webinars to restock the top of your sales funnel. Other webinars help educate your prospects and clients over time, which in turn helps you achieve your marketing, sales, and organizational objectives over the long run.\n\nChoose your technology with your overall goal in mind. You\u2019ll want a reliable web conferencing solution that is compatible with a variety of operating systems. It should be scalable to the size of your audience and have the features you are looking for: polling, Q&A, and recording. My favorite is Webex.\n\n6. Focus on Live Events First\n\nThere are many reasons for this, including the use of polling questions, the chance to answer live questions, and the immediacy and excitement created for participants by a live event.\n\nYou can always use a recording of a presentation-only webinar as a sales tool on your website, but the live events truly create relationships and quickly build your business.\n\n7. Inspire and Motivate Prospects\n\nHave your attendees try, buy, or contact you for more information. Also consider a limited-time offer for webinar attendees to add extra incentive and urgency to your call to action. This can be a simple but effective way of getting more results from your webinars. If you\u2019re doing an educational webinar followed by a sales presentation, tell them to stay on for \u201cmore information on how they can put the information presented into action with [your product or service].\u201d\n\n8. Speak with Energy\n\nBe enthusiastic. Your exuberance and friendly personality can inspire and motivate your participants. Engage them in conversation and make them feel comfortable enough to ask questions, if you\u2019ve enabled the chat or Q&A features. Have fun with your presentations!", "author": ["Robert W.

For newcomers to the digital marketing scene, it can be challenging to establish authority right off the bat with so much competition in the space unless there\u2019s something about your product or service that has a clear competitive advantage.\n\nIt comes down to finding a particular marketing niche, and this has to be a bit more specific than \u201cstartups.\u201d Serve a very specific type of company, and take extra care of your clients to prove your investment in that niche. If you\u2019re looking to build up this type of specialized authority, the following four steps will get you there.\n\n1. Research which industries are booming.\n\nFirst, when choosing a niche, it\u2019s important to make sure it\u2019s in an industry that\u2019s doing well at the moment. Some niches may look attractive because there are very few other marketing agencies in the space, but that may also mean that the businesses or potential clients in that niche don\u2019t have extra money to spend on digital marketing services, or they don\u2019t need the services. To begin to determine which industries are booming, look at the stock market and press coverage to get a sense for what\u2019s happening economically. Stocks will be on the rise and the press is likely to point out which industries are worth watching this year.\n\nStill, while that's a good place to start, and a good way to familiarize yourself with the market prospects, it\u2019s also a good idea to get out and talk to people at networking events and in business unions. Everyone will rush to the industries that are being talked about most, or that seem to be doing well in the investment space. Go beyond this. Speaking with other entrepreneurs and private investors may help you get a sense for industries that are doing well, but aren\u2019t yet populated by other niche marketers. Once you find a niche you feel good about, go all in on it.\n\nRelated: 5 Digital Marketing Tips for the Legal Niche From a Lawyer\n\n2. Give your full focus to clients in your chosen niche.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your niche, it\u2019s critical to stick with it. When you meet potential clients outside the niche who want to hire you, it may be tempting, but working with clients outside your niche will dilute your ability to establish authority in that specialized area. They will distract you from other clients who can build a firm foundation for your authority. You must decide whether the income or the authority means more to you. But when making that calculation, you should also consider how building a strong foundation of expertise can pay off financially down the line.\n\nUse a virtual assistant or work on your own to scrape online email addresses and phone numbers for every business, then begin your sales calls. To narrow your niche even further, start with businesses in a certain state or metropolitan area. Let them know that your sole focus is their type of business, which will stand out to them, especially if they are a very specialized business (think: landscaping, or daycares). They won\u2019t be used to services that are solely focused on their type of business.\n\nRelated: Marketing Dos and Don'ts During a Crisis\n\n3. Go above and beyond.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve signed on one client, seek to impress in the value that you offer. If you create a monthly newsletter, for example, packed with marketing tips that could attract new clients, you can also use the platform to promote current clients. Get creative with how you offer more value than most: Doing more than clients expect can lead to referrals and word of mouth. This not only brings in more clients but helps you establish more authority. The value could simply be in your business model and what you offer to the client in your services.\n\n4. The proof is in the pudding.\n\nFinally, as you continue to build up your list of clients, diligently track data on what you\u2019ve done for them. It\u2019s not enough to say that you\u2019re the authority in one niche; show it with testimonials, numbers and figures. Make sure that they\u2019re as specific as possible. Rather than having testimonials that simply say, \u201cTheir service is great!\u201d, ask for clients to give details on what the service did for them. This information shared in an unbiased way from past customers carries a lot of credibility and weight.\n\nThen, use this proof as much as you can. Include it on your website and in your press kit, and when you land press, give these specific markers of authority to validate any mention of you as a leader in your niche. Continue to prove the ways that you\u2019re an authority in a given industry.\n\nOne of the best parts of establishing authority in one niche is that, when you finally build enough credibility, you can scale and expand to other related niches. Your credibility from one will carry to the other, but only if you double down on building authority in the first.\n\nRelated: 9 Sales and Marketing Tips for Startups", "author": ["Aimee Tariq"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/P1GpG55qwSs/348843", "published": "2020-04-08T12:00:00", "title": "Could You Be Doing Better With Email Marketing?

No more than a start in the right direction", "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - In what now seems like a galaxy far, far away, Republican lawmakers routinely talked up the idea of raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. In fact, we were in that galaxy just three years ago.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Participants hold signs as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks at a news conference to introduce the \"Medicare for All Act of 2019\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 10, 2019. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo\n\nA higher Medicare age was an awful policy idea when the Republican-controlled House of Representatives pitched it in 2017 (reut.rs/3cjvT01). It was just as bad in various proposals from Paul Ryan to reform federal spending when he ran the House Budget Committee and served as speaker of the House. And just imagine what it could have meant during today's coronavirus outbreak, which disproportionately affects older adults who rely on Medicare.\n\nThe pandemic has made the yawning gaps and inequities in our health insurance system painfully obvious. And until now, the dream of universal health insurance coverage has seemed very distant.\n\nBut last week, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden became the first major-party candidate to call to expand access to Medicare by reducing the eligibility age to 60. This is a remarkable turning point - the standard bearer of a major party actually is calling for significant expansion of a government program. \u201cSuddenly, the government doesn\u2019t seem to be such a bad actor anymore,\u201d said Marilyn Moon, one of the nation\u2019s top experts on Medicare.\n\nMoon is an economist and former public trustee of both Medicare and Social Security. She co-chaired a recent study on ways to expand Medicare eligibility by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI).\n\nBiden\u2019s proposal was a concession to the progressive wing of his party aimed at unity for the fall election, and it was a step in the right direction. But the NASI report shows that dropping the Medicare age to 60 would be no more than a very incremental step. A new battle over health reform surely will emerge in the wake of the pandemic, and the outcome we need is universal, affordable health coverage for all that improves the quality of care.\n\nTHREE APPROACHES TO REFORM\n\nThe NASI study bit.ly/2K4Aya7 offers a fascinating in-depth look at three approaches to expanding Medicare eligibility: lowering the eligibility age, establishing Medicare for All, and creating a Medicare buy-in. The report was created by a study panel made up of 27 experts from a broad range of perspectives, such as economics, health policy, political science, sociology, medicine and law.\n\nThe report draws some surprising conclusions about the practicality of actually executing these approaches. Yes, Medicare for All might be the toughest putt from a political standpoint - but the optional buy-in - which sounded great rolling off the tongues of moderate candidates like Pete Buttigieg - actually is the most difficult to execute.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think that Medicare for All sounds nice, but that it is aspirational and very difficult, if not impossible to do in practice,\u201d said Moon. \u201cAnd the buy-in just sounds like it\u2019s not a big change. But we quickly realized that the buy-in was very complicated, because you take a complicated program like Medicare, which has a lot of moving parts, and then the even more complex Affordable Care Act structure and you try to marry the two in some way. It\u2019s very difficult to do.\u201d\n\nMedicare for All could achieve nearly universal coverage, and yield sizable administrative savings. But there are plenty of questions about how exactly it would be executed. These include the continued role - if any - of private insurance like Medicare Advantage, Medigap and prescription drug plans; benefits and cost sharing and financing mechanisms, to name just a few. From a political standpoint, a push for Medicare for All would provoke a donnybrook with the powerful health insurance lobby if it includes an end of commercial health insurance as we know it.\n\nA SWEET SPOT?\n\nReducing the Medicare age might just be the sweet spot, because it is fairly straightforward to implement and might not provoke the same intensity of political opposition.\n\nBut if we want to make a meaningful difference in healthcare coverage in this country, the age would need to move much lower than 60. The NASI study found that an entry point of age 62 would add 10.1 million to the Medicare rolls, but only 670,000 who had been uninsured because this older age group already has a comparatively low uninsured rate. Of course, that figure could be much higher now due to COVID-19-induced job losses.\n\nDropping the eligibility age to 50 would add 57.3 million new enrollees, 4.6 million of whom would have been uninsured. But that would come with its own set of questions. \u201cYou begin to change the nature of the people that are being covered, including many more families with children - but Medicare is an individually based insurance program,\u201d said Moon. \u201cYou also have to figure out whether or not the payment rates that Medicare uses that help make it inexpensive would be adequate for healthcare providers who suddenly would be covering many more of their patients under Medicare.\u201d\n\nA lower Medicare age would come with a few other complications, starting with how to finance the expansion. Medicare Part B (outpatient services) and Part D (prescription drugs) are paid for with a combination of enrollee premiums and government general revenue. But Part A (hospitalization) is financed through a payroll tax paid in advance by workers. The fund's actuarial assumptions are premised on serving only the 65-and-older population, and it already is on thin ice, facing an exhaustion date of 2026. (reut.rs/2RBxUwP) That date will likely move even closer due to the unanticipated cost of\n\ncaring for coronavirus patients.\n\nBiden has proposed to protect the Part A trust fund by financing the expense of serving new, younger enrollees from general revenue, rather than the payroll tax.\n\nIt is far too early in the pandemic crisis to know where this debate will go, and much will depend on the political makeup of Washington next year. But as the saying goes, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste nyti.ms/2ykhKkl.\n\nFor more on Medicare expansion, check out my podcast interview this week with Marilyn Moon bit.ly/3adkttp.\n\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)", "author": ["Mark Miller", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/ysXTsplob60/your-questions-on-the-lockdown-and-u-s-small-business-answered-idUSKCN21X3HA", "published": "2020-04-15T23:16:36", "title": "Your questions on the lockdown and U.S. small business, answered", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - After closing their doors to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, many small businesses face an uncertain future following government-ordered lockdowns.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A closed sign is shown on the window of a beach sports store during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Encinitas, California, U.S., April 9, 2020.

To cut red tape, have all documents in order.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants\n\nWhat should small businesses do in the meantime if they are strapped for cash?\n\n\u201cFirst, know that you\u2019re not alone and not a failure. If you can, cut costs and get creative as much as possible. Sell gift cards, go online, do what you can. Ask your landlord if they can give a reprieve.

Hopefully, I will not have to do this for too many months. If so, I may need to re-evaluate my decision,\u201d Pauly said.\n\nMany small business owners are in a similar situation, where even an influx of relief cash will not help them stay afloat. The dilemma they face is whether to seek aid or close up, often by going bankrupt.\n\nSince small businesses often are tied into the lives of their owners, personal finances are on the line, too. Many owners mix personal and business expenses on their credit cards and use a house or other personal assets as collateral.\n\nWhile there are plenty of ways for owners to forestall catastrophe, like negotiating rent or mortgage delays, some businesses just do not have the cash flow to keep things going.\n\n\u201cBusiness bankruptcies go hand-in-hand with personal bankruptcy,\u201d said Carl Peterson, vice president of small firms at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\n\nThe first step is to do the math, and that will mean an immediate call to your accountant, if you have one. Ask: \u201cWhat is my revenue drop? What will it be in the next three to six months? What will my fixed costs be? What deferments can I get?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you have to figure out if that gap is going to be too large to recover from,\u201d said Ian Weinberg, a certified financial planner in Woodbury, New York.\n\nWeinberg noted that for now programs like the Paycheck Protection Program cover just a few months of payroll.

For instance, a restaurateur with a loan coming due in May will have trouble refinancing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important who owns the liability on your obligations,\u201d Bishop said, noting that if you have personally guaranteed the rent or a loan, your own finances will be dragged down, too.\n\nThis is the stage to bring in a business attorney, to sort out either how to ramp down the business legally, or go into bankruptcy.\n\nIf you are a one-person shop, you \u201ccan go away with minimal effort,\u201d said Kashif Ahmed, a certified financial planner in Bedford, Massachusetts. One of Ahmed\u2019s clients put his business in hibernation for now.\n\nIf you have employees or other obligations like a lease, insurance or inventory, then it gets more complicated.\n\nAnyone with a business structure like an LLC or an S Corporation needs a lawyer to do the proper filing to cease business operations, said Simon Hughes, a business attorney in Houston. Otherwise, you risk being sued by creditors, and you also risk your future business prospects.\n\nLitigation is what brings bankruptcy to a head. \u201cIf there is potentially going to be a big judgment against the entity, then bankruptcy is the only way to put a stop to it,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nOtherwise, you may be able to negotiate a settlement with creditors, because they realize that it is better to recover something like 70% of what is owed than risk what they will get from a judge.\n\nIf your business is so small that you do not have an accountant and a business lawyer on tap, there are resources available from the Small Business Association, said AICPA\u2019s Peterson.\n\nServices like Rocket Lawyer provide bankruptcy worksheets for free (here), but this is not a very do-it-yourself pursuit.\n\n\u201cWhile business owners are legally permitted to represent themselves from start to finish, that doesn\u2019t mean being their own bankruptcy lawyer is a good idea,\u201d said Charley Moore, an attorney and founder and CEO of Rocket Lawyer.", "author": ["Beth Pinsker", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/Sf4mMiBhZlk/your-money-freelancers-have-perfect-storm-of-anxiety-because-of-covid-19-idUSKBN21O22K", "published": "2020-04-09T15:33:40", "title": "Your Money: Freelancers have 'perfect storm' of anxiety because of COVID-19", "text": "NEW YORK(Reuters) - The crisis posed by COVID-19 is worrisome enough for full-time employees.

Your healthcare is expensive, or you may not even be able to afford it \u2013 which makes you even more terrified of the coronavirus.\n\nWhat amplifies the impact is that so much of society consists of independent workers and contractors.

But here are some thoughts that might help:\n\n* Put guardrails around your financial life.\n\nAfter being suicidal because of the anxiety of having a big tax bill, Kinsman put systems in place so her financial life would not spiral out of control again. She autopays as many bills as she can, automates her savings, gets receipts sent to her email and takes pictures of deductible expenses to store in her phone. That way, very little is left to choice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all muscle memory at this point,\u201d Kinsman said.\n\n* Take the help.\n\nThere are multiple levels of state, federal, local and corporate response to the crisis, so take advantage of those before depleting emergency savings.\n\nThe federal stimulus also makes a special pathway for gig workers to receive unemployment benefits based on recent earnings, plus four months\u2019 of additional payments of up to $600 a week.\n\nIt's administered through state unemployment assistance programs, so research local requirements (bit.ly/3aNBFGJ).\n\n* Buttress gig work with steadier part-time employment.\n\nSara Benincasa, a Los Angeles resident who is a comedian, actress, TV writer and author of \u201cReal Artists Have Day Jobs,\u201d suggests balancing gig work with something part-time but more stable, as she does in the digital marketing sector. That can hook you into positive elements like affordable health plans and help cover for slow months when independent gigs dry up. (The interview was conducted before the U.S. COVID-19 shutdown.)\n\n* Research mental health resources.\n\nSince most freelancers do not have the cash or coverage for pricey therapy sessions, look for low-cost or no-cost mental health services, Benincasa advises.\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness is one key resource (http://nami.org). You can also lean on faith communities, recovery groups and a growing number of apps like Talkspace, which can help make therapy more accessible and affordable.\n\nKinsman is a fan of Crisis Text Line (www.crisistextline.org/), which provides free, 24/7 support via text message.\n\n* Know you are not alone.\n\nWhen so much of the workforce is freelance, you are most definitely not by yourself in taking a financial and emotional hit in today\u2019s crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, and we all know it\u2019s bad,\u201d said Kinsman, now an editor at Food & Wine magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s really scary to talk about these issues - but knowing you\u2019re not alone is the most freeing and incredible thing.\u201d\n\n(This story was refiled to clarify the timing of interview in the 16th paragraph.)", "author": ["Chris Taylor", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/C-RNRx39kiQ/vix-futures-point-to-coronavirus-worries-for-months-to-come-idUSKCN21Q2ZS", "published": "2020-04-08T18:49:05", "title": "VIX futures point to coronavirus worries for months to come", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are betting on stocks to remain volatile well into the year, suggesting that many expect the long-term economic and public health impact of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus to continue roiling markets despite a recent rally.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The final numbers of the day are displayed above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

Between 20 and 50 percent of retailers, meanwhile, are paying their full April rent, with mall-based retailers the least likely to be able to pay in full, he said.\n\nCrowe is skeptical that REIT values will recover any time soon and remains focused on segments such as cell phone towers and industrial warehouses.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing some stocks get a nice technical bounce right now, but we aren\u2019t playing the stock market,\u201d he said.\n\nConsumers are likely to remain skeptical of spending time in enclosed spaces even after the economy reopens, which will put a cloud over hotels, restaurants and movie theaters and keep a lid on job growth for the next several years, Crowe said.

GoFundMe said it has strict procedures for vetting campaigns, but there are so many other avenues that people are using.\n\nThe safest way to give is through your credit card, rather than cash, debit or texting, Silverstone said. Also, never click through to links from emails or social media but go directly to the sites where you want to give and donate through a secure platform.\n\nAnd know this key fact when giving: The IRS does not call.

Governor Andrew Cuomo on Thursday pegged revenue losses due to the health crisis at $10 billion in fiscal 2021, which began on April 1.\n\nSome other states have also reduced their revenue projections for the current and next fiscal years. Michigan is eyeing a loss of $1 billion to $3 billion for fiscal 2020, which ends on Sept. 30, and $1 billion to $4 billion for fiscal 2021, according to the state treasurer\u2019s office.\n\nTotal state taxes grew by 7.6% in February compared with the same month in 2019, according to Lucy Dadayan, senior research associate at the Urban Institute, based on reporting from 45 states. March tax collections from a handful of early reporting states show no major revenue drop so far, indicating April revenue reports may provide a fuller picture of the hit to state budgets.\n\nRichard Ciccarone, president of Merritt Research Services, which provides data on muni credits, said investors will undertake a \u201csorting-out process\u201d to gauge which issuers and areas of the country are financially at risk.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s regions that are not hurt may be tomorrow\u2019s worst case,\u201d he cautioned.\n\nHe added that so-called credit spreads for some issuers will widen significantly.\n\nSpreads for bonds issued by Illinois, the lowest-rated state at a notch or two above junk due to its chronic structural budget deficit and huge unfunded pension liability, have done just that.

Wait times could be long for a customer service agent if you cannot figure out how to do it electronically. You also may have already missed the window for April, depending on your billing date.\n\nWageWorks advises that normal refund policies are still in place. If your pass does not expire, just hold on to it for now, the company said (here).\n\n*Gym memberships\n\nMany national fitness chains have Covid-19 information pages available online, although messaging varies.\n\nSome, like LA Fitness, immediately paused all billing and waived all freeze fees. Members inadvertently billed during the freeze will get their membership time extended, said Jill Greuling, president of club operations for the chain.\n\nOthers have evolved. 24 Hour Fitness said in a statement that it closed gyms on March 16, and effective April 16, it will suspend all membership billings, if the clubs are not open by then. Anyone billed for closed days from March 17 through April 15 will \u201creceive additional days of club access\u201d added on to the end of their membership.\n\nGym memberships are notoriously hard to cancel.\n\n\u201cSome you have to come in person to cancel, and bring a form,\u201d noted Adam Dell, head of digital product management for Marcus by Goldman Sachs and founder of Clarity Money. So for now, you might want to accept the freeze.\n\nBeware of simply cancelling the automatic payment through your credit card. Because you are under a contract, the gym could send your account to collections, and that could damage your credit score.\n\n*Summer programs\n\nLike many summer programs, Camp High Rocks in Brevard, North Carolina, moved back its \u201cpay in full\u201d date, which parents often set up to autobill to credit cards.\n\nPayments that had been due in April are now postponed - with some camps extending the due dates to June.

REUTERS/Baz Ratner/File Photo\n\nScientists on Thursday described the results of a comprehensive study of this behavior - unique in the animal kingdom - that is exhibited by these primates native to Madagascar.\n\nMale ring-tailed lemurs increase their attractiveness to females by secreting from glands on their wrists a fruity and floral aroma smelling similar to a pear, the researchers said.\n\nThe behavior dubbed \u201cstink flirting\u201d involves a male rubbing a fragrant clear liquid that oozes from those glands against his long fluffy tail and then waving the tail at females. The researchers pinpointed three compounds responsible for the scent.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that the key odorants were not really stinky,\u201d said University of Tokyo biochemistry professor Kazushige Touhara, who led the study published in the journal Current Biology.\n\n\u201cWe can say that the identified odors are strong candidates for sex pheromones,\u201d Touhara said, referring to chemical substances released by an animal that affects the behavior of other members of its species.\n\nUntil now, no pheromones have been identified in any primates, a group that also includes monkeys, apes and people, Touhara said.\n\n\u201cAlthough there are many circumstances in which humans utilize olfactory cues for communication, there is no authentic pheromone that has been chemically identified,\u201d Touhara said.\n\n\u201cI believe there is no classic sex pheromone in humans that elicits attractive behavior to the opposite sex.

They also found that the male scent worked its magic only during the breeding season when females were sexually receptive, as measured by the amount of time spent sniffing the scent during lab experiments.\n\nOutside of the breeding season, the researchers found, the male gland secretions smelled different - more bitter and leathery.

A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nIt might represent, they added, a type of supernova that until now has only been theorized.\n\nAstrophysicist Matt Nicholl of the University of Birmingham in England said two very massive stars - each about 50 times the sun\u2019s mass - may have merged to make one extremely massive star roughly 1,000 years before the explosion.

When a massive star - more than eight times the mass of our sun - uses up its fuel, it cools off and its core collapses, triggering shock waves that cause its outer layer to explode so violently that it can outshine entire galaxies.\n\nThe researchers, who observed the explosion for two years until it diminished to 1 percent of its maximum brightness, said it may have been an example of an extremely rare \u201cpulsational pair-instability\u201d supernova.\n\n\u201cPulsational pair-instability is when very massive stars undergo pulsations which eject material away from the star,\u201d said study co-author Peter Blanchard, a postdoctoral fellow in astrophysics at Northwestern University in Illinois.\n\n\u201cThis discovery shows that there are many exciting and new phenomena left to be uncovered in the universe,\u201d Blanchard added.\n\nVery massive stars like this one were probably more common early in the universe\u2019s history, Nicholl said.\n\n\u201cThe nature of those first stars is one of the big questions in astronomy,\u201d Nicholl added. \u201cIn astronomy, seeing things further away means looking back further and further in time.

Bellen were set on solving the mystery. The patient presented with an unidentified late-onset neurodegenerative disorder. The team named this new syndrome \"Mitchell disease\" in reference to the first patient to be diagnosed with this disorder and looked to identify its genetic basis.\n\n\"On comparing the patient's and his parents' DNA, the team identified a mutation in the patient that resulted in a single amino acid substitution (N237S) in the ACOX1 protein. This change was seen only in the patient and was not present in either of his parents' DNA, indicating that the patient had a de novo, or new, mutation on this gene,' said Bellen, professor at Baylor College of Medicine and investigator at the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children's Hospital and also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. \"With the help of the online gene-matching tool GeneMatcher, we found two more patients who had the same new mutation in the ACOX1 gene.\"\n\nAll three patients, who ranged from 3 to 12 years old at the time of disease onset, had remarkably similar clinical features, including degeneration of peripheral nerves that caused a progressive loss of mobility and hearing. The three individuals had identical gene variants, a clear indication that ACOX1 dysfunction likely was the cause of the symptoms.\n\nA medical mystery\n\nThe finding that an ACOX1 mutation was linked to Mitchell disease initially baffled the researchers. The only known ACOX1-related disorder described in the medical literature at that time presented earlier in infancy with seizures, severe cognitive decline, neuro-inflammation and accumulation of very-long-chain-fatty acids in plasma and, more importantly, was caused by the lack of the ACOX1 protein -- none of which was true for these three patients.\n\n\"The brain has large amounts of lipids, which are critical for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Abnormal breakdown of lipids in the brain and peripheral nervous system is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases,\" Bellen said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe gene ACOX1 is involved in lipid breakdown. It produces an enzyme called Acyl-CoA oxidase 1 that initiates a series of reactions that break down very-long-chain-fatty acids in small intracellular organelles called peroxisomes.\n\nFruit flies help solve the medical mystery\n\nTo resolve this conundrum, the Bellen team turned to fruit flies. The first surprising discovery made by the lead author, Hyunglok Chung, was that the ACOX1 protein is abundant and critical for the maintenance of glia, cells that support neurons. This uncovered a previously unknown role of peroxisomes in glial cells and paved the way for further experiments.\n\nTo understand how ACOX1 variants affect the function of glia, they generated two mutant fly lines, the first one lacked both the copies of ACOX1 gene and the second, carried the substitution mutation (N237S) found in one of the ACOX1 genes in the Mitchell disease patients.\n\n\"Flies lacking ACOX1 mimicked the symptoms of ACOX1 deficiency in humans, including elevated levels of very-long-chain-fatty acids along with dramatic loss of glia and neurons and progressively impaired neuronal function. When we reduced the synthesis of very-long-chain-fatty acids in these flies by administering the drug bezafibrate, we observed significant improvement in lifespan, vision, motor coordination and neuronal function, implicating elevated levels of these lipids and their excessive accumulation in glia as an important contributor,\" said Chung, postdoctoral fellow in the Bellen lab.\n\n\"It is remarkable how well bezafibrate suppressed the symptoms of ACOX1 deficiency, suggesting a new therapeutic avenue for patients with this condition,\" Bellen said.\n\nIn contrast to the loss of ACOX1, the introduction of the single amino acid substitution (N237S) in ACOX1 gene resulted in a hyperactive ACOX1 protein. Typically, breakdown of very-long-chain-fatty acids by the enzymatic action of ACOX1 produces small amounts of highly reactive oxygen species, but glial cells quickly neutralize them. However, in Mitchell's disease, hyperactive ACOX1 produces copious amounts of toxic reactive oxygen species, leading to the destruction of glia and their neighboring neurons.\n\nThe harmful effects due to hyperactive ACOX1 were potently reversed with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine amide (NACA). However, NACA did not suppress the lethality or toxic effects in flies that lacked ACOX1, a clear indication that the two diseases act via entirely different pathways and would need to be treated with two distinct therapeutic strategies.\n\n\"This study is a prime example of how combining UDN's unique team science approach with power of fruit fly genetics is facilitating rapid and phenomenal progress in rare diseases research. We take on cases of patients with conditions never described before, uncover new diseases and find definitive molecular diagnosis for them. We make significant progress in unraveling the causes of these novel diseases and rapidly identify and test promising new treatment options,\" Bellen said. \"We have successfully identified more than 25 disease-causing genes within the past three years -- a task that typically takes many years.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416151734.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T19:17:34", "title": "Study finds evidence for existence of elusive 'metabolon'", "text": "mFor more than 40 years, scientists have hypothesized the existence of enzyme clusters, or \"metabolons,\" in facilitating various processes within cells.

The findings could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies that disrupt the progression of cancer.\n\n\"Our study suggests that enzymes are not haphazardly located throughout cells, but instead occur in discrete clusters, or metabolons, that carry out specific metabolic pathways,\" said Stephen Benkovic, Evan Pugh University Professor and Eberly Chair in Chemistry. \"Not only did we find proof that metabolons exist, but we also found that this metabolon occurs near mitochondria in cancer cells.\"\n\nThe findings appear today (April 17) in the journal Science.\n\nIn the study, the team searched for a specific kind of metabolon, called a \"purinosome,\" that was thought to carry out \"de novo purine biosynthesis,\" the process by which new purines -- building blocks of DNA and RNA -- are synthesized. The researchers investigated these purinosomes within HeLa cells, a cervical cancer cell line commonly used in scientific research.\n\n\"We have shown that the de novo purine biosynthetic [DNPB] pathway is carried out by purinosomes consisting of at least nine enzymes acting together synergistically to increase their overall activity by at least by seven-fold,\" said Vidhi Pareek, assistant research professor, Department of Chemistry and the Huck Institutes of Life Sciences.\n\nThe researchers identified the purinosomes, which were less than a micrometer in diameter, using a novel imaging system developed by Nicholas Winograd, Evan Pugh University Professor of Chemistry, and colleagues. \"The technique utilizes gas cluster ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry [GCIB-SIMS] to detect intact biomolecules with high sensitivity and allow in situ chemical imaging in single cells,\" said Hua Tian, assistant research professor, Department of Chemistry and the Materials Research Institute.

Channeling occurs when enzymes are located close together so that the molecules produced are quickly transferred and processed along the enzymatic pathway, restricting equilibration with the bulk cytosol.\n\n\"Our experiment allowed us to show that the efficiency of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway is increased by channeling and that the proximity of purinosomes near mitochondria is consequential for the pathway,\" said Benkovic. \"These findings open the door to the study of a new class of cancer therapeutics; for example the design of a molecule that can disrupt purinosomes' juxtaposition with mitochondria.\"\n\nThe National Institutes of Health supported this research.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416151714.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T19:17:14", "title": "Researchers get important glimpse into microbiome development in early life: Critical new information on bacterial colonization of the infant gut", "text": "A team of researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) has characterized how the gut microbiome develops in the first hours of infancy, providing a critical baseline for how changes in this environment can impact health and disease later in life.

They analyzed the genomes of these bacteria to determine why they are growing in infants. Additionally, the team characterized the proteins and metabolites, or small molecules, that were present in the microbiome at this stage of development.\n\nOne of the challenges for collecting this information is that for the first several hours of life, any DNA collected from a stool sample is not from the bacteria but from the infant itself. The researchers did not see bacteria emerge in detectable concentrations until the infants were about 16 hours old.\n\nThe study team found evidence that the initial environment of the gut microbiome is anaerobic, contrary to the prevailing model which holds that the gut becomes anerobic only after bacteria grow and consume oxygen. The evidence came from observing the order in which amino acids were consumed by bacteria.\n\nThe study team also observed that metabolite levels were generally consistent with the detection of bacteria. Molecules typically produced by gut bacteria, like acetate and succinate, went up in samples where bacteria were detected. Additionally, the levels of select proteins went down in samples containing bacteria, suggesting that bacteria might have been consuming those proteins to promote growth.\n\nAnalysis of the three bacterial species studied in these infants revealed that multiple strains of each bacterium were already emerging.\n\n\"With the information we have, as we continue to follow these infants, we can track them and see how long these early strains of bacteria linger,\" Bittinger said. \"We can then see the consequences of this initial chemical activity in later samples and hopefully pinpoint early changes that might impact health later in childhood.\"\n\nThe researchers hope to use the study findings to determine how the development of the gut microbiome may influence excess weight gain.

The findings open opportunities to design antiviral drugs to counter rotavirus infection, the most common cause of diarrhea in children worldwide, resulting in approximately 200,000 deaths annually.\n\n\"Viruses cannot replicate on their own.

Capping of mRNA is an essential step to engage the cellular machinery that synthesizes proteins. Imitating the cell's capping enables the virus to take over the host's machinery to produce viral proteins.\n\nSeveral viruses use this strategy, but in different ways. In the case of rotavirus, it was known that the viral protein VP3 was involved in capping, but for more than three decades determining the structure of VP3 and understanding how it carried out mRNA capping had been a challenge.\n\nRotavirus VP3 protein is a unique capping machine\n\n\"Combining cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays, we discovered that VP3 has all the enzymatic activities required to effectively cap rotavirus mRNA. We also found that, opposed to what has been seen in many viruses that have individual proteins for each enzymatic activity, rotavirus integrates all the enzymatic actitivities as modules into one protein, VP3,\" said first author Dr. Dilip Kumar, postdoctoral fellow in the Prasad lab.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"What makes rotavirus different from most other viruses is that capping takes place inside the tight confines of the viral capsid, the protein shell of the virus, that is inside the cell. Once capping is complete, viral mRNA exits the capsid through channels and enters the cytoplasm of the cell where it engages the protein-making machinery to produce viral proteins,\" said co-author Dr. Mary K. Estes, Cullen Foundation Endowed Chair and Distinguished Service Professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor.\n\n\"Solving this puzzle was very exciting,\" Kumar said. \"We were able to isolate VP3 and its modules and show that they self-assemble into a stable molecule capable of capping at least two mRNAs simultaneously, making the process efficient.\"\n\nCrucial to this work were the collaborations with Dr. Zhao Wang, assistant professor in the Verna and Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and co-director of the CryoEM Core at Baylor, and his postdoctoral fellow Dr. Xinzhe Yu as well as Dr. Sue Crawford, assistant professor in the molecular virology and microbiology for the enzymatic and functional assays, and Dr. Liya Hu, assistant professor in the Verna and Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, for the modeling of cryo-EM-data.\n\nNext steps\n\nKnowing the structure of VP3 and how it works offers the opportunity to design antiviral drugs to prevent or treat rotavirus infection.

Many discoveries have been made, but there have been many missing pieces. Now, UNC School of Medicine scientists have conducted the largest-ever whole genome sequencing study of schizophrenia to provide a more complete picture of the role the human genome plays in this disease.\n\nPublished in Nature Communications, the study co-led by senior author Jin Szatkiewicz, PhD, associate professor in the UNC Department of Genetics, suggests that rare structural genetic variants could play a role in schizophrenia.\n\n\"Our results suggest that ultra-rare structural variants that affect the boundaries of a specific genome structure increase risk for schizophrenia,\" Szatkiewicz said. \"Alterations in these boundaries may lead to dysregulation of gene expression, and we think future mechanistic studies could determine the precise functional effects these variants have on biology.\"\n\nPrevious studies on the genetics of schizophrenia have primarily involved using common genetic variations known as SNPs (alterations in common genetic sequences and each affecting a single nucleotide), rare variations in the part of DNA that provide instructions for making proteins, or very large structural variations (alterations affecting a few hundred thousands of nucleotides). These studies give snapshots of the genome, leaving a large portion of the genome a mystery, as it potentially relates to schizophrenia.\n\nIn the Nature Communications study, Szatkiewicz and colleagues examined the entire genome, using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). The primary reason WGS hasn't been more widely used is that it is very expensive. For this study, an international collaboration pooled funding from National Institute of Mental Health grants and matching funds from Sweden's SciLife Labs to conduct deep whole genome sequencing on 1,165 people with schizophrenia and 1,000 controls -- the largest known WGS study of schizophrenia ever.\n\nAs a result, new discoveries were made. Previously undetectable mutations in DNA were found that scientists had never seen before in schizophrenia.\n\nIn particular, this study highlighted the role that a three-dimensional genome structure known as topologically associated domains (TADs) could play in the development of schizophrenia. TADs are distinct regions of the genome with strict boundaries between them that keep the domains from interacting with genetic material in neighboring TADs. Shifting or breaking these boundaries allows interactions between genes and regulatory elements that normally would not interact.\n\nWhen these interactions occur, gene expression may be changed in undesirable ways that could result in congenital defects, formation of cancers, and developmental disorders. This study found that extremely rare structural variants affecting TAD boundaries in the brain occur significantly more often in people with schizophrenia than in those without it. Structural variants are large mutations that may involve missing or duplicated genetic sequences, or sequences that are not in the typical genome. This finding suggests that misplaced or missing TAD boundaries may also contribute to the development of schizophrenia. This study was the first to discover the connection between anomalies in TADs and the development of schizophrenia.\n\nThis work has highlighted TADs-affecting structural variants as prime candidates for future mechanistic studies of the biology of schizophrenia.\n\n\"A possible future investigation would be to work with patient-derived cells with these TADs-affecting mutations and figure out what exactly happened at the molecular level,\" said Szatkiewicz, an adjunct assistant professor of psychiatry at UNC. \"In the future, we could use this information about the TAD effects to help develop drugs or precision medicine treatments that could repair disrupted TADs or affected gene expressions which may improve patient outcomes.\"\n\nThis study will be combined with other WGS studies in order to increase the sample size to further confirm these results.

These proteins are usually difficult to study because once they are extracted from the cell membrane, they only maintain their structure if they are suspended in special types of detergents.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAfter working on the problem for several years, Zhang and Qing developed a method for modifying the hydrophobic regions of these proteins, making them soluble in water and much easier to study. Their method, called the QTY code, calls for replacing some hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophilic amino acids that have similar structures. Leucine is converted to glutamine, isoleucine and valine are converted to threonine, and phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine.\n\nFollowing the development of the QTY code, Jin approached Zhang's lab with the idea of designing water-soluble versions of proteins known as cytokine receptors. These receptors are found on the surface of immune cells, where they bind to cytokines -- signaling proteins that stimulate inflammation and other immune responses.\n\nJin believed that proteins that mimic these cytokine receptors could help combat cytokine storms, which can be produced by viral or bacterial infections, including HIV and hepatitis. They can also occur as a side effect of cancer immunotherapy.\n\nIn April 2019, Zhang's team set out to design proteins that could sop up these excess cytokines like a sponge. To do that, they used the QTY code to make water-soluble versions of cytokine receptors. When proteins are soluble in water, they can travel efficiently through the human bloodstream, while the original, hydrophobic versions of the proteins would likely stick to cells that they encountered.\n\nThe researchers also attached an antibody segment called the Fc region to their water-soluble receptor proteins. This region helps to further stabilize the proteins in the bloodstream, and makes them less likely to be attacked by the immune system.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe researchers designed proteins that mimic six different cytokine receptors, which can bind to cytokines such as interferon and interleukin, as well as a class of cytokines called chemokines. In laboratory tests of the proteins' binding strength, the researchers found that their modified proteins were able to bind to cytokines with similar strength as naturally occurring cytokine receptors.\n\n\"The cytokine receptors that we designed will soak up the majority of the excessive cytokines that are released during the cytokine storm,\" Jin says.\n\nDriven by curiosity\n\nIn March, when evidence began to suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was inducing cytokine storms in some patients, the researchers realized that the receptor proteins they had designed might be able to help. They decided to quickly publish the results they have generated so far, and they are now planning to do additional tests in human cells and in animal models of Covid-19 infection.\n\nThe potential usefulness of this approach underscores the importance of \"curiosity-driven research,\" Zhang says.\n\n\"As it turns out, our research initiated in April 2019 is directly relevant to the treatment of Covid-19 infected patients,\" he says. \"Curiosity-driven, or even proactive research often leads to preparedness, which is key to preventing future disasters.\"\n\nThe researchers have filed for patents on the proteins that they designed, as well as on their overall approach to creating water-soluble cytokine receptors. They hope to license the technology quickly and to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotech companies who can help to move it toward clinical trials.\n\n\"Obviously this approach will need further animal studies, and potentially human clinical studies,\" Jin says. \"But we have confidence that this discovery will contribute to clinical applications to address viral diseases that involve cytokine storms.\"\n\nThe research was funded primarily by Avalon GloboCare, and also by a fellowship from the China Scholarship Council and Chongqing University, China.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416135944.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T17:59:44", "title": "Arctic stratospheric ozone levels hit record low in March", "text": "Ozone levels above the Arctic reached a record low for March, NASA researchers report. An analysis of satellite observations show that ozone levels reached their lowest point on March 12 at 205 Dobson units.\n\nWhile such low levels are rare, they are not unprecedented. Similar low ozone levels occurred in the upper atmosphere, or stratosphere, in 1997 and 2011. In comparison, the lowest March ozone value observed in the Arctic is usually around 240 Dobson units.\n\n\"This year's low Arctic ozone happens about once per decade,\" said Paul Newman, chief scientist for Earth Sciences at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"For the overall health of the ozone layer, this is concerning since Arctic ozone levels are typically high during March and April.\"\n\nOzone is a highly reactive molecule comprised of three oxygen atoms that occurs naturally in small amounts. The stratospheric ozone layer, roughly 7 to 25 miles above Earth's surface, is a sunscreen, absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation that can damage plants and animals and affecting people by causing cataracts, skin cancer and suppressed immune systems.\n\nThe March Arctic ozone depletion was caused by a combination of factors that arose due to unusually weak upper atmospheric \"wave\" events from December through March. These waves drive movements of air through the upper atmosphere akin to weather systems that we experience in the lower atmosphere, but much bigger in scale.\n\nIn a typical year, these waves travel upward from the mid-latitude lower atmosphere to disrupt the circumpolar winds that swirl around the Arctic. When they disrupt the polar winds, they do two things. First, they bring with them ozone from other parts of the stratosphere, replenishing the reservoir over the Arctic.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Think of it like having a red-paint dollop, low ozone over the North Pole, in a white bucket of paint,\" Newman said. \"The waves stir the white paint, higher amounts of ozone in the mid-latitudes, with the red paint or low ozone contained by the strong jet stream circling around the pole.\"\n\nThe mixing has a second effect, which is to warm the Arctic air. The warmer temperatures then make conditions unfavorable for the formation of polar stratospheric clouds. These clouds enable the release of chlorine for ozone-depleting reactions. Ozone depleting chlorine and bromine come from chlorofluorocarbons and halons, the chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine derived from human-made compounds that are now banned by the Montreal Protocol. The mixing shuts down this chlorine and bromine driven ozone depletion.\n\nIn December 2019 and January through March of 2020, the stratospheric wave events were weak and did not disrupt the polar winds. The winds thus acted like a barrier, preventing ozone from other parts of the atmosphere from replenishing the low ozone levels over the Arctic. In addition, the stratosphere remained cold, leading to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds which allowed chemical reactions to release reactive forms of chlorine and cause ozone depletion.\n\n\"We don't know what caused the wave dynamics to be weak this year,\" Newman said. \"But we do know that if we hadn't stopped putting chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere because of the Montreal Protocol, the Arctic depletion this year would have been much worse.\"\n\nSince 2000, levels of chlorofluorocarbons and other human-made ozone-depleting substances have measurably decreased in the atmosphere and continue to do so. Chlorofluorocarbons are long-lived compounds that take decades to break down, and scientists expect stratospheric ozone levels to recover to 1980 levels by mid-century.\n\nNASA researchers prefer the term \"depletion\" over the Arctic, since despite the ozone layer's record low this year, the ozone loss is still much less than the annual ozone \"hole\" that occurs over Antarctica in September and October during Southern Hemisphere spring. For comparison, ozone levels over Antarctica typically drop to about 120 Dobson units.\n\nNASA, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, monitors stratospheric ozone using satellites, including NASA's Aura satellite, the NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite and NOAA's Joint Polar Satellite System NOAA-20. The Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Aura satellite also estimates stratospheric levels of ozone-destroying chlorine.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416135938.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T17:59:38", "title": "Male ring-tail lemurs exude fruity-smelling perfume from their wrists to attract mates", "text": "Humans aren't the only primates who like smelling nice for their dates. In the journal Current Biology on April 16, scientists report that male ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) become more attractive to females by secreting a fruity and floral aroma from their wrists. Using detailed chemical analysis, the researchers identified three compounds responsible for this sweet scent, marking the first time that pheromones have been identified in a primate.\n\n\"During the yearly breeding season, male lemurs rub the glands on their wrists against their fluffy tails and then wave them at females in a behavior called 'stink flirting,'\" says senior author Kazushige Touhara, professor and biochemist at the University of Tokyo.\n\nRing-tailed lemurs have well-developed scent glands on their shoulders and wrists. These glands are typically used to designate social rank, territory, and reproductive status. However, behavioral observations show they also use their scent glands to catch the attention of females. \"Since only ring-tailed lemurs have these wrist glands and exhibit 'stink flirting' behavior, we reasoned that specific odorants for sexual communication must be involved,\" Touhara says.\n\nAt the Japanese Monkey Center (JMC) in Aichi and The Research Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Tokyo, Japan, Touhara and his team tracked the behavior of a conspiracy of ring-tailed lemurs. They observed that female lemurs sniffed the scent markings left by males more often and for longer periods of time during the breeding season -- when females are sexually receptive. Furthermore, when researchers isolated the primate perfume from four males and presented it to females individually, they found that females sniffed the fruity-smelling odor for roughly twice as long as the bitter-smelling gland secretions produced off-season.\n\n\"Females sniff the floral and fruity scent for a few more seconds than the controls and occasionally even lick it. Although this sounds like a very short time, it's enough to recognize or evoke curiosities in the male,\" says Touhara.\n\nUsing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis on the of the wrist-gland secretions produced during breeding and non-breeding seasons, Touhara determined the major chemical components making up the male scents. Three aldehyde compounds -- dodecanal, 12-methyltridecanal, and tetradecanal -- were present in both odors but showed substantially higher concentrations during the breeding season. Moreover, when the compounds were individually presented to females in the JMC enclosure, researchers found that only the mixture of all three had a significant ability to hold a female's attention.\n\n\"All three compounds have been suggested to be involved in the recognition of newborn sheep by their mothers, and tetradecanal is known as a sex pheromone in some insect species. Although this is the first time 12-methyltridecanal has been identified in primate species, all three aldehydes appear to be used as communication tools widely throughout the animal kingdom,\" says Touhara.\n\nYoung, sexually mature males naturally produce more of these compounds than their senior male counterparts -- most likely because aged males produce less testosterone. Furthermore, scientists have observed that females past their reproductive prime are altogether unimpressed by the fruity-smelling odors males exude. These findings suggest that the three compounds are, indeed, pheromones, but more work is required to determine whether they directly influence sexual behavior. \"While we have not examined behavioral changes after the sniff in detail, this is an area for future work to determine whether these pheromones impact mating success.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416114543.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T15:45:43", "title": "Treatment for spasticity in mice, following spinal cord injuries discovered", "text": "In experiments with mice, researchers have studied neuronal mechanisms and found a way to by and large prevent spasticity from developing after spinal cord injuries. A new study from the University of Copenhagen shows that the researchers have done this by using already approved medicine for high blood pressure.\n\nSpinal cord injury can be highly debilitating and affect motor skills, the sensation as well as autonomic brain functions. Besides, the injury will often lead to the development of spasticity which manifests itself in involuntary, sustained or rhythmic muscle contractions. It is estimated that 70 percent of those who have a spinal cord injury will develop spasticity.\n\nNow, researchers from the University of Copenhagen have discovered a possible treatment -- tested on mice -- against the development of spasticity following a spinal cord injury. After the treatment, the mice showed no or only modest signs of spasticity.\n\nThe researchers treated the mice with the drug nimodipine, which is an already approved drug that has been used since the 1980s.\n\n'We show that nimodipine by and large can prevent the development of spasticity after a spinal cord injury if administered soon after the injury and for an extended period of time. One of the most surprising and interesting elements in the study is that the effect continues, even after treatment has stopped', says co-author Ole Kiehn, Professor at the Department of Neuroscience.\n\nThe new results have been published in the scientific journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Effect is Long-Lasting\n\nNimodipine is a drug that is used, among other things, against high blood pressure. The researchers' experiments showed that treatment with nimodipine must be started immediately after the spinal cord injury has occurred, otherwise it will not work.\n\nIn addition, the treatment must continue for an extended period of time. In the experiment, the mice were treated with the drug for six weeks and then observed for nine weeks, where they developed no or only mild signs of spasticity.\n\nThe most surprising thing to the researchers was that the effect was long-lasting.\n\n'We had guessed that the spasticity would be blocked for as long as the pharmacological treatment was ongoing. But we were positively surprised to see that the development of spasticity remained blocked even after we stopped the pharmacological treatment', says co-author Carmelo Bellardita, Postdoc at the Department of Neuroscience.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlocked Calcium Channel\n\nNimodipine works by blocking calcium channels -- which belong to the group of so-called L-type calcium channels -- found in many nerve cells in the spinal cord.\n\nIn the study, the researchers show that the effect of nimodipine is due to the blocking of one specific L-type calcium channel, the so-called CaV1.3 channel. By genetically removing that type of calcium channels in the spinal cord of mice, they achieved the same result: the development of spasticity was blocked.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the results could potentially also be relevant to other diseases where spasticity may develop. For example, in connection with multiple sclerosis and stroke.\n\nIt is still uncertain whether nimodipine will have the same effect on human spasticity as all experiments have been done on mice. The researchers will now study this question.\n\n'We are quite optimistic that nimodipine will have the same effect in humans. But we cannot be certain. Nimodipine is an approved drug that easily enters the brain, and we will now begin trials together with other researchers where we test nimodipine on healthy test subjects to study the effect on various reflexes and motor skills. Subsequently, it may potentially be possible to test the drug on people with spasticity', says Ole Kiehn.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416114541.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T15:45:41", "title": "CHEOPS space telescope ready for scientific operation", "text": "CHEOPS is a joint mission by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Switzerland, under the leadership of the University of Bern in collaboration with the University of Geneva (UNIGE). After almost three months of extensive testing, with part of it in the midst of the lockdown to contain the coronavirus, on Wednesday, March 25, 2020, ESA declared the CHEOPS space telescope ready for science. With this achievement, ESA has handed over the responsibility to operate CHEOPS to the mission consortium, which consists of scientists and engineers from approximately 30 institutions in 11 European countries.\n\nSuccessful completion of the CHEOPS test phase despite the coronavirus crisis\n\nThe successful completion of the test phase took place in very challenging times, with essentially all the mission team being required to work from home towards the end of the phase. \"The completion of the test phase was only possible with the full commitment of all the participants, and because the mission has an operational control system that is largely automated, allowing commands to be sent and data to be received from home,\" explains Willy Benz, Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Bern and Principal Investigator of the CHEOPS mission.\n\nA team of scientists, engineers and technicians put CHEOPS through a period of extensive testing and calibration from the beginning of January until the end of March. \"We were thrilled when we realized that all the systems worked as expected or even better than expected,\" explains CHEOPS Instrument Scientist Andrea Fortier from the Univerisity of Bern, who led the commissioning team of the consortium.\n\nMeeting high requirements on measuring accuracy\n\nThe team began by focusing on the evaluation of the photometric performance of the space telescope. CHEOPS has been conceptualized as a device of exceptional precision capable of detecting exoplanets the size of planet Earth. \"The most critical test was in the precise measurement of the brightness of a star to a variance of 0.002% (20 parts-per-million),\" explains Willy Benz. This precision is required so as to clearly recognize the dimming caused by the passage of an Earth-sized planet in front of a Sun-like star (an event known as a \"transit,\" which can last several hours). CHEOPS was also required to demonstrate its ability to maintain this degree of precision for up to two days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCHEOPS surpasses the requirements\n\nTo verify this, the team focused on a star known as HD 88111. The star is located in the Hydra constellation, some 175 light years away from Earth, and it is not known to host planets. CHEOPS took an image of the star every 30 seconds for 47 consecutive hours (see Figure 1). Every image was carefully analyzed, initially using a specialized automatic software package, and subsequently by the team members, to determine in each image the brightness of the star as accurately as possible. The team had expected the brightness of the star to change during the period of observation due to a variety of effects, such as other stars in the field of view, the tiny jitter motion of the satellite, or the impact of cosmic ray hits on the detector.\n\nThe results of the 5,640 photos taken by CHEOPS over 47 hours are shown in Figure 2 as a \"light curve.\" The curve depicts the change over time in the brightness measurements from all the images, showing a root-mean-square scatter of 0.0015% (15 parts-per-million). \"The light curve measured by CHEOPS was pleasingly flat. The space telescope easily surpasses the requirement for being able to measure brightness to a precision of 0.002% (20 parts-per-million),\" explains Christopher Broeg, Mission Manager for the CHEOPS mission at the University of Bern.\n\nAn exoplanet that would float\n\nThe team observed other stars, including some known to host planets (these are called exoplanets). CHEOPS focused on the planetary system HD 93396 which is in the Sextans constellation, some 320 light years away from Earth. This system consists of a giant exoplanet called KELT-11b, which was discovered in 2016 to orbit this star in 4.7 days. The star is almost three times the size of the sun.\n\nThe team chose this particular system because the star is so big that the planet takes a long time to pass in front of it: in fact, almost eight hours. \"This gave CHEOPS the opportunity to demonstrate its ability to capture long transit events otherwise difficult to observe from the ground, as the 'astronomical' part of the night for ground-based astronomy usually takes less than eight hours,\" explains Didier Queloz, professor at the Astronomy Department of the Faculty of Science at the University of Geneva and spokesperson of the CHEOPS Science Team. The first transit light curve of CHEOPS is shown in Figure 3, where the dip due to the planet occurs approximately nine hours after the he beginning of the observation.\n\nThe transit of KELT-11b measured by CHEOPS enabled determining the size of the exoplanet. It has a diameter of 181,600 km, which CHEOPS is able to measure with an accuracy of 4'290 km. The diameter of the Earth, in comparison, is only approximately 12,700 km, while that of Jupiter -- the biggest planet in our solar system -- is 139,900 km. Exoplanet KELT-11b is therefore bigger than Jupiter, but its mass is five times lower, which means it has an extremely low density: \"It would float on water in a big-enough swimming pool,\" says David Ehrenreich, CHEOPS Mission Scientist from the University of Geneva. The limited density is attributed to the close proximity of the planet to its star. Figure 4 shows a drawing of the first transit planet system to be successfully observed by CHEOPS.\n\nBenz explains that the measurements by CHEOPS are five times more accurate than those from Earth. \"That gives us a foretaste for what we can achieve with CHEOPS over the months and years to come,\" continues Benz.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416114539.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T15:45:39", "title": "Returning land to nature with high-yield farming", "text": "The expansion of farmlands to meet the growing food demand of the world's ever expanding population places a heavy burden on natural ecosystems. A new IIASA study however shows that about half the land currently needed to grow food crops could be spared if attainable crop yields were achieved globally and crops were grown where they are most productive.\n\nThe land sparing debate, which was sparked around 2005 by conservation biologists, recognized that there is usually a limit to the extent to which farmland can be made 'wildlife friendly' without compromising yields, while most threatened species only profit from the sparing or restoration of their natural habitats. Interest in this topic recently gained new momentum through the Half Earth project, which aims to return half the area of land currently being used for other purposes to natural land cover to restrict biodiversity loss and address other impacts of land use such as greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAccording to the authors of the study published in Nature Sustainability, the need for this type of strategy is urgent, given the increasing global demand for agricultural products. The study is the first to provide insight into the amount of cropland that would be required to fulfill present crop demands at high land use efficiency without exacerbating major agricultural impacts globally.\n\n\"The main questions we wanted to address were how much cropland could be spared if attainable crop yields were achieved globally and crops were grown where they are most productive. In addition, we wanted to determine what the implications would be for other factors related to the agricultural sector, including fertilizer and irrigation water requirements, greenhouse gas emissions, carbon sequestration potential, and wildlife habitat available for threatened species,\" explains study lead author Christian Folberth, a researcher in the IIASA Ecosystems Services and Management Program.\n\nThe study results indicate that with high nutrient inputs and reallocation of crops on present cropland, only about half the present cropland would be required to produce the same amounts of major crops. The other half could then in principle be used to restore natural habitats or other landscape elements. The findings also show that land use is currently somewhat inefficient and not primarily due to the upper limits to crop yields as determined by climate in many parts of the world, rather, it is strongly subject to management decisions.\n\nIt is difficult to say exactly how much biodiversity is impacted as a direct result of agricultural activities, but it is estimated to exceed safe boundaries, primarily due to habitat loss. In this regard, the researchers evaluated two scenarios: the first proposes maximum land sparing without constraints, except for the present cropland extent, while the second scenario puts forward targeted land sparing that abandons cropland in biodiversity hotspots and uniformly releases 20% of cropland globally. There were only marginal differences between the two scenarios in most aspects, except for wildlife habitat, which only increased significantly with targeted land sparing. This however still enabled reducing the cropland requirement by almost 40%.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers found that greenhouse gas emissions and irrigation water requirements are likely to decrease with a reduced area of cultivated land, while global fertilizer input requirements would remain unchanged. Spared cropland could also provide space for substantial carbon sequestration in restored natural vegetation. Yet, potentially adverse local impacts of intensive farming and land sparing such as nutrient pollution or loss of income in rural areas will need to be studied further.\n\n\"The results of our study can help policymakers and the wider public to benchmark results of integrated land use scenarios. It also shows that cropland expansion is not inevitable and that there is significant potential for improving present land use efficiency. If the right policies are implemented, measures such as improved production technologies can be just as effective as demand-side measures like dietary changes,\" says project lead and former IIASA Ecosystems Services and Management Program Director Michael Obersteiner. \"However, in all cases such a process would need to be steered by policies to avoid unwanted outcomes.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416114537.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T15:45:37", "title": "New photon-counting camera captures 3D images with record speed and resolution", "text": "Researchers have developed the first megapixel photon-counting camera based on new-generation image sensor technology that uses single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs).

Charbon developed the idea for the new camera and is the founder and head of AQUALab, where the image sensor was designed.\n\nIn Optica, The Optical Society's (OSA) journal for high-impact research, the researchers describe how they created one of the smallest SPAD pixels ever devised and reduced the power consumption of each pixel to less than 1 microwatt while maintaining speed and timing precision.

This technology's success comes from the fact that SPAD sensors are extremely efficient at detecting single photons and converting them into electrical signals that are stored in a digital memory. A large format camera can be created by building an array of pixels that each contain a SPAD.\n\nIn the new work, the researchers drew on 15 years of SPAD research at the AQUALab in EPFL to create an extremely fast, high-resolution camera that leverages SPAD technology for advanced imaging. The new camera detects single photons and converts them into electrical signals at a record rate of about 150 million times per second. Each SPAD sensor can be finely controlled to allow light in for as little as 3.8 nanoseconds, roughly four billionth of a second. This quick 'shutter speed' can capture extremely fast motion or be used to increase the dynamic range -- the difference between the darkest and lightest tones -- of an acquired image.\n\nThe researchers created extremely small SPAD pixels and designed for low power consumption by using a feedback mechanism that almost immediately quenches the avalanche of electrons triggered by photon detection. This improves the overall performance and reliability of the pixels. They also used enhanced layout techniques to pack the SPAD sensors tighter, thus upping the detection area density and enabling a camera with a million pixels.\n\nThe researchers then applied sophisticated integrated circuit design techniques to create an extremely uniform distribution of fast electrical signals over the large-scale pixel array. They showed that the shutter speeds varied by only 3 percent over the million pixels, demonstrating that this sensor could feasibly be made using available mass-production techniques.\n\nHigh-speed 3D imaging\n\nThe camera's speed makes it possible to measure the time a photon hits the sensor very precisely. This information can be used to calculate how long it takes individual photons to travel the distance from a source to the camera, known as time-of-flight. Combining time-of-flight information with the ability to capture a million pixels simultaneously enables extremely high-speed reconstruction of 3D images.\n\nThe researchers used the new camera to determine the time-of-flight of photons emitted from a laser source and reflected by a target. They also captured complex scenes that are difficult for other imaging techniques to measure, such as an object viewed through a partially transparent window, and they used the camera to acquire conventional pictures with unprecedented dynamic ranges. In future they plan to further improve the performance and timing resolution of the camera and to further miniaturize the components to make it more practical for a variety of applications.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416114535.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T15:45:35", "title": "Psychedelic compound from magic mushrooms produced in yeast", "text": "Psilocybin mushrooms have been found to have minimal harmful effects and could potentially benefit those with depression.

While previous searches with a computer algorithm misidentified it, researchers reviewing Kepler data took a second look at the signature and recognized it as a planet. Out of all the exoplanets found by Kepler, this distant world -- located 300 light-years from Earth -- is most similar to Earth in size and estimated temperature.\n\nThis newly revealed world is only 1.06 times larger than our own planet. Also, the amount of starlight it receives from its host star is 75% of the amount of light Earth receives from our Sun -- meaning the exoplanet's temperature may be similar to our planet's as well. But unlike Earth, it orbits a red dwarf. Though none have been observed in this system, this type of star is known for stellar flare-ups that may make a planet's environment challenging for any potential life.\n\n\"This intriguing, distant world gives us even greater hope that a second Earth lies among the stars, waiting to be found,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"The data gathered by missions like Kepler and our Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite [TESS] will continue to yield amazing discoveries as the science community refines its abilities to look for promising planets year after year.\"\n\nThere is still much that is unknown about Kepler-1649c, including its atmosphere, which could affect the planet's temperature. Current calculations of the planet's size have significant margins of error, as do all values in astronomy when studying objects so far away. But based on what is known, Kepler-1649c is especially intriguing for scientists looking for worlds with potentially habitable conditions.\n\nThere are other exoplanets estimated to be closer to Earth in size, such as TRAPPIST-1f and, by some calculations, Teegarden c. Others may be closer to Earth in temperature, such as TRAPPIST-1d and TOI 700d.

The system has another rocky planet of about the same size, but it orbits the star at about half the distance of Kepler-1649c, similar to how Venus orbits our Sun at about half the distance that Earth does. Red dwarf stars are among the most common in the galaxy, meaning planets like this one could be more common than we previously thought.\n\nLooking for False Positives\n\nPreviously, scientists on the Kepler mission developed an algorithm called Robovetter to help sort through the massive amounts of data produced by the Kepler spacecraft, managed by NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley. Kepler searched for planets using the transit method, staring at stars, looking for dips in brightness as planets passed in front of their host stars.\n\nMost of the time, those dips come from phenomena other than planets -- ranging from natural changes in a star's brightness to other cosmic objects passing by -- making it look like a planet is there when it's not. Robovetter's job was to distinguish the 12% of dips that were real planets from the rest. Those signatures Robovetter determined to be from other sources were labeled \"false positives,\" the term for a test result mistakenly classified as positive.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith an enormous number of tricky signals, astronomers knew the algorithm would make mistakes and would need to be double-checked -- a perfect job for the Kepler False Positive Working Group. That team reviews Robovetter's work, going through each false positive to ensure they are truly errors and not exoplanets, ensuring fewer potential discoveries are overlooked. As it turns out, Robovetter had mislabeled Kepler-1649c.\n\nEven as scientists work to further automate analysis processes to get the most science as possible out of any given dataset, this discovery shows the value of double-checking automated work. Even six years after Kepler stopped collecting data from the original Kepler field -- a patch of sky it stared at from 2009 to 2013, before going on to study many more regions -- this rigorous analysis uncovered one of the most unique Earth analogs discovered yet.\n\nA Possible Third Planet\n\nKepler-1649c not only is one of the best matches to Earth in terms of size and energy received from its star, but it provides an entirely new look at its home system. For every nine times the outer planet in the system orbits the host star, the inner planet orbits almost exactly four times. The fact that their orbits match up in such a stable ratio indicates the system itself is extremely stable and likely to survive for a long time.\n\nNearly perfect period ratios are often caused by a phenomenon called orbital resonance, but a nine-to-four ratio is relatively unique among planetary systems. Usually resonances take the form of ratios such as two-to-one or three-to-two. Though unconfirmed, the rarity of this ratio could hint to the presence of a middle planet with which both the inner and outer planets revolve in synchronicity, creating a pair of three-to-two resonances.\n\nThe team looked for evidence of such a mystery third planet, with no results. However, that could be because the planet is too small to see or at an orbital tilt that makes it impossible to find using Kepler's transit method.\n\nEither way, this system provides yet another example of an Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a red dwarf star. These small and dim stars require planets to orbit extremely close to be within that zone -- not too warm and not too cold -- for life as we know it to potentially exist. Though this single example is only one among many, there is increasing evidence that such planets are common around red dwarfs.\n\n\"The more data we get, the more signs we see pointing to the notion that potentially habitable and Earth-size exoplanets are common around these kinds of stars,\" said Vanderburg. \"With red dwarfs almost everywhere around our galaxy, and these small, potentially habitable and rocky planets around them, the chance one of them isn't too different than our Earth looks a bit brighter.\"\n\nFor more information about Kepler and its discoveries, go to: https://www.nasa.gov/kepler", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416094214.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T13:42:14", "title": "Could shrinking a key component help make autonomous cars affordable?", "text": "Engineers and business leaders have been working on autonomous cars for years, but there's one big obstacle to making them cheap enough to become commonplace: They've needed a way to cut the cost of lidar, the technology that enables robotic navigation systems to spot and avoid pedestrians and other hazards along the roadway by bouncing light waves off these potential obstacles.\n\nToday's lidars use complex mechanical parts to send the flashlight-sized infrared lasers spinning around like the old-fashioned, bubblegum lights atop police cars -- at a cost of $8,000 to $30,000.\n\nBut now a team led by electrical engineer Jelena Vuckovic is working on shrinking the mechanical and electronic components in a rooftop lidar down to a single silicon chip that she thinks could be mass produced for as little as a few hundred dollars.\n\nThe project grows out of years of research by Vuckovic's lab to find a practical way to take advantage of a simple fact: Much like sunlight shines through glass, silicon is transparent to the infrared laser light used by lidar (short for light detection and ranging).\n\nIn a study published in Nature Photonics, the researchers describe how they structured the silicon in a way that used its infrared transparency to control, focus and harness the power of photons, the quirky particles that constitute light beams.\n\nThe team used a process called inverse design that Vuckovic's lab has pioneered over the past decade. Inverse design relies on a powerful algorithm that drafts a blueprint for the actual photonic circuits that perform specific functions -- in this case, shooting a laser beam out ahead of a car to locate objects in the road and routing the reflected light back to a detector. Based on the delay between when the light pulse is sent forward and when the beam reflects back to the detector, lidars measure the distance between car and objects.\n\nIt took Vuckovic's team two years to create the circuit layout for the lidar-on-a-chip prototype they built in the Stanford nanofabrication facility. Postdoctoral scholar Ki Youl Yang and PhD student Jinhie Skarda played key roles in that process, with crucial theoretical insights from City University of New York physicist Andrea Al\u00f9 and CUNY postdoctoral scholar Michele Cotrufo.\n\nBuilding this range-finding mechanism on a chip is just the first -- though essential -- step toward creating inexpensive lidars. The researchers are now working on the next milestone, ensuring that the laser beam can sweep in a circle without using expensive mechanical parts. Vuckovic estimates her lab is about three years away from building a prototype that would be ready for a road test.\n\n\"We are on a trajectory to build a lidar-on-a-chip that is cheap enough to help create a mass market for autonomous cars,\" Vuckovic said.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416094212.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T13:42:12", "title": "Genetics linked to childhood emotional, social and psychiatric problems", "text": "Emotional, social and psychiatric problems in children and adolescents have been linked to higher levels of genetic vulnerability for adult depression.\n\nUniversity of Queensland scientists made the finding while analysing the genetic data of more than 42,000 children and adolescents from seven cohorts across Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and UK.\n\nProfessor Christel Middeldorp said researchers have also found a link with a higher genetic vulnerability for insomnia, neuroticism and body mass index.\n\n\"By contrast, study participants with higher genetic scores for educational attainment and emotional wellbeing were found to have reduced childhood problems,\" Professor Middeldorp said.\n\n\"We calculated a person's level of genetic vulnerability by adding up the number of risk genes they had for a specific disorder or trait, and then made adjustments based on the level of importance of each gene.\n\n\"We found the relationship was mostly similar across ages.\"\n\nThe results indicate there are shared genetic factors that affect a range of psychiatric and related traits across a person's lifespan.\n\nProfessor Christel Middeldorp said around 50 per cent of children and adolescents with psychiatric problems, such as attention deficit hyper-activity disorder (ADHD), continue to experience mental disorders as adults, and are at risk of disengaging with their school community among other social and emotional problems.\n\n\"Our findings are important as they suggest this continuity between childhood and adult traits is partly explained by genetic risk,\" Professor Christel Middeldorp said.\n\n\"Individuals at risk of being affected should be the focus of attention and targeted treatment..\n\n\"Although genetic vulnerability is not accurate enough at this stage to make individual predictions about how a person's symptoms will develop over time, it may become so in the future, in combination with other risk factors.\n\n\"And, this may support precision medicine by providing targeted treatments to children at the highest risk of persistent emotional and social problems.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416091953.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T13:19:53", "title": "Bornean treeshrews can take the heat", "text": "As human activity shapes Earth's climate, animals must increasingly adapt to new environmental conditions.

Information Theory may provide the answer", "text": "It's almost impossible to imagine biology without individuals -- individual organisms, individual cells, and individual genes, for example. But what about a worker ant that never reproduces, and could never survive apart from the colony? Are the trillions of microorganisms in our microbiomes, which vastly outnumber our human cells, part of our individuality?\n\n\"Despite the near-universal assumption of individuality in biology, there is little agreement about what individuals are and few rigorous quantitative methods for their identification,\" write the authors of new work published in the journal Theory in Biosciences. The problem, they note in the paper, is analogous to identifying a figure from its background in a Gestalt psychology drawing. Like the famous image of two faces outlining a vase, an individual life form and its environment create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nOne way to solve the puzzle comes from information theory. Instead of focusing on anatomical traits, like cell walls, authors David Krakauer, Nils Bertschinger, Eckehard Olbrich, Jessica Flack, and Nihat Ay look to structured information flows between a system and its environment. \"Individuals,\" they argue, \"are best thought of in terms of dynamical processes and not as stationary objects.\"\n\nThe individual as a verb: what processes produce distinct identity? Flack stresses that this lens allows for individuality to be \"continuous rather than binary, nested, and possible at any level.\" An information theory of individuality (or ITI) describes emergent agency at different scales and with distributed communication networks (e.g., both ants and colonies at once).\n\nThe authors use a model that suggests three kinds of individual, each corresponding to a different blend of self-regulation and environmental influence. Decomposing information like this gives a gradient: it ranges from environmentally-scaffolded forms like whirlpools, to partially-scaffolded colonial forms like coral reefs and spider webs, to organismal individuals that are sculpted by their environment but strongly self-organizing.\n\nEach is a strategy for propagating information forward through time -- meaning, Flack adds, \"individuality is about temporal uncertainty reduction.\" Replication here emerges as just one of many strategies for individuals to order information in their future. To Flack, this \"leaves us free to ask what role replication plays in temporal uncertainty reduction through the creation of individuals,\" a question close to asking why we find life in the first place.\n\nPerhaps the biggest implication of this work is in how it places the observer at the center of evolutionary theory. \"Just as in quantum mechanics,\" Krakauer says, \"where the state of a system depends on measurement, the measurements we call natural selection dictate the preferred form of the individual. Who does the measuring? What we find depends on what the observer is capable of seeing.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416091949.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T13:19:49", "title": "Lung-heart super sensor on a chip tinier than a ladybug: The future of socially distanced lung and heart health monitoring could lie in an inconspicuous yet incredibly sensitive MEMS chip", "text": "During a stroll, a woman's breathing becomes a slight bit shallower, and a monitor in her clothing alerts her to get a telemedicine check-up. A new study details how a sensor chip smaller than a ladybug records multiple lung and heart signals along with body movements and could enable such a future socially distanced health monitor.\n\nThe core mechanism of the chip developed by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology involves two finely manufactured layers of silicon, which overlay each other separated by the space of 270 nanometers -- about 0.005 the width of a human hair. They carry a minute voltage.\n\nVibrations from bodily motions and sounds put part of the chip in flux, making the voltage flux, too, thus creating readable electronic outputs. In human testing, the chip has recorded a variety of signals from the mechanical workings of the lungs and the heart with clarity, signals that often escape meaningful detection by current medical technology.\n\n\"Right now, medicine looks to EKGs (electrocardiograms) for information on the heart, but EKGs only measure electrical impulses. The heart is a mechanical system with muscles pumping and valves opening and shutting, and it sends out a signature of sounds and motions, which an EKG does not detect. EKGs also say nothing about lung function,\" said Farrokh Ayazi, Ken Byers Professor in Georgia Tech's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.\n\nStethoscope-accelerometer combo\n\nThe chip, which acts as an advanced electronic stethoscope and accelerometer in one, is aptly called an accelerometer contact microphone. It detects vibrations that enter the chip from inside the body while keeping out distracting noise from outside the body's core like airborne sounds\n\n\"If it rubs on my skin or shirt, it doesn't hear the friction, but the device is very sensitive to sounds coming at it from inside the body, so it picks up useful vibrations even through clothing,\" Ayazi said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe detection bandwidth is enormous -- from broad, sweeping motions to inaudibly high-pitched tones. Thus, the sensor chip records all at once fine details of the heartbeat, pulse waves traversing the body's tissues, respiration rates, and lung sounds. It even tracks the wearer's physical activities such as walking.\n\nThe signals are recorded in sync, potentially offering the big picture of a patient's heart and lung health. For the study, the researchers successfully recorded a \"gallop,\" a faint third sound after the \"lub-dub\" of the heartbeat. Gallops are normally elusive clues of heart failure.\n\nThe researchers published their results in the journal npj Digital Medicine on February 12, 2020. The research was funded by the Georgia Research Alliance, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health. Study coauthor Divya Gupta, M.D., a cardiologist at Emory University, collaborated in testing the chip on human participants.\n\nHermetically sealed vacuum\n\nMedical research has tried to make better use of the body's mechanical signals for decades but recording some -- like waves traversing multiple tissues -- has proven inconsistent, while others -- like gallops -- have relied upon clinician skills influenced by human error. The new chip produces high-resolution, quantified data that future research could match to pathologies in order to identify them.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"We are working already to collect significantly more data matched with pathologies. We envision algorithms in the future that may enable a broad array of clinical readings,\" Ayazi said.\n\nThough the chip's main engineering principle is simple, making it work and then manufacturable took Ayazi's lab ten years, mainly because of the Lilliputian scale of the gap between the silicon layers, i.e. electrodes. If the 2-millimeter by 2-millimeter sensor chip were expanded to the size of a football field, that air gap would be about an inch wide.\n\n\"That very thin gap separating the two electrodes cannot have any contact, not even by forces in the air in between the layers, so the whole sensor is hermetically sealed inside a vacuum cavity,\" Ayazi said. \"This makes for that ultralow signal noise and breadth of bandwidth that are unique.\"\n\nDetects through clothing\n\nThe researchers used a manufacturing process developed in Ayazi's lab called the HARPSS+ platform (High Aspect Ratio Poly and Single Crystalline Silicon) for mass production, running off hand-sized sheets that were then cut into the tiny sensor chips. HARPSS+ is the first reported mass manufacturing process that achieves such consistently thin gaps, and it has enabled high-throughput manufacturing of many such advanced MEMS, or microelectromechanical systems.\n\nThe experimental device is currently battery-powered and uses a second chip called a signal-conditioning circuit to translate the sensor chip's signals into patterned read-outs.\n\nThree sensors or more could be inserted into a chest band that would triangulate health signals to locate their sources.

Moreover, favas are a better alternative for the environment:\n\n\"Many consumers are crying out for alternatives to soy, a crop that places great strain on the environment.

This has had severely negative consequences for wildlife, biodiversity and CO2 emissions.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Another important factor is that, unlike fava beans, lots of soy is genetically modified to be able to tolerate Roundup, an herbicide. Within this context, many consumers are critical of soy's environmental consequences,\" explains Iben Lykke Petersen.\n\nNew method makes fava powder that bursts with protein\n\nTo find an alternative to environmentally taxing soybean, the study's researchers tested various crops, looking for those with the greatest potential as a protein powder, while also being able to be grown locally. Here, fava beans outperformed lentils, amaranth, buckwheat and quinoa.\n\nUsing an incredibly unique method known as 'wet fractionation', the researchers succeeded in concentrating fava bean protein and removing substances that would otherwise inhibit the digestion of the protein. This allows nutritious fava bean proteins to be more readily absorbed when consumed.\n\n\"Wet fractionation is accomplished by milling beans into a flour, and then adding water and blending the mixture into a soup. Thereafter, it becomes easier for us to sort out the less beneficial substances and produce an optimized product,\" explains Iben Lykke Petersen.

Its orbit is shaped like a rosette and not like an ellipse as predicted by Newton's theory of gravity. This long-sought-after result was made possible by increasingly precise measurements over nearly 30 years, which have enabled scientists to unlock the mysteries of the behemoth lurking at the heart of our galaxy.\n\n\"Einstein's General Relativity predicts that bound orbits of one object around another are not closed, as in Newtonian Gravity, but precess forwards in the plane of motion. This famous effect -- first seen in the orbit of the planet Mercury around the Sun -- was the first evidence in favour of General Relativity. One hundred years later we have now detected the same effect in the motion of a star orbiting the compact radio source Sagittarius A* at the centre of the Milky Way. This observational breakthrough strengthens the evidence that Sagittarius A* must be a supermassive black hole of 4 million times the mass of the Sun,\" says Reinhard Genzel, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Garching, Germany and the architect of the 30-year-long programme that led to this result.\n\nLocated 26,000 light-years from the Sun, Sagittarius A* and the dense cluster of stars around it provide a unique laboratory for testing physics in an otherwise unexplored and extreme regime of gravity. One of these stars, S2, sweeps in towards the supermassive black hole to a closest distance less than 20 billion kilometres (one hundred and twenty times the distance between the Sun and Earth), making it one of the closest stars ever found in orbit around the massive giant. At its closest approach to the black hole, S2 is hurtling through space at almost three percent of the speed of light, completing an orbit once every 16 years. \"After following the star in its orbit for over two and a half decades, our exquisite measurements robustly detect S2's Schwarzschild precession in its path around Sagittarius A*,\" says Stefan Gillessen of the MPE, who led the analysis of the measurements published today in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\nMost stars and planets have a non-circular orbit and therefore move closer to and further away from the object they are rotating around. S2's orbit precesses, meaning that the location of its closest point to the supermassive black hole changes with each turn, such that the next orbit is rotated with regard to the previous one, creating a rosette shape. General Relativity provides a precise prediction of how much its orbit changes and the latest measurements from this research exactly match the theory. This effect, known as Schwarzschild precession, had never before been measured for a star around a supermassive black hole.\n\nThe study with ESO's VLT also helps scientists learn more about the vicinity of the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy. \"Because the S2 measurements follow General Relativity so well, we can set stringent limits on how much invisible material, such as distributed dark matter or possible smaller black holes, is present around Sagittarius A*. This is of great interest for understanding the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes,\" say Guy Perrin and Karine Perraut, the French lead scientists of the project.\n\nThis result is the culmination of 27 years of observations of the S2 star using, for the best part of this time, a fleet of instruments at ESO's VLT, located in the Atacama Desert in Chile. The number of data points marking the star's position and velocity attests to the thoroughness and accuracy of the new research: the team made over 330 measurements in total, using the GRAVITY, SINFONI and NACO instruments. Because S2 takes years to orbit the supermassive black hole, it was crucial to follow the star for close to three decades, to unravel the intricacies of its orbital movement.\n\nThe research was conducted by an international team led by Frank Eisenhauer of the MPE with collaborators from France, Portugal, Germany and ESO. The team make up the GRAVITY collaboration, named after the instrument they developed for the VLT Interferometer, which combines the light of all four 8-metre VLT telescopes into a super-telescope (with a resolution equivalent to that of a telescope 130 metres in diameter). The[ same team reported in 2018] -- another effect predicted by General Relativity: they saw the light received from S2 being stretched to longer wavelengths as the star passed close to Sagittarius A*. \"Our previous result has shown that the light emitted from the star experiences General Relativity. Now we have shown that the star itself senses the effects of General Relativity,\" says Paulo Garcia, a researcher at Portugal's Centre for Astrophysics and Gravitation and one of the lead scientists of the GRAVITY project.\n\nWith ESO's upcoming Extremely Large Telescope, the team believes that they would be able to see much fainter stars orbiting even closer to the supermassive black hole. \"If we are lucky, we might capture stars close enough that they actually feel the rotation, the spin, of the black hole,\" says Andreas Eckart from Cologne University, another of the lead scientists of the project. This would mean astronomers would be able to measure the two quantities, spin and mass, that characterise Sagittarius A* and define space and time around it. \"That would be again a completely different level of testing relativity,\" says Eckart.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200416072633.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T11:26:33", "title": "Parasite carried by grey squirrels negatively impacts red squirrel behavior", "text": "Research published in the Journal of Animal Ecology reveals a new mechanism of how grey squirrels affect native red squirrels in Europe through parasite-mediated competition.\n\nAn international team from universities in Italy and Belgium used a natural experiment of populations of native red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) co-inhabiting with alien grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) to investigate the impact of a parasitic helminth (worm) transmitted by grey squirrels, Strongyloides robustus, on naive red squirrels' personality.\n\nBy comparing repeated measurements of red squirrel parasite infection and personality with those taken in sites where only the native species occurred, they demonstrated that infection by the alien parasite causes a significant reduction in red squirrels' activity and alters their relationship with native parasites.\n\nRed squirrels normally carry only one species of gastro-intestinal helminth (Trypanoxyuris sciuri) that co-evolved with this arboreal mammal; therefore they might be sensitive to parasite spillover, the acquisition of new parasite species transmitted by another host, in this case the alien grey squirrel. Grey squirrels in Italy commonly harbour Strongyloides robustus, a helminth introduced from their native range, which they transmit to native red squirrel.\n\nIn their study, Dr. Francesca Santicchia and her co-authors found negative correlations between activity of red squirrels and infection with the alien parasite S. robustus in the sites invaded by grey squirrels. Activity was also negatively correlated with infection by its native helminth (T. sciuri) but only when grey squirrels were present, thus, not in the red-only sites. Moreover, individuals that acquired S. robustus during the study reduced their activity after infection, while this was not the case for animals that remained uninfected.\n\nTheir findings, which show that parasite-mediated competition is energetically costly and can also alter the \"normal\" relationships between native host and native parasite, are published today in the Journal of Animal Ecology. This new paper comes two years after the researchers previous discovery that grey squirrels cause an increase in the concentration of stress hormones in co-occurring red squirrels, published in the same journal.\n\n\"That our red squirrel is threatened with extinction due to the introduction of an 'alien' species, the North American grey squirrel, has become common knowledge,\" say Dr. Francesca Santicchia and Dr. Lucas Wauters of the Guido Tosi Research Group at the University of Insubria in Italy. \"But that one of the mechanisms involved is the reduction of activity, a personality trait that tends to be related to foraging intensity or efficiency, caused by the spillover of a parasitic helminth from grey squirrels is a new finding.\"\n\n\"This spillover is very similar to what occurs with the Squirrel Poxvirus in the UK and Ireland,\" add Dr. Claudia Romeo and Dr. Nicola Ferrari from the University of Milano, \"although in this case of spillover of an endoparasite, the effect is much more subtle and does not lead directly to the death of the animal\"\n\n\"For red squirrels, the 'natural' situation is being the only diurnal tree-dwelling mammal in our forests and woodlands,\" explain Dr. Lucas Wauters and Prof. Adriano Martinoli, also with the University of Insubria. \"But when an alien species, such as the grey squirrel, colonizes these habitats, it acts as a true environmental stressor and carrier of potentially dangerous parasites.\"\n\nIn this study, the researchers produced compelling evidence that indicate that spillover of the alien helminth to naive red squirrels causes not only a reduction in activity, a behaviour that requires high energy expenditure, but also alters the relationships between red squirrels and their native, common helminth, T. sciuri.\n\n\"This is a subtle form of parasite-mediated competition, which may exacerbate the effects of interspecific competition with grey squirrels for food, such as conifer seeds, hazelnuts, or chestnuts,\" underline Wauters and Romeo.\n\nIn fact, reduced activity could result in lower food intake and together with chronically increased concentrations of glucocorticoids can produce a reduction in body growth or reproductive success, or even decrease survival, among the red squirrels that are forced to share their habitat with the invaders. The combination of these interacting ecological and physiological processes will lead to the extinction of the red squirrel population in few years' time.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415200520.htm", "published": "2020-04-16T00:05:20", "title": "Aspirin linked to reduction in risk of several cancers of the digestive tract", "text": "Aspirin is associated with a reduction in the risk of developing several cancers of the digestive tract, including some that are almost invariably fatal, such as pancreatic and liver cancers.\n\nThe largest and most comprehensive analysis to date of the link between aspirin and digestive tract cancers, published in the leading cancer journal Annals of Oncology [1] today (Thursday), found reductions in the risk of these cancers of between 22% and 38%.\n\nAspirin has been linked to a reduction in the risk of bowel cancer for some time, and other, smaller analyses have found associations with cancers of the esophagus (the food pipe or gullet) and stomach.\n\nThis analysis looked at evidence from 113 observational studies investigating cancers in the general population published up to 2019, of which 45 studies were on bowel cancer and included 156,000 cases. In addition to bowel cancer, the cancers investigated included those of the head and neck, esophagus, stomach, the part of the stomach that connects to the esophagus (gastric cardia), liver, gallbladder and bile ducts (hepato-biliary) and pancreas.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr Cristina Bosetti (PhD), head of the Unit of Cancer Epidemiology at the Mario Negri Department of Oncology, Milan (Italy), found that regular use of aspirin, defined as taking at least one or two tablets a week, was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing all these cancers, apart from head and neck cancer.\n\nSpecifically, aspirin use was linked to 27% reduced risk of bowel cancer (45 studies), 33% reduced risk of esophageal cancer (13 studies), 39% reduced risk of gastric cardia (ten studies), 36% reduced risk of stomach cancer (14 studies), 38% reduced risk of hepato-biliary cancers (five studies), and 22% reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (15 studies). Ten studies of head and neck cancer did not show a significant reduction in risk.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe senior author of the paper, Carlo La Vecchia (MD), Professor of Epidemiology at the School of Medicine, University of Milan, said: \"There are about 175,000 deaths from bowel cancer predicted for 2020 in the EU, of which about 100,000 will be in people aged between 50 and 74. If we assume that regular use of aspirin increases from 25% to 50% in this age group, this would mean that between 5,000 to 7,000 deaths from bowel cancer and between 12,000 and 18,000 new cases could be avoided if further studies show that aspirin does indeed cause the reduction in cancer risk.\n\n\"Corresponding figures would be approximately 3,000 deaths each for esophageal, stomach and pancreatic cancer, and 2,000 deaths from cancer of the liver. Given the unfavourable prognoses for these cancers, the number of new cases would be only slightly greater.\"\n\nThe researchers also analysed the effect of aspirin dose and duration on bowel cancer. They looked at low dose (100mg), regular (325mg) and high dose (500mg), combined with how many times a day, week or month it was taken.\n\nDr Bosetti said: \"We found that the risk of cancer was reduced with increased dose; an aspirin dose between 75 and 100mg a day was associated with a 10% reduction in a person's risk of developing cancer compared to people not taking aspirin; a dose of 325mg a day was associated with a 35% reduction, and a dose of 500mg a day was associated with a 50% reduction in risk. However, the estimate for high dose aspirin was based on just a few studies and should be interpreted cautiously.\n\n\"Our findings on bowel cancer support the concept that higher aspirin doses are associated with a larger reduction in risk of the disease. However, the choice of dose should also take into consideration the potential risk of stomach bleeds, which increases with higher aspirin doses.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Compared to people who did not take aspirin regularly, the risk of bowel cancer declined in regular aspirin users up to ten years. The risk was reduced by 4% after one year, 11% after three years, 19% after five years and 29% after ten years.\"\n\nProf Carlo La Vecchia said: \"These findings suggest there's a beneficial effect of aspirin in the prevention of bowel and other cancers of the digestive tract. The results for bowel, esophageal and pancreatic cancers are consistent with evidence from clinical trials on aspirin in the prevention of heart and blood vessel diseases.\n\n\"The findings for pancreatic and other digestive tract cancers may have implications for the prevention of these highly lethal diseases. For pancreatic cancer, we found that risk of the disease declined by 25% after five years among people who took aspirin regularly compared to those who did not.\n\n\"Taking aspirin for the prevention of bowel cancer, or any other cancers, should only be done in consultation with a doctor, who can take account of the person's individual risk. This includes factors such as sex, age, a family history of a first-degree relative with the disease, and other risk factors. People who are at high risk of the disease are most likely to gain the greatest benefits from aspirin.\"\n\nIn addition to stomach bleeds, the side effects of aspirin include bleeding in other parts of the body and, occasionally, haemorrhages.\n\nAs the study is based on observational studies, it can only show that aspirin is associated with a reduced risk, and biases or confounding factors may partly explain its results. Other limitations include the fact that in some studies information may not reflect changes in aspirin use over time; the people in the studies might not remember or report their aspirin use accurately; and most studies did not have data on other medications that might affect the association between aspirin and the risk of cancer.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415185837.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T22:58:37", "title": "Obesity is a critical risk factor for type 2 diabetes, regardless of genetics", "text": "Obesity increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by at least 6 times, regardless of genetic predisposition to the disease, concludes research published in Diabetologia (the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [EASD]).

The study sample included 4,729 individuals who developed type 2 diabetes during a median 14.7 years of follow-up, and a randomly selected cohort sample of 5,402 individuals (the control group).\n\nThe mean age of all participants was 56.1 years (range 50-65) and 49.6% were women. Overall, 21.8% of all participants were classified as obese, 43.0% as overweight and 35.2% as having normal weight; and 40.0% of the participants had a favourable lifestyle, 34.6% had an intermediate lifestyle and 25.4% had an unfavourable lifestyle.\n\nGenetic predisposition was quantified using a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising 193 known type 2 diabetes-associated genetic variants and divided into 5 risk groups of 20% each (quintiles), from lowest (quintile 1) to highest (quintile 5) genetic risk. Lifestyle was assessed by a lifestyle score composed of smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and diet. Statistical modelling was used to calculate the individual and combined associations of the GRS, obesity and lifestyle score with developing T2D.\n\nCompared with people of normal weight, those with obesity were almost six times more likely to develop T2D, while people who were overweight had a 2.4 times increased risk. For genetic risk, those with the highest GRS were twice as likely to develop T2D as those with the lowest, while those with the unhealthiest lifestyle were 18% more likely to develop T2D than those with the healthiest.\n\nIndividuals who ranked high for all three risk factors, with obesity, high GRS and unfavourable lifestyle, had a 14.5 times increased risk of developing T2D, compared with individuals who had a normal body weight, low GRS and favourable lifestyle. Notably, even among individuals with a low GRS and favourable lifestyle, obesity was associated with 8.4 times increased risk of T2D compared with normal weight individuals in the same genetic and lifestyle risk group.\n\nThe authors conclude: \"The results suggest that type 2 diabetes prevention by weight management and healthy lifestyle is critical across all genetic risk groups. Furthermore, we found that the effect of obesity on type 2 diabetes risk is dominant over other risk factors, highlighting the importance of weight management in type 2 diabetes prevention.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415171435.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T21:14:35", "title": "Low-cost imaging system poised to provide automatic mosquito tracking: Better monitoring could bring faster and more targeted control of mosquito-borne diseases", "text": "Mosquito-transmitted diseases such as malaria, dengue and yellow fever are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). A new low-cost imaging system could make it easier to track mosquito species that carry disease, enabling a more timely and targeted response.\n\n\"A remote system like ours can dramatically reduce the labor needed to monitor mosquitos in a given area, thus greatly increasing the capability to do more monitoring,\" said research team leader Adam Goodwin from Johns Hopkins University, USA. \"If you can provide more mosquito data, then you will more quickly catch outbreaks and save more lives.\"\n\nIn The Optical Society (OSA) journal Biomedical Optics Express, Goodwin and colleagues' paper is part of a feature issue on Optical Technologies for Improving Healthcare in Low-Resource Settings. In the paper, they describe the new system, which is designed to transmit images from inside a mosquito trap that are detailed enough for entomologists to distinguish mosquito wing patterns and the color of scales, features that indicate whether a mosquito is a species that carries disease. This information can be used to plan interventions that work best against that species.\n\n\"The new system is a classic application of an internet of things (IoT) device,\" said Goodwin. \"It could eventually be paired with computer vision algorithms to automatically determine species and provide that information to public health systems.\"\n\nDeveloping a remote imaging trap\n\nIn the many areas of the world where mosquito-transmitted disease is problematic, understanding which mosquito species are present in what numbers requires continually trapping mosquitoes at multiple locations. A worker must then drive around a county or region to drop off and pick up hundreds of traps per week and bring the specimens back to the lab to be identified under a microscope.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Our new optical system can be placed inside a traditional mosquito trap to provide remote surveillance of the abundance, diversity and distribution of mosquito species,\" said Goodwin. \"Using imaging is particularly appealing because as long as image quality is high, several mosquitos could be identified from an image at once.\"\n\nWhen designing the system, the researchers focused on the ability to accurately identify Aedes aegypti mosquitos, which can spread Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. This invasive species is native to Africa but has established itself in many parts of the world, including North America, Europe and Asia. They say that same approach could be applied to other insects as long as there is a way to capture and reliably image it.\n\nUsing optics and camera sensors that are readily commercially available, the researchers optimized their optical setup to achieve a resolution that balanced the need to image many mosquitos at once with the ability to see enough details to identify the mosquito species.\n\n\"Our new system would be particularly useful in monitoring Aedes aegypti in hard to reach areas and at commercial ports of entry where invasive species can be brought from other countries,\" said Goodwin. \"It could also expand current surveillance operations for regions already monitoring local populations of Aedes aegypti.\"\n\nIn most cases, public health systems only need to determine if there are changes in the number or type of mosquitos from day to day or hour to hour, not minute to minute. This means a camera sensor would only need to be turned on a few times a day at most. This would keep the power consumption within the range feasible for an internet-connected device.\n\nTesting the system\n\nTo test the new system, the researchers compared entomologists' ability to classify specimens from a digital microscopy image and images from the remote imaging system. There was not a significant difference in their capabilities between the image types. Although the entomologists didn't perform well on species classification for either the microscopy images or the remote system images, they did very well on genus classification.\n\n\"Entomologists are not used to identifying specimens from an image because they normally have the specimen in person and manipulate it with tweezers under a microscope,\" said Goodwin. \"However, recent work using convolutional neural networks to classify mosquitos from an image does show promise.\"\n\nThe researchers plan to continue optimizing the remote trap and plan to integrate computer vision algorithms as well as internet-connectivity into the system. \"This would enable species information to be sent directly to the public health system for decision-making,\" said Goodwin. \"This is where we think the system will really shine.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415171431.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T21:14:31", "title": "Applying mathematics to accelerate predictions for capturing fusion energy", "text": "A key issue for scientists seeking to bring the fusion that powers the sun and stars to Earth is forecasting the performance of the volatile plasma that fuels fusion reactions. Making such predictions calls for considerable costly time on the world's fastest supercomputers. Now researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have borrowed a technique from applied mathematics to accelerate the process.\n\nThe technique combines the millisecond behavior of fusion plasmas into longer-term forecasts. By using it, \"we were able to demonstrate that accurate predictions of quantities such as plasma temperature profiles and heat fluxes could be achieved at a much reduced computational cost,\" said Ben Sturdevant, an applied mathematician at PPPL and lead author of a Physics of Plasmas paper(link is external) that reported the results.\n\nFusion combines light elements in the form of plasma -- the hot, charged state of matter composed of free electrons and atomic nuclei -- that generates massive amounts of energy. Scientists are working around the world to create and control fusion on Earth for a virtually inexhaustible supply of safe and clean power to generate electricity.\n\nSpeeding simulations\n\nSturdevant applied the mathematical technique to the high-performance XGCa plasma code developed by a team led by physicist C.S. Chang at PPPL. The application greatly speeded up simulations of the evolving temperature profile of ions orbiting around magnetic field lines modeled with gyrokinetics -- a widely used model that provides a detailed microscopic description of the behavior of plasma in strong magnetic fields. Also accelerated was modeling the collisions between orbiting particles that cause heat to leak from the plasma and reduce its performance.\n\nThe application was the first successful use of the technique, called \"equation-free projective integration,\" to model the evolution of the ion temperature as colliding particles escape from magnetic confinement. Equation free modeling aims to extract long-term macroscopic information from short-term microscopic simulations. The key was improving a critical aspect of the technique called a \"lifting operator\" to map the large-scale, or macroscopic, states of plasma behavior onto small-scale, or microscopic, ones.\n\nThe modification brought the detailed profile of the ion temperature into sharp relief. \"Rather than directly simulating the evolution over a long time-scale, this method uses a number of millisecond simulations to make predictions over a longer time-scale,\" Sturdevant said. \"The improved process reduced the computing time by a factor of four.\"\n\nThe results, based on tokamak simulations, are general and could be adapted for other magnetic fusion devices including stellarators and even for other scientific applications. \"This is an important step in being able to confidently predict performance in fusion energy devices from first-principles-based physics,\" Sturdevant said.\n\nExpanding the technique\n\nHe next plans to consider the effect of expanding the technique to include the evolution of turbulence on the speed of the process. \"Some of these initial results are promising and exciting,\" Sturdevant said. \"We're very interested to see how it will work with the inclusion of turbulence.\"\n\nCoauthors of the paper include Chang, PPPL physicist Robert Hager and physicist Scott Parker of the University of Colorado.

Despite the common belief that cats are happy being left alone for long periods of time, recent studies in cats and their owners suggest that pet cats are social and develop bonds with their owners.\n\nIn order to assess separation-related problems in cats, de Souza Machado and colleagues developed a questionnaire for use with cat owners. Based on surveys in similar studies with dogs, the questionnaire asked owners to provide basic information on each cat; describe whether their cat displayed certain behaviors when the owner was absent; and describe themselves and their cat interactions, as well as the cat's living environment. The questionnaire was given to 130 owners of adult cats living in the city of Juiz de Fora in Minas Gerais, Brazil, for a total of 223 completed questionnaires (one per cat).\n\nAfter assessing and categorizing responses for each category, the authors statistically analyzed their results. The data showed 13.5 percent of the sampled cats (30 out of 223) met at least one of the criteria for separation-related problems, with destructive behaviour most frequently-reported (present in 20 of the 30 cats). The other behaviors or mental states identified were: excessive vocalization (19 out of 30 cats), inappropriate urination (18 cats), depression-apathy (16 cats), aggressiveness (11 cats), agitation-anxiety (11 cats) and inappropriate defecation (7 cats). The data also showed these cats were associated with households with no female residents, households with owners aged 18 to 35 years, and/or households with at least two female residents, as well as with not having access to toys (P=0.04) and/or having no other animal in the house (P=0.04).\n\nThis questionnaire still requires further validation based on direct observation of cat behavior. It's also limited by a reliance on owners being able to accurately interpret and report their cats' actions in their absence (for instance, scratching on surfaces is normal in cats, though some owners may consider it destructive).\n\nAlthough there's more work to be done elucidating the relationship between humans and pet cats, this questionnaire can act as a starting point for future research, in addition to indicating certain environmental factors (like toys) that could help cats with separation issues.\n\nThe authors add: \"This study provides information about behavioral signs consistent with separation-related problems (SRP) in a sampled population of domestic cats, as well as about the management practices used by their owners.

Their research appears April 15 in PLOS One, a journal published by the Public Library of Science.\n\n\"While having children makes people focus more on the future and, presumably, care more about the environment, our study suggests that parenthood does not cause people to become 'greener,'\" Shogren and Thunstrom say. \"In fact, the difference in CO2 emissions between parents and non-parents is substantial, and that's primarily because of increased transportation and food consumption changes.\"\n\nThe study involved an analysis of expenditures on goods and services by households in Sweden. The researchers found that parents with children at home consume goods and services that emit CO2 in the areas of food, such as meat, and transportation, such as gasoline, at higher rates than childless households.\n\nThe economists note that time constraints become more binding, and convenience may become more important, when people have children.\n\n\"Parents may need to be in more places in one day,\" resulting in people driving themselves instead of using public transportation or bicycling, the researchers wrote. \"They also need to feed more people. Eating more pre-prepared, red meat carbon-intensive meals may add convenience and save time.\"\n\nThe disparity in the carbon footprints of Swedish households with and without children is particularly striking, as concerns about climate change are more pronounced in Sweden than most other developed countries. Most Swedes believe climate change is real and have accepted sizable CO2 taxes, and households with children are subsidized, which helps to alleviate some of the time crunch for parents. Sweden has generous parental leave and subsidized day care, and parents have a legal right to reduced work hours.\n\n\"If we're finding these results in Sweden, it's pretty safe to assume that the disparity in carbon footprints between parents and nonparents is even bigger in most other Western countries,\" Thunstrom says -- though she notes that Sweden also has one of the world's highest female labor participation rates, which may add to the time constraints of household with children.\n\n\"Becoming a parent can transform a person -- he or she thinks more about the future and worries about future risks imposed on their children and progeny,\" Shogren says. \"But, while having children might be transformational, our results suggest that parents' concerns about climate change do not cause them to be 'greener' than non-parent adults.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415152917.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T19:29:17", "title": "Antiviral drug baloxavir reduces transmission of flu virus among ferrets", "text": "Baloxavir treatment reduced transmission of the flu virus from infected ferrets to healthy ferrets, suggesting that the antiviral drug could contribute to the early control of influenza outbreaks by limiting community-based viral spread, according to a study published April 15 in the open-access journal PLOS Pathogens by Aeron Hurt of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Wendy Barclay of Imperial College London, and colleagues. As noted by the authors, this is the first evidence that the rapid reduction in infectious viral particles associated with baloxavir treatment translates into a reduced risk of transmitting influenza to exposed contacts.\n\nInfluenza viruses cause seasonal outbreaks and pose a continuous pandemic threat. Although vaccines are available for influenza control, their efficacy varies each season and a vaccine for a novel pandemic virus manufactured using current technology will not be available fast enough to mitigate the effect of the first pandemic wave. Antivirals can be effective against many different influenza viruses, but have not been used extensively for outbreak control. A recently licensed antiviral drug called baloxavir has been shown to reduce the amount of virus particles produced by infected people more effectively than the widely used drug oseltamivir. In the new study, the researchers tested whether baloxavir treatment might also interrupt onward virus transmission.\n\nThey found that baloxavir treatment reduced infectious viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza viruses compared to placebo, and reduced the frequency of transmission, even when treatment was delayed until two days after infection. By contrast, oseltamivir treatment did not substantially affect viral shedding or transmission compared to placebo. Importantly, the researchers did not detect the emergence of baloxavir-resistant variants in the animals. The results support the idea that antivirals which decrease viral shedding could also reduce influenza transmission in the community. According to the authors, such an effect has the potential to dramatically change how we manage influenza outbreaks, including pandemic influenza.\n\nThe authors add, \"Our study shows that baloxavir can have a dual effect in influenza: a single dose reduces the symptoms and reduces the risk of passing it on to others as well.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415152915.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T19:29:15", "title": "Bile metabolite of gut microbes boosts immune cells", "text": "A Ludwig Cancer Research study has discovered a novel means by which bacterial colonies in the small intestine support the generation of regulatory T cells -- immune cells that suppress autoimmune reactions and inflammation. The study, led by Ludwig MSK Director Alexander Rudensky and published in Nature, demonstrates that a microbial metabolite -- the organic acid isoDCA -- boosts the local generation of the immunosuppressive immune cells in the colon. Such locally generated, or \"peripheral,\" regulatory T cells (Tregs) help dampen chronic intestinal inflammation, a major driver of colorectal cancers.\n\nThough the study does not directly address cancer prevention, its findings have intriguing implications for the field -- which is why the study was funded in part by the colon cancer prevention and early detection initiative launched in 2015 by Ludwig and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.\n\n\"People have been thinking about using commensal microbes to treat inflammatory disorders of the colon,\" says Rudensky. \"One approach is to develop a new class of drugs made from defined consortia of microbes that would limit inflammation and promote colonic health, reducing the risk of colon cancer in people. Bacterial consortia that produce isoDCA and other metabolites that promote anti-inflammatory activity in colon-resident immune cells could be one of the components of such interventions.\"\n\nGut microbes, which are critical to digestion and metabolism, also support many other important processes ranging from immune regulation to brain development. An authority on Tregs, Rudensky has long explored the cross-talk between commensal bacteria and Tregs, which primarily mature in the thymus but can also be induced from precursor T cells in other tissues, especially the intestines. These peripheral Tregs, he has shown, shield beneficial gut microbes from immune attack and suppress chronic intestinal inflammation.\n\n\"There are two-way communications between the host and its commensal microbial community, where the host must be informed of the composition of that community and respond to that information,\" says Rudensky. \"This implies that a likely means of communication between the microbial community and the host immune system would be through the metabolic products of commensal bacteria, since metabolic support is among the main services commensal microbes provide to their hosts.\"\n\nAbout 5% of the bile pumped into the intestines to help digest fat is retained in the organ, and some of it is metabolized by commensal bacteria. Rudensky and his colleagues were curious about whether the byproducts of that metabolism influence the local immune environment. To find out, they screened a spectrum of bile acids produced by bacterial metabolism for such effects in co-cultures of the precursor T cells from which Tregs arise and dendritic cells, which help direct the generation of Tregs.\n\nThe screen revealed that two products of bacterial bile metabolism -- ?-MCA and isoDCA -- significantly boosted the conversion of precursor T cells into peripheral Tregs. Focusing on isoDCA, which is more abundant in the human intestine, Rudensky and his colleagues found that the bile acid exerted its effects not on the precursor T cells, but on dendritic cells.\n\nIsoDCA, they found, opposes the signals issued by a bile acid sensor in dendritic cells, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). This hushes the dendritic cells' expression of genes that induce protective immune responses, pushing them into an anti-inflammatory state in which they drive the generation of peripheral Tregs.\n\nRudensky and his colleagues next conducted elegant synthetic biology experiments in mouse models to confirm the biological veracity of their findings. The results reflected those obtained in cell culture. Mice colonized with bacteria engineered to make isoDCA had many more peripheral Tregs in their intestines than those colonized with the same bacteria lacking the capability. The same results were obtained using two other similarly engineered species of gut bacteria.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415152913.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T19:29:13", "title": "Biomechanics of skin can perform useful tactile computations", "text": "As our body's largest and most prominent organ, the skin also provides one of our most fundamental connections to the world around us. From the moment we're born, it is intimately involved in every physical interaction we have.\n\nThough scientists have studied the sense of touch, or haptics, for more than a century, many aspects of how it works remain a mystery.\n\n\"The sense of touch is not fully understood, even though it is at the heart of our ability to interact with the world,\" said UC Santa Barbara haptics researcher Yon Visell. \"Anything we do with our hands -- picking up a glass, signing our name or finding keys in our bag -- none of that is possible without the sense of touch. Yet we don't fully understand the nature of the sensations captured by the skin or how they are processed in order to enable perception and action.\"\n\nWe have better models for how our other senses, such as vision and hearing, work, but our understanding of how the sense of touch works is much less complete, he added.\n\nTo help fill that gap, Visell and his research team, including Yitian Shao and collaborator Vincent Hayward at the Sorbonne, have been studying the physics of touch sensation -- how touching an object gives rise to signals in the skin that shape what we feel. In a study (link) published in the journal Science Advances, the group reveals how the intrinsic elasticity of the skin aids tactile sensing. Remarkably, they show that far from being a simple sensing material, the skin can also aid the processing of tactile information.\n\nTo understand this significant but little-known aspect of touch, Visell thinks it is helpful to think about how the eye, our visual organ, processes optical information.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Human vision relies on the optics of the eye to focus light into an image on the retina,\" he said. \"The retina contains light-sensitive receptors that translate this image into information that our brain uses to decompose and interpret what we're looking at.\"\n\nAn analogous process unfolds when we touch a surface with our skin, Visell continued. Similar to the structures such as the cornea and iris that capture and focus light onto the retina, the skin's elasticity distributes tactile signals to sensory receptors throughout the skin.\n\nBuilding on previous work which used an array of tiny accelerometers worn on the hand to sense and catalog the spatial patterns of vibrations generated by actions such as tapping, sliding or grasping, the researchers here employed a similar approach to capture spatial patterns of vibration that are generated as the hand feels the environment.\n\n\"We used a custom device consisting of 30 three-axis sensors gently bonded to the skin,\" explained lead author Shao. \"And then we asked each participant in our experiments to perform many different touch interactions with their hands.\" The research team collected a dataset of nearly 5000 such interactions, and analyzed that data to interpret how the transmission of touch-produced vibration patterns that were transmitted throughout the hand shaped information content in the tactile signals. The vibration patterns arose from the elastic coupling within the skin itself.\n\nThe team then analyzed these patterns in order to clarify how the transmission of vibrations in the hand shaped information in the tactile signals. \"We used a mathematical model in which high-dimensional signals felt throughout the hand were represented as combinations of a small number of primitive patterns,\" Shao explained. The primitive patterns provided a compact lexicon, or dictionary, that compressed the size of the information in the signals, enabling them to be encoded more efficiently.\n\nThis analysis generated a dozen or fewer primitive wave patterns -- vibrations of the skin throughout the hand that could be used to capture information in the tactile signals felt by the hand. The striking feature of these primitive vibration patterns, Visell said, is that they automatically reflected the structure of the hand and the physics of wave transmission in the skin.\n\n\"Elasticity plays this very basic function in the skin of engaging thousands of sensory receptors for touch in the skin, even when contact occurs at a small skin area,\" he explained. \"This allows us to use far more sensory resources than would otherwise be available to interpret what it is that we're touching.\" The remarkable finding of their research is that this process also makes it possible to more efficiently capture information in the tactile signals, Visell said. Information processing of this kind is normally considered to be performed by the brain, rather than the skin.\n\nThe role played by mechanical transmission in the skin is in some respects similar to the role of the mechanics of the inner ear in hearing, Visell said. In 1961, von Bekesy received the Nobel Prize for his work showing how the mechanics of the inner ear facilitate auditory processing. By spreading sounds with different frequency content to different sensory receptors in the ear they aid the encoding of sounds by the auditory system. The team's work suggests that similar processes may underly the sense of touch.\n\nThese findings, according to the researchers, not only contribute to our understanding of the brain, but may also suggest new approaches for the engineering of future prosthetic limbs for amputees that might be endowed with skin-like elastic materials. Similar methods also could one day be used to improve tactile sensing by next-generation robots.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415133707.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T17:37:07", "title": "Mahogany tree family dates back to last hurrah of the dinosaurs", "text": "You might own something made from mahogany like furniture, paneling or a musical instrument.\n\nMahogany is a commercially important wood, valued for its hardness and beauty. The United States is the world's top importer of the tropical timber from leading producers like Peru and Brazil. Unfortunately, mahogany is harvested illegally a lot of the time.\n\nFor science, mahogany is important, too -- the fossil presence of the mahogany family is a telltale of where tropical forests once stood. Until recently, paleobotanists had only found evidence the mahogany family extended back to the Paleocene (about 60 million years ago).\n\nNow, a new paper written by University of Kansas researcher Brian Atkinson in the American Journal of Botany shows the mahogany family goes back millions of years more, to the last hurrah of the dinosaurs, the Cretaceous.\n\n\"For understanding when many of the different branches of the tree of life evolved, we're primarily dependent on the fossil record,\" said Atkinson, an assistant professor of ecology & evolutionary biology and curator in the Biodiversity Institute's Division of Paleobotany. \"In this case, Meliaceae, the mahogany family, is an ecologically and economically important group of trees. A lot of researchers have used this group as a study system to better understand the evolution of tropical rainforests. This work is the first definitive evidence that the tropically important trees were around during the Cretaceous period, when we first start to see the modernization of ecosystems and modern groups of plants.\"\n\nAtkinson's new work pushes back the fossil record for Meliaceae by 15 to 20 million years, the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, from between 72-79 million years ago. The well-preserved mahogany specimen Atkinson analyzed was discovered just off Vancouver Island in Canada.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"The rock that contained the specimen was collected by a local fossil collector, Graham Beard, who is the director of the Qualicum Beach Museum of Natural History,\" Atkinson said. \"He collected it years ago, but I was actually interested in the rock that has this fossil in it for something else. And as I kept preparing this rock, more for the other fossils were in there, this thing showed up by surprise. So, it was kind of found by accident.\"\n\nTo pinpoint the fossil's identity, Atkinson carefully studied the structure of the fossilized fruit and also analyzed phylogenetic information to figure out its relationship to other species in the mahogany family.\n\n\"I combined the molecular data from living representatives of the mahogany family with the morphology of the fossil, as well as the morphology of living species,\" he said. \"And then I subjugated that combined dataset to phylogenetic analyses, which allows us to reconstruct evolutionary relationships. Based on this analysis, we found the fossil is closely related to this genus called Melia, which is living today.\"\n\nThe KU researcher gave the oldest-known mahogany fossil the scientific name Manchestercarpa vancouverensis -- the species name signifies where the specimen was discovered, and the genus is named after an esteemed colleague in the field.\n\n\"I named it after a prolific paleobotanist who's really improved our understanding of the evolution of flowering plants through the fossil record,\" Atkinson said. \"So, I named it in honor of Steve Manchester, who's at the University of Florida Museum of Natural History.\"\n\nWhile it's noteworthy that Atkinson has pushed back the origin story of mahogany, he stressed it also helps improve our understanding of the rate of early flowering plant evolution and, in turn, our grasp of larger modern ecosystems.\n\n\"They're our most diverse group of plants on Earth, and so there's a whole lot to explore,\" he said. \"And there are some cool things you can do methodologically that you might not be able to do with other groups of plants.

They achieved this with use of a highly specialized diamond anvil which compresses samples, and sophisticated X-ray measurements. Their findings confirm the molten outer core is less dense than liquid iron and also put values on the discrepancy.\n\nJules Verne's 1864 novel Journey to the Center of the Earth takes explorers on an imaginative trip down to the Earth's core where they find a gargantuan hollow cavern hosting a prehistoric environment, and dinosaurs. They get there thanks to a tanklike drilling machine which navigates through volcanoes. It sounds fun, but needless to say, it's a far cry from reality, where researchers explore the inner Earth with a range of techniques and instruments from the comparative safety of the Earth's surface.\n\nSeismic apparatus which measure how earthquakes travel through the planet are pivotal to map some of the larger structural arrangements within the Earth, and thanks to this it has long been known that at the heart of the Earth lies a solid core surrounded by a less dense liquid outer core. For the first time, experiments and simulations have shown researchers details about this outer core which were previously unobtainable. And these experiments include some fascinating details.\n\n\"Recreating conditions found at the center of the Earth up here on the surface is not easy,\" remarked Project Assistant Professor Yasuhiro Kuwayama from the Department of Earth and Planetary Science. \"We used a diamond anvil to compress a sample of liquid iron subject to intense heat. But more than just creating the conditions, we needed to maintain them long enough to take our measurements. This was the real challenge.\"\n\nIt is harder to measure the density of a liquid sample than a solid one as it takes the apparatus longer to do so. But with a unique experimental set up crafted over two decades, centered around the diamond anvil, Kuwayama and his team maintained their sample sufficiently to collect the data they required. They used a highly focused X-ray source from the SPring-8 synchrotron in Japan to probe the sample and measure its density.\n\n\"We found the density of liquid iron such as you'd find in the outer core to be about 10 tons per cubic meter at a pressure of 116 gigapascals, and the temperature to be 4,350 Kelvin,\" explained Kuwayama. \"For reference, typical room temperature is about 273 Kelvin. So this sample is over 16 times hotter than your room, and 10 times denser than water.\"\n\nWhen compared to this new measurement, the density of the Earth's outer core appears to be about 8 percent less dense than pure liquid iron. The suggestion here is that there are additional lighter elements in the molten outer core which are currently unidentified. This research could aid others in their quest to reveal more unobtainable secrets from deep within the Earth.\n\n\"It's important to investigate these things to understand more, not only about the Earth's core, but about the composition, and thus behavior, of other planets as well,\" concluded Kuwayama. \"It's important to note that it was not just elaborate equipment that helped us find this new information, but also meticulous mathematical modeling and analytical methods.

Scientists believe equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created at the beginning of the universe, but this would mean they should have wiped each other out, annihilating the universe as it began.\n\nInstead, physicists suggest there must be differences in the way matter and antimatter behave that explain why matter persisted and now dominates the universe. Each particle of matter has an antimatter equivalent, and neutrinos are no different, with an antimatter equivalent called antineutrinos.\n\nThey should be exact opposites in their properties and behaviour, which is what makes them annihilate each other on contact.\n\nNow, an international team of researchers that make up the T2K Collaboration, including Imperial College London scientists, have found the strongest evidence yet that neutrinos and antineutrinos behave differently, and therefore may not wipe each other out.\n\nDr Patrick Dunne, from the Department of Physics at Imperial, said: \"This result brings us closer than ever before to answering the fundamental question of why the matter in our universe exists. If confirmed -- at the moment we're over 95 per cent sure -- it will have profound implications for physics and should point the way to a better understanding of how our universe evolved.\"\n\nPreviously, scientists have found some differences in behaviour between matter and antimatter versions of subatomic particles called quarks, but the differences observed so far do not seem to be large enough to account for the dominance of matter in the universe.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, T2K's new result indicates that the differences in the behaviour of neutrinos and antineutrinos appear to be quite large. Neutrinos are fundamental particles but do not interact with normal matter very strongly, such that around 50 trillion neutrinos from the Sun pass through your body every second.\n\nNeutrinos and antineutrinos can come in three 'flavours', known as muon, electron and tau. As they travel, they can 'oscillate' -- changing into a different flavour. The fact that muon neutrinos oscillate into electron neutrinos was first discovered by the T2K experiment in 2013.\n\nTo get the new result, the team fired beams of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos from the J-PARC facility at Tokai, Japan, and detected how many electron neutrinos and antineutrinos arrived at the Super-Kamiokande detector 295km away.\n\nThey looked for differences in how the neutrinos or antineutrinos changed flavour, finding neutrinos appear to be much more likely to change than antineutrinos.\n\nThe available data also strongly discount the possibility that neutrinos and antineutrinos are as just likely as each other to change flavour. Dr Dunne said: \"What our result shows is that we're more than 95 per cent sure that matter neutrinos and antineutrinos behave differently. This is big news in itself; however we do already know of other particles that have matter-antimatter differences that are too small to explain our matter-dominated universe.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Therefore, measuring the size of the difference is what matters for determining whether neutrinos can answer this fundamental question. Our result today finds that unlike for other particles, the result in neutrinos is compatible with many of the theories explaining the origin of the universe's matter dominance.\"\n\nWhile the result is the strongest evidence yet that neutrinos and antineutrinos behave differently, the T2K Collaboration is working to reduce any uncertainties and gather more data by upgrading the detectors and beamlines, including the new Hyper-Kamiokande detector to replace the Super-Kamiokande. A new experiment, called DUNE, is also under construction in the US. Imperial is involved in both.\n\nImperial researchers have been involved in the T2K Collaboration since 2004, starting with conceptual designs on whiteboards and research and development on novel particle detector components that were key to building this experiment, which was finally completed and turned on in 2010.\n\nFor the latest result, the team contributed to the statistical analysis of the results and ensuring the signal they observe is real, as well as including the effects of how neutrinos interact with matter, which is one of the largest uncertainties that go into the analysis.\n\nProfessor Yoshi Uchida said: \"When we started, we knew that seeing signs of differences between neutrinos and antineutrinos in this way was something that could take decades, if they could ever be seen at all, so it is almost like a dream to have our result be celebrated on the cover of Nature this week.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415133655.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T17:36:55", "title": "Scientists fit two co-catalysts on one nanosheet for better water purification", "text": "A collaboration of scientists from the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) -- a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science user facility at DOE's Brookhaven National Laboratory -- Yale University, and Arizona State University has designed and tested a new two-dimensional (2-D) catalyst that can be used to improve water purification using hydrogen peroxide. While water treatment with hydrogen peroxide is environmentally friendly, the two-part chemical process that drives it is not very efficient. So far, scientists have struggled to improve the efficiency of the process through catalysis because each part of the reaction needs its own catalyst -- called a co-catalyst -- and the co-catalysts can't be next to each other.\n\n\"Our overarching goal is to develop a material that increases the efficiency of the process so that no additional chemical treatment of the water would be necessary. This would be particularly useful for systems that are off-the-grid and far away from urban centers,\" said Jaehong Kim, Henry P. Becton Sr. Professor of Engineering and Chair of Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at Yale University. Kim is also a member of Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Nanotechnology-Enabled Water Treatment (NEWT), which partly supported this research.\n\nIn their recent paper, published on March 11 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the team presented the design for the new 2-D catalyst and revealed its structure through measurements at NSLS-II. The trick of their new design is that the scientists managed to place two co-catalysts -- one for each part of the reaction -- onto two different locations on a thin nanosheet.\n\n\"Many processes need two reactions in one. This means that you need two co-catalysts. However, the challenge is that the two co-catalysts have to stay separated, otherwise they'll interact with each other and create a negative effect on the efficiency of the whole process,\" said Eli Stavitski, a chemist and beamline scientist at NSLS-II.\n\nIn many cases, catalysts are made from a large number of atoms to form a catalytic nanomaterial, which may seem small to a human but, in the world of chemical reactions, are still fairly large. Therefore, placing two of these materials next to each other without them interacting is quite challenging. To solve this challenge, the team took a different route.\n\n\"We used a thin nanosheet to co-host two co-catalysts for the different parts of the reaction. The beauty is in its simplicity: one of the co-catalysts -- a single cobalt (Co) atom -- sits in the center of the sheet, whereas the other one, a molecule called anthraquinone, is placed around the edges. This would not be possible with catalysts made of nanomaterials- since they would be 'too big' for this purpose,\" said Kim.\n\nadvertisement\n\nKim and his team at Yale synthesized this new 2-D catalyst in their lab following a precise series of chemical reactions, heating, and separating steps.\n\nAfter the scientists synthesized the new two-in-one catalyst, they needed to figure out if the co-catalysts would stay separated during an actual reaction and how well this new 2-D catalyst would perform. However, to really 'see' the atomic structure and chemical properties of their two-in-one catalyst in action, the scientists needed two different kinds of x-rays: hard x-rays and tender x-rays. Just like visible light, x-rays come in different colors -- or wavelengths -- and instead of calling them blue or red, they are called hard, tender, or soft.\n\n\"Human eyes cannot see ultraviolet or infrared light and we need special cameras to see them. Our instruments are not able to 'see' both hard and tender x-rays at the same time. So, we needed two different instruments -- or beamlines -- to investigate the catalyst's materials using different x-rays,\" said Stavitski.\n\nThe scientists started their investigation at NSLS-II's hard x-ray Inner Shell Spectroscopy (ISS) beamline using a technique called x-ray absorption spectroscopy. This technique helped the team to learn more about the local structure of the new 2-D catalyst. Specifically, they found out how many neighboring atoms each co-catalyst has, how far away these neighbors are, and how they are connected to each other.\n\nThe next stop in the investigation was NSLS-II's Tender Energy X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (TES) beamline.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"By using the same technique at TES with tender x-rays instead of hard x-rays, we could see the light elements clearly. Traditionally, many catalysts are made from heavy elements such as cobalt, nickel, or platinum, which we can study using hard x-rays, however our 2-D catalyst also includes important lighter elements such as phosphorous. So, to learn more about the role of this lighter element in our two-in-one catalyst, we also needed tender x-rays,\" said Yonghua Du, a physicist and TES beamline scientist.\n\nNSLS-II's TES beamline is a one of the few instruments within the U.S. that can complement the different hard x-ray capabilities by offering tender x-ray imaging and spectroscopic capabilities.\n\nAfter their experiments, the scientists wanted to be sure that they understood how the catalyst worked and decided to simulate different candidate structures and their properties.\n\n\"We used an approach called density functional theory to understand the structures and the mechanisms that controls the efficiency of the reaction. Based on what we learned through the experiments and what we know about how atoms interact with each other, we simulated several candidate structures to determine which one was most plausible,\" said Christopher Muhich, assistant professor of chemical engineering at Arizona State University and also a member of NEWT.\n\nOnly by combining their expertise in synthesis, analytical experimentation, and theoretical simulation could the team create their new 2-D catalyst and demonstrate its efficiency.

The scientists report that in their newly adopted immature state, the cells become capable of re-growing new connections that, under the right conditions, can help to restore lost function.\n\nRepairing damage to the brain and spinal cord may be medical science's most daunting challenge. Until relatively recently, it seemed an impossible task. The new study lays out a \"transcriptional roadmap of regeneration in the adult brain.\"\n\n\"Using the incredible tools of modern neuroscience, molecular genetics, virology and computational power, we were able for the first time to identify how the entire set of genes in an adult brain cell resets itself in order to regenerate. This gives us fundamental insight into how, at a transcriptional level, regeneration happens,\" said senior author Mark Tuszynski, MD, PhD, professor of neuroscience and director of the Translational Neuroscience Institute at UC San Diego School of Medicine.\n\nUsing a mouse model, Tuszynski and colleagues discovered that after injury, mature neurons in adult brains revert back to an embryonic state. \"Who would have thought,\" said Tuszynski. \"Only 20 years ago, we were thinking of the adult brain as static, terminally differentiated, fully established and immutable.\"\n\nBut work by Fred \"Rusty\" Gage, PhD, president and a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and an adjunct professor at UC San Diego, and others found that new brain cells are continually produced in the hippocampus and subventricular zone, replenishing these brain regions throughout life.\n\n\"Our work further radicalizes this concept,\" Tuszynski said. \"The brain's ability to repair or replace itself is not limited to just two areas. Instead, when an adult brain cell of the cortex is injured, it reverts (at a transcriptional level) to an embryonic cortical neuron. And in this reverted, far less mature state, it can now regrow axons if it is provided an environment to grow into. In my view, this is the most notable feature of the study and is downright shocking.\"\n\nTo provide an \"encouraging environment for regrowth,\" Tuszynski and colleagues investigated how damaged neurons respond after a spinal cord injury. In recent years, researchers have significantly advanced the possibility of using grafted neural stem cells to spur spinal cord injury repairs and restore lost function, essentially by inducing neurons to extend axons through and across an injury site, reconnecting severed nerves.\n\nLast year, for example, a multi-disciplinary team led by Kobi Koffler, PhD, assistant professor of neuroscience, Tuszynski, and Shaochen Chen, PhD, professor of nanoengineering and a faculty member in the Institute of Engineering in Medicine at UC San Diego, described using 3D printed implants to promote nerve cell growth in spinal cord injuries in rats, restoring connections and lost functions.\n\nThe latest study produced a second surprise: In promoting neuronal growth and repair, one of the essential genetic pathways involves the gene Huntingtin (HTT), which, when mutated, causes Huntington's disease, a devastating disorder characterized by the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain.\n\nTuszynski's team found that the \"regenerative transcriptome\" -- the collection of messenger RNA molecules used by corticospinal neurons -- is sustained by the HTT gene. In mice genetically engineered to lack the HTT gene, spinal cord injuries showed significantly less neuronal sprouting and regeneration.\n\n\"While a lot of work has been done on trying to understand why Huntingtin mutations cause disease, far less is understood about the normal role of Huntingtin,\" Tuszynski said. \"Our work shows that Huntingtin is essential for promoting repair of brain neurons. Thus, mutations in this gene would be predicted to result in a loss of the adult neuron to repair itself. This, in turn, might result in the slow neuronal degeneration that results in Huntington's disease.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415133650.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T17:36:50", "title": "Human handling stresses young monarch butterflies: Research shows the adult monarchs can better handle stressors", "text": "People handle monarch butterflies. A lot. Every year thousands of monarch butterflies are caught, tagged and released during their fall migration by citizen scientists helping to track their movements. And thousands of caterpillars are reared by hand or used in classroom demonstrations and outreach events.\n\nThese activities can provide valuable scientific data and educational benefits for the people participating in them. But how do the monarchs themselves feel about being handled by humans?\n\nThe answer, according to a new study from University of Georgia ecologist Andy Davis, depends on their life stage: Being handled is stressful to them but only in their early life.\n\n\"Most people don't realize that insects get stressed in much the same way as vertebrates do,\" said Davis, an assistant research scientist in the Odum School of Ecology. \"People handle monarchs for all of these activities, but if you imagine yourself in their place, what would it be like for us if a 50-foot-tall robot picked us up and passed us around? From the monarch's perspective, maybe for them this is akin to being attacked by a predator.\"\n\nStress reactions in insects include elevated heart rates, which are part of the fight-or-flight response triggered by predators -- or perceived predators -- so Davis designed a series of experiments to find out whether the heart rates of monarchs rose after handling.\n\nBecause they are subject to human contact at all life stages -- larval, pupal and adult -- he measured the heart rates of caterpillars, chrysalises and butterflies before and after short periods of gentle handling.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDavis first looked at caterpillars under a microscope, and counted how fast their hearts beat before handling. Then he gently passed the caterpillar from hand to hand for three minutes and observed its heart rate again.\n\nThe procedure was similar for adult butterflies, which Davis netted during fall migration. Within 30 seconds of catching each one, he held it carefully under a microscope to observe its heart beats. He then simulated the procedure for tagging them and measured their heart rates again.\n\nMeasuring the heart rates of monarch pupae required a different approach. Because they are encased in a chrysalis, their heart beats can't be observed under a microscope. Davis instead used an electronic device that could remotely detect heart movement inside the chrysalis and provide a readout to his computer.\n\nMaking the process even more complicated was the unusual cardiac function of monarch pupae.\n\n\"At the pupal stage, their hearts beat in a weird way,\" Davis said. \"The heart will beat for about 15 minutes and then stop for up to two hours; it flatlines.\"\n\nThe monarch heart also reacts very quickly to disturbance, so he gently prodded or jostled the chrysalises for 20 seconds and recorded their heart rates for the next minute using the electronic device.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe found that handling did indeed have an effect on heart rates at the two early stages of life. Caterpillars experienced an approximately 20% increase above their baseline heart rate, and pupal heart rates shot from zero to 88 beats per minute -- which is almost three times higher than the typical active beating rate for pupae as reported in earlier research.\n\nThe heart rates of adult butterflies, however, showed no significant change after handling. This could mean either that the experiment didn't capture the adult butterflies' stress reaction or that gentle handling doesn't cause them stress.\n\nDavis suspects it's the latter.\n\n\"It kind of makes sense that adult monarchs would be fairly stress-tolerant,\" he said. \"The migration itself is fraught with dangers and perils along the way, and for a monarch to be able to accomplish that, it has to be able to deal with a wide variety of natural stressors.\"\n\nDavis said that just because larvae and pupae seem prone to stress reactions from handling, the study shouldn't be interpreted to mean that people shouldn't work with monarchs.\n\n\"These results don't mean people should stop important activities like research and outreach,\" he said. \"But the results should at least make us more cognizant about how the monarch is feeling about being handled.

The Global Burden of Disease Study reports 251 million cases of COPD globally in 2016.\n\n\"It's a frustrating disease to care for. We can try and improve the symptoms, but we don't have anything that can cure the disease or prevent death,\" said UConn Health pulmonologist and critical care doctor Mark Metersky, who gathered the stem cells from lung fluid while performing bronchoscopies.\n\nDespite its accounting for more deaths than any single disease on the planet, relatively little has been written or understood about the root cause of COPD.\n\nOver the past decade, Xian and McKeon developed technology for cloning stem cells of the lungs and airways and have been at it since, noting that different parts of the airways give different stem cells, related but distinguishable.\n\n\"It's quite remarkable,\" said McKeon. \"In the deep lung, the distal airway stem cells gave rise to both the distal tubes and the alveoli and our research indicates those are the stem cells that make it possible for lungs to regenerate on their own.\" Xian and McKeon discovered lung regeneration in 2011 in their studies of subjects recovering from infections by an H1N1 influenza virus that was nearly identical to that which sparked the 1918 pandemic.\n\nXian and McKeon found that, in contrast to normal lungs, COPD lungs were inundated by three unusual variant lung stem cells that are committed to form metaplastic lesions known to inhabit COPD lungs, but seen by many as a secondary effect without a causal link to the pathology of COPD. After the team's postdoctoral fellow, Wei Rao, transplanted each of the COPD clones into immunodeficient subjects, the team found they not only gave rise to the distinct metaplastic lesions of COPD, but they separately triggered the triad of pathologies of COPD including mucus hypersecretion, fibrosis and chronic inflammation.\n\n\"The long-overlooked metaplastic lesions in COPD were, in fact, driving the disease rather than merely secondary consequences of the condition,\" said McKeon.\n\nNow that the team knows the identity of the cells that cause inflammation, fibrosis and small airway obstruction, they are hard at work screening them against libraries of drug-like molecules to discover new therapeutics.\n\n\"As we now know the specific cells responsible for COPD pathology, we can target them, much as we would cancer, with specific drugs that selectively kill them off and leave the normal cells to regenerate normal lung tissue,\" said Xian.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415133644.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T17:36:44", "title": "Researchers use snake venom to solve structure of muscle protein: Detail of nicotinic receptor involved in muscle contraction revealed through cryo-EM technology", "text": "Researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center have uncovered the detailed shape of a key protein involved in muscle contraction. The report, published today in Neuron, may lead to improved understanding of muscle-weakening genetic conditions called congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS).\n\nThe protein sits on the surface of nerve cells that connect to muscles and is integral to triggering the muscle cell to contract just milliseconds after instructions are sent through the spinal cord. Called a nicotinic receptor, it has been a challenge to study because it sits in the cell's membrane.\n\n\"The nicotinic receptor at the neuromuscular junction has been a target of interest for over a century. It was the first ion channel to be purified, the first to have its genes cloned, and the first to be imaged by an electron microscope,\" says Ryan Hibbs, Ph.D., associate professor of Neuroscience and Biophysics at UTSW and a corresponding author of the study.\n\nMany groups had tried to determine the receptor's structure using an earlier technology called X-ray crystallography as well as first generation cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM) but they were only able to obtain low-resolution images, he adds.\n\nNormally the nicotinic receptor is activated by a molecule called acetylcholine. However, the nicotinic receptor is also the target of various venoms that cause muscle paralysis.\n\nSo the team used this to their advantage to isolate enough of the receptor protein to study its shape and structure. They mixed the toxin from snake venom with fish tissue known to contain high amounts of the receptor protein.\n\nThe team then flash froze the receptor bound to the toxin and used the rapidly evolving technique of cryo-electron microscopy to uncover the shape of the structure. Before recent developments in cryo-EM, the only method by which to solve protein structures like the nicotinic receptor was X-ray crystallography, which involved slowly growing crystals of proteins. But proteins that sit in membranes usually do not crystallize well.\n\n\"This never could have been done using X-ray crystallography -- hundreds of researchers had attempted it. The new microscopes allowed us to get to a very high resolution near the atomic level. At that resolution, we can precisely make out the positions of most of more than 2,000 amino acids that make up the receptor protein,\" Hibbs says. \"The results were stunning. They revealed, at a very fine level of detail, the 3D architecture of the receptor, with two toxin molecules bound to it exactly where we know the much smaller acetylcholine binds.\"\n\nThe results showed how the toxin blocks acetylcholine by competing for the same binding site, paralyzing the receptor in the closed configuration and preventing the flow of electrochemical messages. The structure also reveals why the toxin binds so tightly and selectively to the receptor and how the venom paralyzes prey, including humans, who are unfortunate enough to get bitten by the snake.\n\n\"We learned a tremendous amount from the new 3D structure beyond how the toxin works to poison the receptor,\" Hibbs says. Lead author Md. Mahfuzur Rahman, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Hibbs lab, adds that the nicotinic acetylcholine neuromuscular receptor is a therapeutic target for several genetic diseases that cause muscle weakness, which the team also investigated.\n\n\"Here we mapped the mutations related to CMS to three principal regions on the receptor structure.

They soared the skies for 160 million years -- much longer than any species of modern bird. Despite their aeronautic excellence, these ancient flyers have largely been overlooked in the pursuit of bioinspired flight technologies. In a review published April 15 in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution researchers outline why and how the physiology of fossil flyers could provide ancient solutions to modern flight problems, such as aerial stability and the ability of drones to self-launch.\n\n\"There's a lot of really cool stuff in the fossil record that goes unexplored because engineers generally don't look to paleontology when thinking about inspiration for flight,\" says first author Liz Martin-Silverstone (@gimpasaura), a post-doctoral researcher and paleontologist at the University of Bristol. \"If we're only looking at modern animals for inspiration, we're really missing a large degree of the morphology out there and ignoring a lot of options that I think could be useful.\"\n\nPreviously, engineers have largely focused on the physiology of modern birds and insects when designing aeronautic technology like drones and planes; they might not think to examine fossils that -- by their nature -- are often incomplete. However, Martin-Silverstone says there are a select few pterosaur fossils that provide extraordinarily deep insight into the anatomy of their wings, which is essential for understanding their flight capabilities.\n\n\"There are two or three absolutely amazingly preserved pterosaur fossils that let you see the different layers within the wing membrane, giving us insight into its fibrous components. Also, some fossils are preserved enough to show the wing attachments beneath the hip,\" she says. \"While you don't know exactly the shape of the wing, by knowing the membrane attachments you can model the effectiveness of different wing shapes and determine which would have performed best in natural conditions.\" Analyzing the morphology and predicted flight mechanics of these ancient creatures has revealed novel tactics that don't exist in modern flyers.\n\nBecoming airborne is one example. Launching into the air through a leap or jump, also known as ballistic launch, is standard throughout the animal kingdom. However, larger birds require a running start to gain enough momentum for lift-off. Pterosaurs, on the other hand, may have developed a method to launch from a stationary position despite some specimens weighing nearly 300 kilograms. One hypothesis, proposed by review co-author Mike Habib (@aeroevo) of the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, suggests that the wing membrane and the robust muscle attachments in the wings allowed pterosaurs to generate a high-powered leap off of their elbows and wrists, giving them enough height to become airborne.\n\n\"Today, something like a drone requires a flat surface to launch and is quite restricted on how it actually gets into the air. The unique launch physiology of pterosaurs might be able to help solve some of these problems,\" Martin-Silverstone says.\n\nPterosaurs can also provide insights on how to prevent flight instability once in the air. Contrary to how sails can become unstable in a strong wind, pterosaurs evolved strategies to resist flutter of their broad wings. \"So far we've struggled to design things like flight suits that can resist the pressures of flight. If we can understand how pterosaurs did it, for instance by understanding how their wing membrane was actually structured, then that's something we can use to answer modern engineering questions,\" she says.\n\nThese unique physiological elements aren't limited to pterosaurs, either. Other ancient flyers, like Microraptor, had feathered wings on both their arms and legs, while newly discovered dinosaur, Yi qi, had wings that combine feathers with a bat-like membrane -- a body plan that has never been repeated since their extinction. As such, the authors say many flight strategies remain to be properly explored.\n\nMartin-Silverstone suggests that if we combine our knowledge from flyers both living and extinct, we will have a much better chance of overcoming the hurdles still hindering human-made flight. She says: \"We want biologists and engineers alike to reach out to paleontologists when they are looking to solving flight problems, as there might be something extinct that could help. If we limit ourselves to looking at the modern animals, then we're missing out on a lot of diversity that might be useful.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415133638.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T17:36:38", "title": "How 'hypermutated' malignant brain tumors escape chemotherapy and immunotherapy", "text": "Cancers whose cells are riddled with large numbers of DNA mutations often respond favorably to drugs called checkpoint blockers that unleash the immune system against the tumor. But a new study shows that malignant brain tumors known as gliomas generally don't respond to the immunotherapy drugs even when the tumor cells are \"hypermutated\" -- having thousands of DNA mutations that, in other kinds of cancer, provoke the immune system into an attack mode.\n\nAn analysis of more than 10,000 gliomas and clinical outcomes reported in Nature by scientists in Boston and Paris found that glioma patients whose tumors were hypermutated actually had no significant benefit when treated with checkpoint blockers. This finding was somewhat unexpected, because immune checkpoint blockers have been shown to be often effective in other types of cancer -- including melanoma, colorectal, and endometrial cancers -- if their cells have defective DNA damage repair mechanisms and are hypermutated. The results of the study are further evidence of the challenges presented by malignant brain tumors, which are initially treated by surgery but are difficult to remove in their entirety, necessitating systemic treatment radiation and chemotherapy.\n\nImmunotherapy, which has become an important tool in cancer treatment in recent years, has yet to show much benefit in brain tumors. \"It seems that in gliomas you can have hundreds or thousands of DNA mutations and the immune system is still suppressed and ultimately unable to recognize cancer cells as being abnormal,\" said Mehdi Touat, MD, of the Sorbonne University and neuro-oncologist in Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospitals in Paris, a co-first author of the report. Keith Ligon, MD, PhD, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, is co-senior author of the study.\n\nThe results also suggest that the quality of mutations, not just their absolute number, may be important when predicting who will benefit from immune checkpoint treatments. \"Our data indicates that the absence of an immune response in gliomas likely results from several complex aspects of immunosuppression in the brain which will need further characterization,\" wrote the authors. \"Approaches that increase the tumor microenvironment infiltration by cytotoxic lymphocytes are likely required to improve immunotherapy response in gliomas.\"\n\nLigon noted that the study also showed how treatment with the drug temozolomide -- the standard chemotherapy for gliomas -- can lead to the tumors becoming hypermutated and resistant to further treatment. Temozolomide (Temodar) does benefit patients, but in some patients it also seems to cause the emergence of hypermutated cells that can resist the drug and then these surviving glioma cells cause the tumors to progress, said Ligon. The researchers said the results do not suggest that temozolomide should not be used in glioma patients, but that once resistance develops, further treatment with temozolomide would not be effective. Instead, they showed that treatment with another chemotherapy drug called lomustine (CeeNU) seemed to still be effective in that setting for some patients.\n\n\"We've demonstrated that the longer people took temozolomide the more likely it was that their tumors became hypermutated,\" said David Reardon, MD, clinical director of Dana-Farber's Center for Neuro-Oncology and an author on the Nature report. He said the finding that treatment with lomustine was not associated with the hypermutated resistant state is a glimmer of good news. \"If a patient becomes resistant to temozolomide, there is not much to offer them, but this suggests that some of these patients might get benefit from lomustine. Our data suggests we could try this.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415133627.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T17:36:27", "title": "A gut-to-brain circuit drives sugar preference and may explain sugar cravings", "text": "A little extra sugar can make us crave just about anything, from cookies to condiments to coffee smothered in whipped cream. But its sweetness doesn't fully explain our desire. Instead, new research shows this magic molecule has a back channel to the brain.\n\nLike other sweet-tasting things, sugar triggers specialized taste buds on the tongue. But it also switches on an entirely separate neurological pathway -- one that begins in the gut, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator Charles Zuker and colleagues report on April 15, 2020 in the journal Nature.\n\nIn the intestines, signals heralding sugar's arrival travel to the brain, where they nurture an appetite for more, the team's experiments with mice showed. This gut-to-brain pathway appears picky, responding only to sugar molecules -- not artificial sweeteners.\n\nScientists already knew sugar exerted unique control over the brain. A 2008 study, for example, showed that mice without the ability to taste sweetness can still prefer sugar. Zuker's team's discovery of a sugar-sensing pathway helps explain why sugar is special -- and points to ways we might quell our insatiable appetite for it.\n\n\"We need to separate the concepts of sweet and sugar,\" says Zuker, a neuroscientist at Columbia University. \"Sweet is liking, sugar is wanting. This new work reveals the neural basis for sugar preference.\"\n\nSweet stuff\n\nThe term sugar is a catchall, encompassing a number of substances our bodies use as fuel. Eating sugar activates the brain's reward system, making humans and mice alike feel good. However, in a world where refined sugar is plentiful, this deeply ingrained appetite can run amok. The average American's annual sugar intake has skyrocketed from less than 10 pounds in the late 1800s to more than 100 pounds today. That increase has come at a cost: Studies have linked excess sugar consumption to numerous health problems, including obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPreviously, Zuker's work showed that sugar and artificial sweeteners switch on the same taste-sensing system. Once in the mouth, these molecules activate the sweet-taste receptors on taste buds, initiating signals that travel to the part of the brain that processes sweetness.\n\nBut sugar affects behavior in a way that artificial sweetener doesn't. Zuker's team ran a test pitting sugar against the sweetener Acesulfame K, which is used in diet soda, sweetening packets, and other products. Offered water with the sweetener or with sugar, mice at first drank both, but within two days switched almost exclusively to sugar water. \"We reasoned this unquenchable motivation that the animal has for consuming sugar, rather than sweetness, might have a neural basis,\" Zuker says.\n\nSugar circuit\n\nBy visualizing brain activity when the rodents consumed sugar versus artificial sweetener or water, the researchers for the first time identified the brain region that responds solely to sugar: the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNST). Found in the brain stem, separate from where mice process taste, the cNST is a hub for information about the state of the body.\n\nThe path to the cNST, the team determined, begins in the lining of the intestine. There, sensor molecules spark a signal that travels via the vagus nerve, which provides a direct line of information from the intestines to the brain.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis gut-to-brain circuit favors one form of sugar: glucose and similar molecules. It ignores artificial sweeteners -- perhaps explaining why these additives can't seem to fully replicate sugar's appeal. It also overlooks some other types of sugar, most notably fructose, which is found in fruit. Glucose is a source of energy for all living things. That could explain why the system's specificity for the molecule evolved, say study lead authors Hwei Ee Tan and Alexander Sisti, who are graduate students in Zuker's lab.\n\nPreviously, scientists speculated that sugar's energy content, or calories, explained its appeal, since many artificial sweeteners lack calories. However, Zuker's study showed this is not the case, since calorie-free, glucose-like molecules can also activate the gut-to-brain sugar-sensing pathway.\n\nTo better understand how the brain's strong preference for sugar develops, his group is now studying the connections between this gut-brain sugar circuit and other brain systems, like those involved in reward, feeding, and emotions. Although his studies are in mice, Zuker believes that essentially the same glucose-sensing pathway exists in humans.\n\n\"Uncovering this circuit helps explain how sugar directly impacts our brain to drive consumption,\" he says. \"It also exposes new potential targets and opportunities for strategies to help curtail our insatiable appetite for sugar.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415133625.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T17:36:25", "title": "Origin of defects that sap potential of next gen solar tech", "text": "A multi-institutional collaboration, co-led by scientists at the University of Cambridge and Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), has discovered the source of efficiency-limiting defects in potential materials for next generation solar cells and flexible LEDs.\n\nIn the last decade, perovskites -- a diverse range of materials with a specific crystal structure -- have emerged as promising alternatives to silicon solar cells, as they are cheaper and greener to manufacture, whilst achieving a comparable level of efficiency.\n\nHowever, perovskites still show significant performance losses and instabilities. Most research to date has focused on ways to remove these losses, but their actual physical causes remain unknown.\n\nNow, in a paper published today in Nature, researchers from Dr. Sam Stranks's group at Cambridge University's Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology and Cavendish Laboratory, and Professor Keshav Dani's Femtosecond Spectroscopy Unit at OIST in Japan, identify the source of the problem. Their discovery could streamline efforts to increase the efficiency of perovskites, bringing them closer to mass-market production.\n\nWhen light hits a perovskite solar cell or when electricity passes through a perovskite LED, electrons are excited and can jump to a higher energy state. The negatively-charged electrons leave behind spaces, called holes, which then have a relatively positive charge. Both excited electrons and holes can move through the perovskite material, and therefore act as charge carriers.\n\nBut in perovskites, a certain type of defect called a \"deep trap\" can occur, where energized charge carriers can get stuck. The trapped electrons and holes recombine, losing their energy to heat rather than converting it into useful electricity or light, which significantly reduces the efficiency and stability of solar panels and LEDs.\n\nadvertisement\n\nUntil now, very little was known about the cause of these traps, in part because they appear to behave rather differently to traps in traditional solar cell materials.\n\nIn 2015, Dr. Stranks's group published a Science paper looking at the luminescence of perovskites, which reveals how good they are at absorbing or emitting light. We found that the material was very heterogeneous; you had quite large regions that were bright and luminescent, and other regions that were really dark,\" said Dr. Stranks. \"These dark regions correspond to power losses in solar cells or LEDs. But what was causing the power loss was always a mystery, especially because perovskites are otherwise so defect-tolerant.\"\n\nDue to limitations of standard imaging techniques, the group couldn't tell if the darker areas were caused by one, large trap site, or many smaller traps, making it difficult to establish why they were forming only in certain regions.\n\nLater on in 2017, Prof. Dani's group at OIST published a paper in Nature Nanotechnology, where they made a movie of how electrons behave in semiconductors after absorbing light. \"You can learn a lot from being able to see how charges move in a material or device after shining light. For example, you can see where they might be getting trapped,\" said Prof. Dani. \"However, these charges are hard to visualize as they move very fast -- on the timescale of a millionth of a billionth of a second; and over very short distances -- on the length scale of a billionth of a meter.\n\nOn hearing of Prof. Dani's work, Dr. Stranks reached out to see if they could work together to address the problem visualizing the dark regions in perovskites.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe team at OIST used a technique called photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) for the first time on perovskites, where they probed the material with ultraviolet light and formed an image from the emitted electrons.\n\nWhen they looked at the material, they found that the dark regions contained traps, around 10-100 nanometers in length, which were clusters of smaller atomic-sized trap sites. These trap clusters were spread unevenly throughout the perovskite material, explaining the heterogeneous luminescence seen in Dr. Stranks's earlier research.\n\nIntriguingly, when the researchers overlaid images of the trap sites onto images that showed the crystal grains of the perovskite material, they found that the trap clusters only formed at specific places, at the boundaries between certain grains.\n\nTo understand why this only occurred at certain grain boundaries, the groups worked with Professor Paul Midgley's team from Cambridge University's Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, who used a technique called scanning electron diffraction to create detailed images of the perovskite crystal structure. Prof. Midgley's team made use of the electron microscopy setup at the ePSIC facility at the Diamond Light Source Synchrotron, which has specialized equipment for imaging beam-sensitive materials, like perovskites.\n\n\"Because these materials are super beam-sensitive, typical techniques that you would use to probe local crystal structure on these length scales can actually quite quickly change the material as you're looking at it,\" explained Tiarnan Doherty, a PhD student in Stranks's group and co-lead author of the study. \"Instead, we were able to use very low exposure doses and therefore prevent damage.\n\n\"From the work at OIST, we knew where the trap clusters were located, and at ePSIC, we scanned around that same area to see the local structure. We were able to quickly pinpoint unexpected variations in the crystal structure around the trap sites.\"\n\nThe group discovered that the trap clusters only formed at junctions where an area of the material with slightly distorted structure met an area with pristine structure.\n\n\"In perovskites, we have these regular mosaic grains of material and most of the grains are nice and pristine -- the structure we would expect,\" said Dr. Stranks. \"But every now and again, you get a grain that's slightly distorted and the chemistry of that grain is inhomogeneous. What was really interesting, and which initially confused us, was that it's not the distorted grain that's the trap but where that grain meets a pristine grain; it's at that junction that the traps form.\"\n\nWith this understanding of the nature of the traps, the team at OIST also used the custom-built PEEM instrumentation to visualize the dynamics of the charge carrier trapping process happening in the perovskite material. \"This was possible as one of the unique features of our PEEM setup is that it can image ultrafast processes -- as short as femtoseconds,\" explained Andrew Winchester, a PhD student in Prof. Dani's Unit, and co-lead author of this study. \"We found that the trapping process was dominated by charge carriers diffusing to the trap clusters.\"\n\nThese discoveries represent a major breakthrough in the quest to bring perovskites to the solar energy market.\n\n\"We still don't know exactly why the traps are clustering there, but we now know that they do form there, and only there,\" said Dr. Stranks. \"That's exciting because it means we now know what to target to bring up the performances of perovskites. We need to target those inhomogeneous phases or get rid of these junctions in some way.\"\n\n\"The fact that charge carriers must first diffuse to the traps could also suggest other strategies to improve these devices,\" said Prof. Dani. \"Maybe we could alter or control the arrangement of the trap clusters, without necessarily changing their average number, such that charge carriers are less likely to reach these defect sites.\"\n\nThe teams' research focused on one particular perovskite structure. The scientists will now be investigating whether the cause of these trapping clusters is universal across all perovskite materials.\n\n\"Most of the progress in device performance has been trial and error and so far, this has been quite an inefficient process,\" said Dr. Stranks. \"To date, it really hasn't been driven by knowing a specific cause and systematically targeting that. This is one of the first breakthroughs that will help us to use the fundamental science to engineer more efficient devices.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415133529.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T17:35:29", "title": "Researchers restore sight in mice by turning skin cells into light-sensing eye cells: New path to modeling eye disease, advancing therapies", "text": "Researchers have discovered a technique for directly reprogramming skin cells into light-sensing rod photoreceptors used for vision.

The NEI is part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nUp until now, researchers have replaced dying photoreceptors in animal models by creating stem cells from skin or blood cells, programming those stem cells to become photoreceptors, which are then transplanted into the back of the eye. In the new study, scientists show that it is possible to skip the stem-cell intermediary step and directly reprogram skins cells into photoreceptors for transplantation into the retina.\n\n\"This is the first study to show that direct, chemical reprogramming can produce retinal-like cells, which gives us a new and faster strategy for developing therapies for age-related macular degeneration and other retinal disorders caused by the loss of photoreceptors,\" said Anand Swaroop, Ph.D., senior investigator in the NEI Neurobiology, Neurodegeneration, and Repair Laboratory, which characterized the reprogrammed rod photoreceptor cells by gene expression analysis.\n\n\"Of immediate benefit will be the ability to quickly develop disease models so we can study mechanisms of disease. The new strategy will also help us design better cell replacement approaches,\" he said.\n\nScientists have studied induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with intense interest over the past decade. IPSCs are developed in a lab from adult cells -- rather than fetal tissue -- and can be used to make nearly any type of replacement cell or tissue. But iPS cell reprogramming protocols can take six months before cells or tissues are ready for transplantation. By contrast, the direct reprogramming described in the current study coaxed skin cells into functional photoreceptors ready for transplantation in only 10 days. The researchers demonstrated their technique in mouse eyes, using both mouse- and human-derived skin cells.\n\n\"Our technique goes directly from skin cell to photoreceptor without the need for stem cells in between,\" said the study's lead investigator, Sai Chavala, M.D., CEO and president of CIRC Therapeutics and the Center for Retina Innovation. Chavala is also director of retina services at KE Eye Centers of Texas and a professor of surgery at Texas Christian University and University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) School of Medicine, Fort Worth.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDirect reprogramming involves bathing the skin cells in a cocktail of five small molecule compounds that together chemically mediate the molecular pathways relevant for rod photoreceptor cell fate. The result are rod photoreceptors that mimic native rods in appearance and function.\n\nThe researchers performed gene expression profiling, which showed that the genes expressed by the new cells were similar to those expressed by real rod photoreceptors. At the same time, genes relevant to skin cell function had been downregulated.\n\nThe researchers transplanted the cells into mice with retinal degeneration and then tested their pupillary reflexes, which is a measure of photoreceptor function after transplantation. Under low-light conditions, constriction of the pupil is dependent on rod photoreceptor function. Within a month of transplantation, six of 14 (43%) animals showed robust pupil constriction under low light compared to none of the untreated controls.\n\nMoreover, treated mice with pupil constriction were significantly more likely to seek out and spend time in dark spaces compared with treated mice with no pupil response and untreated controls. Preference for dark spaces is a behavior that requires vision and reflects the mouse's natural tendency to seek out safe, dark locations as opposed to light ones.\n\n\"Even mice with severely advanced retinal degeneration, with little chance of having living photoreceptors remaining, responded to transplantation. Such findings suggest that the observed improvements were due to the lab-made photoreceptors rather than to an ancillary effect that supported the health of the host's existing photoreceptors,\" said the study's first author Biraj Mahato, Ph.D., research scientist, UNTHSC.\n\nThree months after transplantation, immunofluorescence studies confirmed the survival of the lab-made photoreceptors, as well as their synaptic connections to neurons in the inner retina.\n\nFurther research is needed to optimize the protocol to increase the number of functional transplanted photoreceptors.\n\n\"Importantly, the researchers worked out how this direct reprogramming is mediated at the cellular level.

They removed records of people who had recently been hospitalized or who had an opioid poisoning diagnosis within the preceding six months. They also removed people who did not have at least six months of continuous insurance claims information at the time of the prescription and people with certain missing demographic information.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe remaining 153,385 instances of new outpatient prescriptions of these reserved medications occurred among 131,756 people from across the U.S.\n\nLess than 48% of these showed evidence of prior opioid tolerance.\n\n\"Our findings are concerning because it appears that many people starting to use these drugs may be at risk for some quite serious outcomes,\" says Molly Jeffery, Ph.D., the study's lead author. \"In general, physicians are allowed to prescribe drugs off-label -- that is, without adhering to the indications or warnings included in the drug label. But these particular drugs are considered risky enough that the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requires manufacturers to provide additional oversight and education to physicians to make sure they understand the risks associated with the drugs.\" Dr. Jeffery is also the scientific director of Emergency Medicine Research at Mayo Clinic.\n\nFurthermore, regulations for one of the drug classes that the team studied -- transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl, or TIRFS -- require physicians who prescribe, and pharmacists who dispense, the drugs to complete a certification process and enroll each patient.\n\n\"This process is meant to ensure patient safety while preserving access to the drugs for people who really need them,\" she says. \"All of the drugs we studied have appropriate uses, but that does require that the physicians prescribing the drugs know the risks.\"\n\nA key contribution of this study is that researchers were able to look for additional evidence of opioid tolerance in linked electronic health records for about 15% of the group, or 20,044 patients. They determined that between 0.5% and 4% of episodes of use of the reserved medications had additional information in the patient's record that showed evidence of tolerance not indicated in claims data. This additional evidence includes prescriptions showing up in the electronic health record but not in claims.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Critiques of prior studies using only claims data raised the possibility that patients might have opioid prescriptions that don't show up in insurance claims,\" notes Dr. Jeffery. \"For example, if a person paid for a prescription with cash instead of submitting it to insurance.\"\n\nPrescriptions noted in the electronic health record may, or may not, have been filled.\n\n\"We used natural language processing -- a type of artificial intelligence -- to look through physician notes in the patients' health records, and also looked at information about prescriptions written,\" says Dr. Jeffery. \"We did not find substantial additional evidence that patients were opioid-tolerant when they started these drugs.\"\n\n\"There was no evidence of opioid tolerance in more than half of the patients in our study,\" Dr. Jeffery says. \"Given how common that was, we wanted to use the clinical notes to look for reasons why physicians would have prescribed these drugs in people who were not opioid-tolerant.\n\nThe team's analysis of clinical notes didn't give any insight into physicians' reasons for prescribing to people who were not opioid-tolerant. However, the physicians on the research team had some guesses about what might be behind these prescriptions.\n\n\"My colleagues and I discussed the possibility that, in particular, fentanyl patches might have been prescribed for patients who have serious medical or surgical problems that limit the ability to swallow oral medications,\" says Dr. Hooten. \"Also, fentanyl patches contain a three-day supply of the drug, so patches could be a possible solution for patients who may not be able to take oral medications on a scheduled basis.\"\n\nDr. Hooten hopes his fellow clinicians pay attention to these findings.\n\n\"I often treat people mired in addiction,\" he says. \"As physicians, our first charge is to do no harm, and with opioids -- especially this group of medications -- the risk of harm is very real.\"\n\n\"It concerns me that I might have patients coming to me whose substance abuse disorder was exacerbated by inappropriate prescribing practices.\"\n\nThis work was supported by a Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation grant to Yale University and Mayo Clinic from the FDA (U01FD005938).

These sensors can be embedded in plant leaves, where they report on hydrogen peroxide signaling waves.\n\nPlants use hydrogen peroxide to communicate within their leaves, sending out a distress signal that stimulates leaf cells to produce compounds that will help them repair damage or fend off predators such as insects. The new sensors can use these hydrogen peroxide signals to distinguish between different types of stress, as well as between different species of plants.\n\n\"Plants have a very sophisticated form of internal communication, which we can now observe for the first time. That means that in real-time, we can see a living plant's response, communicating the specific type of stress that it's experiencing,\" says Michael Strano, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT.\n\nThis kind of sensor could be used to study how plants respond to different types of stress, potentially helping agricultural scientists develop new strategies to improve crop yields. The researchers demonstrated their approach in eight different plant species, including spinach, strawberry plants, and arugula, and they believe it could work in many more.\n\nStrano is the senior author of the study, which appears today in Nature Plants. MIT graduate student Tedrick Thomas Salim Lew is the lead author of the paper.\n\nEmbedded sensors\n\nOver the past several years, Strano's lab has been exploring the potential for engineering \"nanobionic plants\" -- plants that incorporate nanomaterials that give the plants new functions, such as emitting light or detecting water shortages. In the new study, he set out to incorporate sensors that would report back on the plants' health status.\n\nadvertisement\n\nStrano had previously developed carbon nanotube sensors that can detect various molecules, including hydrogen peroxide. About three years ago, Lew began working on trying to incorporate these sensors into plant leaves. Studies in Arabidopsis thaliana, often used for molecular studies of plants, had suggested that plants might use hydrogen peroxide as a signaling molecule, but its exact role was unclear.\n\nLew used a method called lipid exchange envelope penetration (LEEP) to incorporate the sensors into plant leaves. LEEP, which Strano's lab developed several years ago, allows for the design of nanoparticles that can penetrate plant cell membranes. As Lew was working on embedding the carbon nanotube sensors, he made a serendipitous discovery.\n\n\"I was training myself to get familiarized with the technique, and in the process of the training I accidentally inflicted a wound on the plant. Then I saw this evolution of the hydrogen peroxide signal,\" he says.\n\nHe saw that after a leaf was injured, hydrogen peroxide was released from the wound site and generated a wave that spread along the leaf, similar to the way that neurons transmit electrical impulses in our brains. As a plant cell releases hydrogen peroxide, it triggers calcium release within adjacent cells, which stimulates those cells to release more hydrogen peroxide.\n\n\"Like dominos successively falling, this makes a wave that can propagate much further than a hydrogen peroxide puff alone would,\" Strano says. \"The wave itself is powered by the cells that receive and propagate it.\"\n\nThis flood of hydrogen peroxide stimulates plant cells to produce molecules called secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids or carotenoids, which help them to repair the damage. Some plants also produce other secondary metabolites that can be secreted to fend off predators. These metabolites are often the source of the food flavors that we desire in our edible plants, and they are only produced under stress.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA key advantage of the new sensing technique is that it can be used in many different plant species. Traditionally, plant biologists have done much of their molecular biology research in certain plants that are amenable to genetic manipulation, including Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco plants. However, the new MIT approach is applicable to potentially any plant.\n\n\"In this study, we were able to quickly compare eight plant species, and you would not be able to do that with the old tools,\" Strano says.\n\nThe researchers tested strawberry plants, spinach, arugula, lettuce, watercress, and sorrel, and found that different species appear to produce different waveforms -- the distinctive shape produced by mapping the concentration of hydrogen peroxide over time. They hypothesize that each plant's response is related to its ability to counteract the damage. Each species also appears to respond differently to different types of stress, including mechanical injury, infection, and heat or light damage.\n\n\"This waveform holds a lot of information for each species, and even more exciting is that the type of stress on a given plant is encoded in this waveform,\" Strano says. \"You can look at the real time response that a plant experiences in almost any new environment.\"\n\nStress response\n\nThe near-infrared fluorescence produced by the sensors can be imaged using a small infrared camera connected to a Raspberry Pi, a $35 credit-card-sized computer similar to the computer inside a smartphone. \"Very inexpensive instrumentation can be used to capture the signal,\" Strano says.\n\nApplications for this technology include screening different species of plants for their ability to resist mechanical damage, light, heat, and other forms of stress, Strano says. It could also be used to study how different species respond to pathogens, such as the bacteria that cause citrus greening and the fungus that causes coffee rust.\n\n\"One of the things I'm interested in doing is understanding why some types of plants exhibit certain immunity to these pathogens and others don't,\" he says.\n\nStrano and his colleagues in the Disruptive and Sustainable Technology for Agricultural Precision interdisciplinary research group at the MIT-Singapore Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), MIT's research enterprise in Singapore, are also interested in studying is how plants respond to different growing conditions in urban farms.\n\nOne problem they hope to address is shade avoidance, which is seen in many species of plants when they are grown at high density. Such plants turn on a stress response that diverts their resources into growing taller, instead of putting energy into producing crops. This lowers the overall crop yield, so agricultural researchers are interested in engineering plants so that don't turn on that response.\n\n\"Our sensor allows us to intercept that stress signal and to understand exactly the conditions and the mechanism that are happening upstream and downstream in the plant that gives rise to the shade avoidance,\" Strano says.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Research Foundation of Singapore, the Singapore Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR), and the U.S. Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship Program.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415133454.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T17:34:54", "title": "Questionable stability of dissipative topological models for classical and quantum systems", "text": "Energy conservation lies at the core of every physical theory. Effective mathematical models however can feature energy gain and/or loss and thus break the energy conservation law by only capturing the physics of a subsystem. As a result, the Hamiltonian, the function that describes the system's energy, loses an important mathematical property: it is no longer Hermitian. Such non-Hermitian Hamiltonians have successfully described experimental setups for both classical problems -- in e.g. some optical systems and electrical circuits -- and quantum ones, in modelling the motion of electrons in crystalline solids. In a new paper in EPJ D, physicists Rebekka Koch from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Jan Carl Budich from Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, in Germany, describe how these functions provide new insights into behaviour at the edges of topological materials.\n\nHowever, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians break with concepts that are known from energy-conserving systems such as the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) in these materials. This correspondence relates the topological properties of the bulk of the material to the physics of the edges. In the Hermitian case, the bulk of such a material can be described by neglecting the edges and just assuming the material to be infinite or periodic, since boundary effects do not affect the physics of the inside.\n\nSurprisingly, this holds no longer true if the energy is not conserved: the properties of the boundary suddenly have a huge influence on the bulk system and subsequently have to be taken into account. It leads to a drastically altered BBC (bulk-boundary correspondence) for non-Hermitian systems. In particular, Koch and Budich studied different strengths of the coupling between boundaries and their effect on the bulk system. Knowing that in realistic quantum mechanical systems there is always an interaction between the edges -- admittedly an extremely small one -- they explored the extent to which decoupled edges are generally observable. Koch and Budich found that the spectrum of the topological material is stable under physically motivated perturbations such as the suppressed interactions between the boundaries.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415133451.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T17:34:51", "title": "The retention effect of training", "text": "Especially in times of shortage of skilled workers, some companies do not offer continuing education that improves the employees' chances on the labour market.

Even if the participants receive a certificate from an external training provider and can provide convincing evidence of their newly acquired skills, the retention effect remains positive.\n\nData basis of the analysis\n\nFor their study, Zwick and Dietz analysed the continuing education and career information of approximately 4,300 employees in 150 German companies over five consecutive years.

To overcome this challenge, the team, led by Dr Inga Conti-Jerpe, compared the stable isotope \"fingerprint\" of hundreds of corals collected in Hong Kong to that of their associated algae. The results showed that some corals have isotopic fingerprints that match that of their algae, indicating the two partners share nutrients. Other corals have fingerprints distinct from their algae due to a diet based on the capture and consumption of prey particles in the water. The researchers found that more predatory corals had significantly larger polyps (an individual coral unit - much like an anemone) than corals more dependent on photosynthesis, a previously contentious relationship first proposed in 1974.\n\n\"We knew that polyp size is a factor that affects the surface area to volume ratio of a coral, a trait that other scientists have observed might be linked to delayed bleaching in the field. We decided to run a warming experiment with our Hong Kong corals to see if their diet accurately predicted how long they could withstand elevated temperatures without bleaching - and it did.\" explains Dr Conti-Jerpe.\n\nThese results have implications for how coral reefs will change as climate change progresses. Corals dependent on photosynthesis bleach faster while predatory corals can withstand warming temperatures longer. \"The results of our study help predict which coral species are more likely to survive as oceans warm. Unfortunately, what we found is that the most susceptible species are those that are commonly used in coral reef restoration efforts. To ensure the long-term success of reef rehabilitation, restoration initiatives should shift their focus to bleaching-resistant species.\" said Dr David Baker, Associate Professor of School of Biological Sciences and Swire Institute of Marine Science who supervised the study.\n\nWhile predatory nutrition can confer protection from bleaching, the scientists note that given sustained elevated temperatures, all the species in the study eventually bleached. \"Capturing a lot of food doesn't save corals from bleaching,\" explains Dr Conti-Jerpe, \"it just buys them a little more time - time that they desperately need.\" The findings of this study will help scientists, conservationists and policy makers anticipate which corals will disappear first and how this will change reef ecosystems overall, including the services they provide.\n\nStable isotope data are an established tool for investigating diet - they are derived from measuring the different forms of common elements, such as carbon and nitrogen that have the same function biologically but differ ever so slightly in mass. For instance, nitrogen - an essential building block for DNA and protein - comes in a common 'light' isotope (14N) and a rare 'heavy' isotope (15N). When it comes to diet, animals accumulate 15N if they are sitting higher on the food chain - a carnivore will have more 15N than an herbivore. The corals in this study that had stable isotope values different from that of their algae had more 15N and thus must be more predatory.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200415133447.htm", "published": "2020-04-15T17:34:47", "title": "Childhood exposure to parental smoking linked to poorer cognitive function in midlife", "text": "A Finnish study coordinated by the Research Centre of Applied and Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Turku, Finland, shows that exposure to parental smoking in childhood and adolescence is associated with poorer learning ability and memory in midlife.\n\nWith the aging population, cognitive deficits such as difficulties in learning and memory are becoming more common. Active smoking is known to be detrimental to cognitive function and to contribute to the occurrence of cognitive deficits. Similar short-term associations have been observed for secondhand smoking. Results from a longitudinal Finnish study show that the harmful effects of childhood secondhand smoking exposure may carry over to midlife learning ability and memory function.\n\n- Previous studies have focused on adulthood exposure or on the short-term effects of childhood exposure, whereas this study brings novel information on the long-term associations between secondhand smoking exposure in childhood and cognitive function in midlife, says Senior Researcher Suvi Rovio from the Research Centre of Applied and Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Turku.\n\nThe results of this study highlight that the focus of prevention of secondhand smoking exposure should be on children and adolescents in order to promote brain health in adulthood.

Information is encoded in two classical states (\"0\" and \"1\") of a bit. This means that capacities of a classical computer increase linearly with the number of bits. To deal with emerging scientific and industrial problems, large computing facilities or supercomputers are built.\n\nQuantum entanglement enhancing capacity\n\nA quantum computer is operated using quantum gates, i.e. basic circuit operations on quantum bits (qubits) that are made of microscopic quantum particles, such as atoms and molecules. A fundamentally new mechanism in a quantum computer is the utilisation of quantum entanglement, which can bind two or a group of qubits together such that their state can no longer be described by classical physics. The capacity of a quantum computer increases exponentially with the number of qubits. The efficient usage of quantum entanglement drastically enhances the capacity of a quantum computer to be able to deal with challenging problems in areas including cryptography, material, and medicine sciences.\n\nAmong the different physical systems that can be used to make a quantum computer, trapped ions have led the field for years. The main obstacle towards a large-scale trapped ion quantum computer is the slow-down of computing operations as the system is scaled-up. This new research may have found the answer to this problem.\n\nThe experimental work was conducted by the group of Markus Hennrich at SU using giant Rydberg ions, 100,000,000 times larger than normal atoms or ions. These huge ions are highly interactive, and exchange quantum information in less than a microsecond. The interaction between them creates quantum entanglement. Chi Zhang from the University of Stockholm and colleagues used the entangling interaction to carry out a quantum computing operation (an entangling gate) around 100 times faster than is typical in trapped ion systems.\n\nChi Zhang explains, \"Usually quantum gates slow down in bigger systems. This isn't the case for our quantum gate and Rydberg ion gates in general! Our gate might allow quantum computers to be scaled up to sizes where they are truly useful!\"\n\nTheoretical calculations supporting the experiment and investigating error sources have been conducted by Weibin Li (University of Nottingham, UK) and Igor Lesanovsky (University of Nottingham, UK, and University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany). Their theoretical work confirmed that there is indeed no slowdown expected once the ion crystals become larger, highlighting the prospect of a scalable quantum computer.\n\nWeibin Li, Assistant Professor, School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Nottingham adds: \"Our theoretical analysis shows that a trapped Rydberg ion quantum computer is not only fast, but also scalable, making large-scale quantum computation possible without worrying about environmental noise.

Guangming Tao and colleagues wanted to develop a more practical textile for personal thermal management that could overcome all of these limitations.\n\nThe researchers freeze-spun silk and chitosan, a material from the hard outer skeleton of shellfish, into colored fibers with porous microstructures. They filled the pores with polyethylene glycol (PEG), a phase-changing polymer that absorbs and releases thermal energy.

Less attention has been given to other biological barriers, such as the intestine's lining, through which oral drugs pass into the bloodstream. The few small studies published on this subject, however, suggest that this absorption process may be disrupted in AD. Joseph A. Nicolazzo and colleagues wanted to know if these changes could occur with drugs commonly prescribed to AD patients.\n\nUsing mice that serve as a model for AD, the team measured absorption of compounds that move from the small intestine to the bloodstream through three different mechanisms. For example, blood plasma levels of diazepam, which diffuses passively through intestinal cells to reach the bloodstream, were similar in AD mice compared with control mice. But AD mice had less valsartan and digoxin in their plasma than controls. Passage of these drugs through intestinal cells is controlled by transporters that could be disrupted by AD, according to the team's prior research.

In particular, the levels of bacteria in the Bifidobacteria family are lower in those with the condition than in healthy individuals.

These results mark the first identification of specific gluten-derived peptides generated directly from intact gluten proteins by Bifidobacteria activity and the immunological responses to them by human cells, paving the way for new treatments and better patient outcomes, say the researchers.", "author": []}]}, "economist_business": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/business-finance/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/business", "articles": []}, "economist_science_and_tech": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/science-technology/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/science", "articles": []}, "fivethirtyeight_science": {"rss": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/feed/", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/", "articles": [{"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-covid-19-is-wreaking-havoc-on-our-ability-to-make-things-including-vaccines/", "published": "2020-04-15T18:28:51", "title": "How COVID-19 Is Wreaking Havoc On Our Ability To Make Things \u2014 Including Vaccines", "text": "So far, Australia has been doing pretty well in the fight against COVID-19. Using a combination of social distancing, tight travel restrictions and contact tracing, the country has kept its death toll under 100 people and seems to be leveling off its new cases. It\u2019s even managed to avoid closing schools. But despite the relatively minor impact the novel coronavirus has had on life in Australia, medical workers are still running low on masks, gloves and gowns.\n\n\u201cSuddenly it feels like a house of cards,\u201d said Simon Quilty, senior staff specialist at Alice Springs Hospital in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite [run out of personal protective equipment], but we\u2019ve come very close to it. We don\u2019t even have the pandemic. If we do get a pandemic, we\u2019re fucked.\u201d\n\nAll around the world, whether hard-hit by the virus or not, countries are running low on crucial supplies. And while shortages are largely confined to disposable medical items for now \u2014 personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs, chemicals used for COVID-19 testing \u2014 experts say other shortages are likely. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is affecting the way we manufacture all sorts of products, and the way we get those products to where they\u2019re needed. People who study these supply chains have seen problems coming for years. Now they\u2019re scrambling to get ahead of the pandemic, before it ends up affecting even our ability to produce the vaccines we hope will stop the disease in its tracks.\n\n\u201cUp until a few weeks ago, I knew very little about the supply chain,\u201d said Megan Ranney, a professor of emergency medicine at Brown University. \u201cIt always just worked. But I\u2019ve learned a bunch, and it\u2019s more fragile than we ever thought possible.\u201d COVID-19 has forced her \u2014 and lots of other hospitalists around the country \u2014 to become supply chain experts on the fly.\n\nA supply chain is a fancy term to describe how products get made and moved all around the globe. It\u2019s a simple concept, but not a simple process. Supply chains aren\u2019t a conveyor belt \u2014 they\u2019re a ballet. And there are many, many ways this spectacular show can fall flat on its face. The production of a single item often involves multiple factories in several different countries and depends on speedy, reliable international shipping to get each piece to the right place at the right time \u2014 and then to the buyers exactly when they need it.\n\nIn fact, experts in both manufacturing and medicine have spent years warning of the risks a pandemic \u2014 or another major disaster \u2014 could cause to supply chains. In 2011, for instance, Quilty documented that the hospital where he worked at the time had less than a 30 days\u2019 supply of penicillin and many other crucial pharmaceutical drugs. A 2017 paper by scientists with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that PPE supplies had run into problems during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic, and warned that the system wasn\u2019t prepared to handle a sudden increase in demand. Multiple reports have been published on how avian flu pandemics could disrupt everything from computer manufacturing to the global food supply.\n\n\u201cPPE is the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Ranney said. She, and other experts, told me that right now, that\u2019s the main place we\u2019re seeing supply chains break down. But those same issues apply to damn near everything else we make and sell. The longer the pandemic goes on, the more products will be affected.\n\nThere are three big problems with the global supply chains, experts told me. First, the push toward lowest-cost production means a lot of cheap goods and cheap components of more valuable goods are made in places with low-cost labor. When those countries experience a pandemic outbreak \u2014 or when a pandemic interrupts transport from those countries \u2014 it creates a bottleneck.\n\nAround half the world\u2019s face masks came from China before the novel coronavirus pandemic began. The virus interrupted manufacturing there early on, Ranney said. Now, China can make masks again, but demand has jumped all over the world, and there are shipping delays. Several companies have told her to expect deliveries to take three or four weeks. In the meantime, she\u2019s been left to sort through sketchy, back-alley PPE dealers, some of whom produce low-quality masks that either fall apart or don\u2019t filter properly on testing. Other would-be suppliers have turned out to be basically the high-stakes equivalent of one of those \u201cyou\u2019ve inherited $3,000,000!\u201d email scams.\n\nAmerican manufacturing companies are starting to switch over production lines to make masks and other protective equipment here \u2014 but that\u2019s not a quick process and presents its own complications. For example, the nonwoven textiles that N95 respirator masks use to filter out viruses have to be made on special machines. There are only a few of those machines in the whole world, said Julie Swann, professor of industrial and systems engineering at North Carolina State University. And you can\u2019t just go buy a new one off the shelf. Her university is producing some of this material now. \u201cBut not at the volume you\u2019d make at a large manufacturer,\u201d she said.\n\nThe second problem is that a global pandemic causes sudden spikes in demand for certain products. Production is designed for steady demand with predictable increases and decreases. A big, unforeseen event, like a pandemic, throws everything out of whack, said Adegoke Oke, professor of supply chain management at Arizona State University\u2019s school of business. Take our toilet paper woes. That supply chain didn\u2019t account for sudden, nationwide increases in having to pee at home. It also didn\u2019t anticipate every office in the nation suddenly holding it, indefinitely. You might think that the demand in one sector could be met by the excess from the other, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. \u201cThe type of toilet paper you use in the office \u2014 the big rolls \u2014 are totally different from what you use at home,\u201d Oke said. \u201cThey require different supply chains and different manufacturing lines.\u201d\n\nAnd when manufacturing capacity can\u2019t keep up with a sudden surge in demand, there are no emergency backup supply closets to raid. That\u2019s because of a popular and widespread business practice called \u201cjust in time\u201d supply. Essentially, it means that businesses from hospitals to grocery stores keep only a small amount of supplies on hand at any given time \u2014 enough to get through a couple of weeks or a month. Just-in-time saves money on warehouse storage, energy and staffing, but it works only if the supplies can be produced and delivered when you need them. \u201cIt\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Oke said. \u201cBut at a time like this, the last thing you want is just-in-time.\u201d\n\nFinally, supply chains are also getting disrupted in some truly surprising ways \u2014 ripple effects that spread from one industry to another. Take the transportation of goods. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty dependent on European tourism \u2014 80 percent of the air cargo capacity across the Atlantic comes aboard passenger flights. When those all but stopped, it created a transportation bottleneck for manufacturing, said James Robinson, an independent consultant who spent 30 years working in vaccine manufacturing for companies like Merck. Airlines are turning their empty passenger jets into cargo flights, but that takes retrofitting and time and money \u2014 and it\u2019s going to increase the cost of shipping, Robinson said.\n\nThen there\u2019s all the food being trashed in response to a pandemic that\u2019s cleared grocery shelves nationwide. The same parallel but separate home and business supply chains that affect the toilet paper supply also affect food. What people eat in a restaurant or at school \u2014 and how much of it they eat \u2014 isn\u2019t the same as what they eat at home. And the farmers who have typically supplied commercial kitchens don\u2019t have the sales, marketing, packaging and transport networks in place to get their food where it\u2019s needed. Fresh vegetables and milk have simply been thrown out. And that\u2019s not to mention facilities\u2019 closing when food industry workers are taken out by illness or migrant farm workers\u2019 not being able to cross borders at future harvest times \u2014 things that researchers have long predicted could cause food shortages in the U.S. during a time of pandemic. \u201cThe food supply could be vulnerable,\u201d Swann said. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want to scare people.\u201d\n\nThese supply chain issues can also create a weird sort of feedback loop: The virus increases demand for certain products, which jumbles supply chains for those products, which in turn hampers efforts to use those products to keep the virus in check. And that gives the virus time to beat up the economy even more.\n\nWhich is all to say that problems with the PPE supply could be only the beginning. As people like Robinson try to coordinate what will become an international effort to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine in the months ahead, for example, they\u2019re looking at what\u2019s going on with products like PPE \u2014 knowing that the same things could happen to vaccines.\n\n\u201cA vaccine manufacturer like Sanofi might source several thousand ingredients to make a vaccine,\u201d Robinson told me. \u201cBut each material is coming from factories with hundreds of sources, and those sources have sources.\u201d Like the connection between holiday travel and international shipping, supply chains for vaccines can end in unexpected places \u2014 like a Chilean tree farm.\n\nRobinson is vice chair of the scientific advisory committee for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an international organization that helps coordinate funding and research for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. CEPI is involved in the development of 10 different coronavirus vaccines, and Robinson expects at least three of those will eventually make it to widespread use. One of these vaccines, though, uses an adjuvant \u2014 a substance to help strengthen the body\u2019s immune response to a vaccine \u2014 that contains an oil extracted from the Quillaja saponaria Molina tree, common to Peru, Chile and Bolivia. The bark is harvested only between November and January each year, so this year\u2019s harvest didn\u2019t take the new coronavirus into account. There\u2019s only so much of that adjuvant available until next year, Robinson said.\n\nOther expected supply chain issues with vaccines are shaped by years of international trade patterns. For example, doses of vaccines are delivered in glass vials, and there\u2019s been a global shortage of glass stretching back to at least 2015. The medical glass industry was just beginning to catch up with increased demand, Robinson said, and now, novel coronavirus vaccines will create additional pressure. Even if the vaccine is loaded into 10-dose vials, that\u2019s still hundreds of millions of vials that will be needed, he told me. Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a novel coronavirus vaccine that Robinson regards as one of the most promising. \u201c[Janssen has] already preordered 250 million vials, and that might be all that\u2019s out there,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to procure another 200 million.\u201d\n\nWhat it boils down to is that even the vaccine industry isn\u2019t prepared for a sudden increase in demand on this scale \u2014 which would likely far outpace even the spikes associated with a bad flu season. \u201cIn 2009, H1N1 rapidly increased manufacturing and got up to 400 million doses in a year. But for a pandemic, we might need billions,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nThe biggest thing experts are taking away from all this is the weakness of that just-in-time supply chain. \u201cIn lean terminology, inventory is waste because it\u2019s supply you aren\u2019t using,\u201d Robinson said. But now, when demand is sharply rising, that inventory would be helpful \u2014 and so many industries are tied together that when one runs out of supply it affects the ability of other industries to keep functioning.\n\nProduction can be ramped up, and it is. But it takes time and investment \u2014 and it\u2019s important to remember that those investments are a risk. We might need American-made masks now, but will we keep buying them after the threat of COVID-19 has passed? Or will we revert to just-in-time supply from cheaper factories overseas? History suggests the latter. During previous epidemics of influenza, Texas-based company Prestige Ameritech saw demand soar, Swann told me. But it proved to be a boom and bust. The company invested in new machines to meet demand during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Swann said. \u201cAnd then they almost went out of business later because [the Texas company\u2019s product] was a little more expensive than the ones from China,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be willing to pay a little more during times of peace without crisis so we have supply available during crisis.\u201d", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/genetic-tracking-helped-us-fight-ebola-why-cant-it-halt-covid-19/", "published": "2020-04-15T16:48:00", "title": "Genetic Tracking Helped Us Fight Ebola. Why Can\u2019t It Halt COVID-19?", "text": "In late 2018, a paper in the journal Nature Microbiology proposed a hypothetical scenario: A young man comes into a Miami hospital with flu-like symptoms and dies of a mysterious pneumonia within days. As more people, including medical workers, fall ill, scientists sequence the virus\u2019 genomes and trace the outbreak to a strain of coronavirus in wild ducks near Palm Beach. A combination of traditional and genomic epidemiological tools reveals that the virus is transmitted through the air and via individual \u201csuperspreaders.\u201d In the end, the disease peaks at around 2,000 cases in a handful of countries, thanks in no small part to what scientists learned when they looked inside the virus\u2019 genome.\n\nThe story sounds eerily familiar, even if it doesn\u2019t quite parallel the ongoing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Within weeks of first diagnosing a mysterious pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, Chinese researchers had already sequenced the virus\u2019 genes and released it to the public. This was supposed to be the first step in containing the disease: Tracking the virus\u2019 genome from the moment it began to spread could tell us how fast it was circulating, and possibly how to stop it. Virologists across the world began to explore the data and mapped the coronavirus\u2019 spread in near real time.\n\nBut this is where the hypothetical scenario falls apart. The novel coronavirus is more infectious, and harder to detect, than the one described in the 2018 paper, said Nathan Grubaugh, its lead author. And a sluggish response compounded the issue. Even the most revolutionary science needs data as fuel, and in the United States, that didn\u2019t come until too late. The relative lack of early testing in the U.S. meant that epidemiologists and local governments didn\u2019t know how many cases there were, or where new ones might be coming from. Genomic tools might have helped public health officials contain a small, well-monitored outbreak. Instead, it\u2019s highlighted how far testing has lagged behind the disease.\n\n\u201cWe assumed preparedness,\u201d said Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at Yale\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cWhich is, looking back on it, incredibly naive.\u201d\n\nThe first sign that viral genomics might transform epidemiology came in the wake of the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. For the first time, on-the-ground, same-day genetic sequencing allowed epidemiologists to examine the genome of the virus as it spread.\n\nIn one data visualization, a series of black lines curled out across a map of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the hardest-hit countries. The black lines jumped from city to city, then country to country, tracking the transmission of the deadly fever, like something out of a movie about a pandemic. Next to the map, though, was something you don\u2019t usually see: a family tree, showing the Ebola genome as it mutated from host to host.\n\nBiostatisticians had used viral genomes to piece together the family tree of the Ebola outbreak, and then used that family tree to map the Ebola virus as it spread. The detail and scope of the map was unprecedented: researchers had examined the genomes of 5 percent of the nearly 30,000 known cases.\n\n\u201cThe West African Ebola outbreak was a watershed moment,\u201d said Duncan MacCannell, the chief science officer for the Advanced Molecular Detection program, an initiative at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that brings together advanced technological research and responses to infectious disease. Papers at the time argued that genome-driven technologies would revolutionize global responses to outbreaks.\n\nAs one review in Nature noted, on-the-ground sequencing and genomic analysis rolled out several months into the Ebola epidemic. Though these methods changed the public health response in real time, by showing that sexual contact and survivors were spreading the disease, their full potential was unclear. \u201cHad [such tools] been deployed earlier, we can only speculate as to their potential impact,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nIn the past, the \u201cdetective work\u201d of outbreak response was a purely \u201cshoe-leather\u201d affair, said Verity Hill, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh who produced an early model of the novel coronavirus\u2019 spread in China. In that traditional, field-based approach, researchers interview infected people and map contact networks to track transmissions. Now, scientists can see those kinds of connections in a virus\u2019 genetic code.\n\nAs a virus jumps from host to host, it mutates slightly, a handful of nucleotides at a time. Future infections will inherit some of those mutations. The mutations rarely change the pathogen\u2019s virulence, but they give researchers a way to place the virus on a family tree, just as a biologist builds a tree of closely related animals.\n\nAn epidemic\u2019s family tree then lets researchers sketch a portrait of how the virus spreads from person to person. Your virus\u2019 genome is likely to be very similar to that of whoever infected you. And if it\u2019s more similar to an infection from Washington state than from China, you have a clue as to how it may have gotten to you in the first place.\n\nIn a fast-spreading outbreak, these findings can help uncover new paths of transmission. Public health officials can use viral genomics to figure out how new cases are arriving, and can then screen travelers and isolate suspected cases before they spread locally. And unlike contact tracing, the genomic picture of the outbreak can connect the dots between patients who don\u2019t know they\u2019ve interacted, and it doesn\u2019t rely on a patient\u2019s memory. But that\u2019s most useful when there are few local cases of the disease, said Gytis Dudas, an evolutionary biologist who created the Ebola visualization.\n\nThere are limitations, though. Researchers still need shoe-leather epidemiology to know, for example, where patients have traveled and when they fell ill, which adds clarity to potentially murky genomic data. The richest insights come from the pairing of traditional and genomic research.\n\nIn the years between the Ebola and COVID-19 outbreaks, scientists built the infrastructure necessary to harness those genomic tools. Today, there are open-access platforms for sharing genome sequences and open-source tools for analyzing that data. Genomics have become integral in responding to and tracking food-borne illnesses and the flu.\n\nSo by the time the novel coronavirus emerged in late 2019, the global health community was ready to dig into its genes.\n\nAt least one researcher was disturbed by what he saw. On Jan. 31, Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at Seattle\u2019s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, wrote a blog post in which he described many closely related strains of the virus coming out of China and southeast Asia in mid-January\u2014 evidence that the virus was spreading quickly between patients without much time to mutate. \u201c[The extent of that spread] couldn\u2019t have been uncovered without immediate testing of hundreds of thousands of people soon after detection,\u201c said Dudas.\n\nAt the time, the World Health Organization had yet to definitively state that widespread person-to-person transmission was driving the epidemic, telling STAT News that \u201cscattered\u201d transmission might still account for most cases. \u201cI spent the week of Jan. 20 alerting every public health official I know,\u201d Bedford wrote.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s now obvious that the novel coronavirus spreads quickly between humans, that information was critical for guiding an early response. If the disease was transmitted repeatedly by animals \u2014 as in the case of the mosquito-borne Zika or MERS, another deadly illness linked to a coronavirus \u2014 the answer would have been to limit contact with the host animals. Otherwise, more dramatic quarantine measures would be needed.\n\nAccording to Dudas, governments around the world had all the signals they needed from early analyses of viral family trees. \u201cThe moment there was undetected transmission [in east Asia], it was a clear sign that bringing [the virus] under control is guaranteed to be difficult\u201d he said. But governments, including the United States, waited too long to act. Rather than stockpile testing equipment and screening travelers at airports as the portrait painted by genomics grew more dire, they sat \u201chypnotized.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first step in responding to an outbreak like this is really understanding where your cases are, and how many you have,\u201d MacCannell said. In other words, the first step is to run lots of tests. In the first weeks of the American outbreak, the CDC was able to sequence every virus it received within two days \u2014 but it received fewer than 100 tests in the first place.\n\nHe added later that the virus is particularly difficult to track from its genome, as it mutates more slowly than other diseases. And because it spreads so quickly, even a few days of lag time in testing and sequencing can be too slow to contain an outbreak.\n\nBy the time genomic epidemiologists had access to a large number of American cases, the virus was already quietly spreading across the country. In late February, Bedford\u2019s lab analyzed a COVID-19 case found in the Seattle suburbs. Their findings suggested that the virus had been in the Seattle area for over a month, and that between 80 and 1,500 people were infected without knowing it.\n\nAs testing has become more widespread and the CDC rolls out a national sequencing partnership, studies have begun to show missed opportunities to contain the virus. Research released this month found that the virus arrived in New York City from Europe weeks before anyone in the city tested positive \u2014 and close to a month before travel restrictions were placed on European flights.\n\nMeanwhile, Grubaugh\u2019s lab has a paper in progress that suggests seven of nine early cases in southern Connecticut were closely related to domestic outbreaks, mostly in Washington state, while one case was linked to a recent import from China and another from Europe. (The team also tested the hypothesis using air travel data, which showed that more passengers were coming to the region from domestic hotspots than abroad.) \u201cWe need to be more worried about what\u2019s happening within the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a domestic problem.\u201d\n\nEventually, these findings will help bring future waves of the coronavirus under control, MacCannell said. \u201cThe one thing that I think is going to be different about this epidemic is the amount of rich genomic data that\u2019s going to be out there in the public domain. Understanding where this virus is going, and where it\u2019s been \u2014 we\u2019re going to have an incredibly rich tapestry.\u201d\n\nAnd that picture can change how officials mount a response. \u201cIn areas where shelter in place has been implemented, genomic data can help us understand where new cases are coming from,\u201d MacCannell said. \u201cAs the wave \u2018passes\u2019 and the pandemic decelerates, genomic data can also become vitally important in stamping out flare-ups as they occur.\u201d It will also reveal which state quarantines and stay-at-home orders were effective and which came too late.\n\nBut responding to the data is also a political problem. \u201cTo anyone who follows this epidemic closely, this should come as zero surprise,\u201d said Grubaugh. \u201cIt should allow people within the task force to be able to convince the president and the vice president that we need to be changing how we address this. We shouldn\u2019t be calling it a foreign virus. But whether or not that happens is \u2026 I mean, I think I\u2019d be pretty naive to think that all of a sudden that would start changing.\u201d", "author": ["Philip Kiefer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/experts-think-we-need-an-army-of-public-health-workers-to-safely-return-to-normal/", "published": "2020-04-14T18:34:06", "title": "Experts Think We Need An Army Of Public Health Workers To Safely Return To Normal", "text": "Experts Think We Need An Army Of Public Health Workers To Safely Return To Normal\n\nThis story first appeared on Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service covering health issues, and California Healthline, an editorially independent publication of the California Health Care Foundation.\n\nLast month, facing the prospect of overwhelmed hospitals and unchecked spread of the novel coronavirus, seven Bay Area county and city health departments joined forces to become the first region in the nation to pass sweeping regulations ordering millions of people indoors and shuttering the local economy.\n\nIt shocked people, but health experts around the country applauded the bold step, which since has been broadly replicated.\n\nThey also say it can\u2019t go on forever. And so Bay Area leaders, along with others around the nation, are trying to figure out how we can resume something akin to normal life without triggering a catastrophic wave of illness and death.\n\nThe shelter-in-place orders were a sledgehammer response to two colliding realities: a little-understood virus that is proving ferociously deadly in vulnerable populations and a withered public health infrastructure that has made it impossible to track and contain the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nFor all the light the new virus has shone on vulnerabilities of the U.S. hospital system \u2014 shortfalls in hospital capacity, ventilators and protective gear \u2014 what many officials see are the cracks in the foundations of public health.\n\n\u201cNothing should come as a surprise,\u201d said Laura Biesiadecki, senior director for preparedness, recovery and response with the National Association of County and City Health Officials, which works with more than 3,000 local health departments. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in COVID-19 is an exacerbation of existing fault lines that everyone in the public health community has recognized over the years.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s broad agreement that core public health work \u2014 the ability to find people with the virus and prevent them from passing it to others \u2014 will be essential to reopening schools and businesses. That strategy is endorsed by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who recently told NPR the agency was working on a plan to deploy more disease investigators.\n\nWe spoke with more than two dozen health experts to get their thoughts on what public health resources will be needed to reopen the economy.\n\n1. What works?\n\nIt may be rare that the World Health Organization and experts on the right and left in the U.S. see the same solutions to a problem, but that\u2019s the case when it comes to reopening the economy in the face of COVID-19. The principles are simple: Stabilize the number of people who have the virus (through the strict social distancing measures already in place), and ensure hospitals can handle the cases they have. Then, put tools in place to stop new infections in their tracks so there isn\u2019t a renewed outbreak.\n\nIt all starts with testing, and several countries that revamped their public health programs in the wake of the deadly 2003 SARS or 2015 MERS epidemics seem to be reaping the benefits now. That includes Singapore, which quickly ramped up testing for both active infections of COVID-19 and an antibody test to show previous infection, and South Korea, which tested tens of thousands of people in the weeks after it detected its first cases.\n\nSouth Korea, like many other Asian countries, is also relying on hundreds of workers armed with phone location data, credit card information and security footage to try to reach everyone who has come into contact with an infected person. Authorities release detailed information to the public whenever someone infected has been in their area. Though South Korea and Singapore reported a recent surge in cases imported from abroad, both countries have seen far more moderate economic and health fallouts than has the U.S.\n\nPolitically and culturally, European nations make for an easier comparison with the U.S. Germany not only deployed widespread testing early on, but it also has sent health teams to people\u2019s homes to check for symptoms and initiate aggressive interventions if symptoms arise.\n\nItaly, which has had more than six times the deaths of China despite having less than 5 percent of its population, has lessons for the U.S. as well \u2014 and not all grim.\n\nThe scenes from Lombardy, where doctors have rationed care for weeks, making decisions about who lives and who dies, are bleak. But neighboring Veneto, which found its first case of the virus on the same day as Lombardy, is faring much better, said Dr. Nancy Binkin, a professor at the University of California San Diego who spent 12 of her 20 years at the CDC embedded in Italy\u2019s public health system.\n\nBinkin and colleagues suspect the difference lies in the extensive use of public health tools to contain the initial outbreak in Veneto. That included testing nearly everyone in the town of V\u00f2 where the first cases were found, quarantining that city, and making heavy use of assistenti sanitari, or health assistants, to track down people with the virus and make sure they stay isolated.\n\nThere have been far fewer infected health workers in Veneto, and deaths overall, than in Lombardy, which is renowned for the quality of its hospitals and health care.\n\nWhat the places with fewer cases have in common is not just social distancing measures, said Binkin, but also aggressive tactics to identify and isolate people with the virus.\n\n2. How does the U.S. compare?\n\nU.S. public health budgets and staff have hemorrhaged over the years, accompanied by a steady stream of warning calls that the U.S. was not ready to face a pandemic.\n\nWhen COVID-19 arrived, identifying and tracking everyone with the virus was all but impossible for local health departments because of flawed tests and narrow guidelines for who should get tested. Compounding the problem was a beleaguered public health infrastructure.\n\nThe stay-at-home orders are largely about slowing the spread of the virus \u2014 to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed \u2014 not necessarily about preventing cases, said Adia Benton, an anthropologist at Northwestern University who studies inequalities in global health. Mobilizing a massive workforce to isolate everyone with the virus could prevent infections, Benton said. \u201cThe interventions we see reflect what we value,\u201d she said.\n\nPublic health is run locally, and health departments have different resources and organization. They are also confronting different degrees of outbreak.\n\nIn Tennessee, front-line health workers still are contact tracing everyone who gets the virus. To do so, many employees are working seven days a week, 12 hours a day, said Dr. Mary-Margaret Fill, a physician and epidemiologist with the state who is helping coordinate its emergency response. \u201cThey are the internal cog in this response; without them we fall apart,\u201d she said.\n\nIn California, public health is the responsibility of counties, and resources vary wildly. Many, including Sacramento and Orange counties, moved away from contact tracing weeks ago, citing minimal access to testing and a surge in cases. (A lack of testing is one thing nearly all health departments have in common.)\n\nEven San Francisco, with its abundant wealth and renowned expertise in HIV, was relying on a skeleton staff to track routine communicable diseases like measles, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases, according to the city and county\u2019s health officer, Dr. Tom\u00e1s Arag\u00f3n.\n\nLos Angeles County, with its 4,000 public health employees, is still doing some contact tracing for every person who tests positive, said Dr. Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. Rural Tulare County is trying to do the same, but has pinpointed the need for more people to trace cases as its greatest hurdle.\n\nThose techniques matter everywhere. \u201cSocial distancing, contact tracing, identification, quarantine and isolation. We need all of those tools,\u201d said Ferrer.\n\n3. How do we ramp up?\n\nExperts say the situation necessitates, at least temporarily, adding thousands of people to the ranks of public health. Three former Obama administration officials called for a \u201cpublic health firefighting force\u201d via a program like AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps.\n\nOthers suggest we make use of programs already in place. The Medical Reserve Corps program, a national network of volunteer medical and public health professionals, has 175,000 volunteers, some of whom have already been deployed to state health departments, said Biesiadecki. That program could be expanded.\n\n\u201cWe need a Marshall Plan. We need a New Deal. We need a WPA for public health,\u201d said Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale epidemiologist who won a MacArthur Fellowship for his work on global health and justice.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t necessarily require M.D.s, Ph.D.s or even public health degrees. In many countries, governments have trained community health workers in situations like these.\n\nBut in the absence of a federal program, some local departments in the U.S. are already taking up the cause. San Francisco, for example, is planning to recruit around 160 people to keep tabs on people diagnosed with the virus. Arag\u00f3n said he hopes to repurpose staff from within the county where possible, and hire where necessary.\n\n\u201cWe started off with a scarcity mentality,\u201d Arag\u00f3n said. \u201cWe have to have an abundance mentality. The amount of money that\u2019s being lost economically, if we put just a fraction of that into our public health workforce, we could get the economy back up and running.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts asked the global health nonprofit Partners in Health to help it hire 1,000 people to carry out mass contact tracing.\n\nIn Connecticut, Yale University faculty said they realized the state had the capacity to contact trace only in Fairfield County, a wealthy bedroom community of New York, leaving few resources for much poorer New Haven, where the university is located. So they recruited more than 100 public health, nursing and medical students, said Dr. Sten Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health. The volunteers were trained online by the state and, working alongside university staff, have been doing contact tracing for the local hospital.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t think these volunteer efforts are the solution. Vermund called it \u201cthe definition of insanity\u201d if the U.S. didn\u2019t take this moment to reinvest in public health. \u201cThere is no greater threat to the economic well-being of planet Earth,\u201d he said, \u201cthan pandemic respiratory viral illness.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.", "author": ["Anna Maria Barry-Jester"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-did-the-world-shut-down-for-covid-19-but-not-ebola-sars-or-swine-flu/", "published": "2020-04-14T11:00:36", "title": "Why Did The World Shut Down For COVID-19 But Not Ebola, SARS Or Swine Flu?", "text": "When reports of a new virus circulating in China\u2019s Hubei province first began to emerge, I was cautious about overreacting.

We\u2019re currently battling a global pandemic unlike any we\u2019ve seen in over a century.\n\n[Related: Why COVID-19 Models Are So Hard, A Comic Strip]\n\nBut it\u2019s also not the first modern virus we\u2019ve faced. In the past two decades, the world battled Ebola, SARS and more than one major flu outbreak. Those left tragedies in their wake but didn\u2019t cause the same level of societal and economic disruption that COVID-19 has. As a result, they can help us understand this new coronavirus \u2014 to capture how unique our new reality is, it helps to look back at similar outbreaks that threatened to upend society, but ultimately stopped short.\n\nSARS and MERS: Deadly, but not easily spread\n\nIn late 2002, an emerging pathogen that likely spilled over from the animal world started to cause severe respiratory illness in China. Sound familiar? Through the first half of 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spread through 26 countries, infecting at least 8,098 people and killing at least 774.\n\nIf the name didn\u2019t give it away, SARS was caused by a virus similar to the one that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, but it didn\u2019t have nearly the same impact. This is in spite of having a relatively high case fatality rate of 9.6 percent, compared to the current estimate for COVID-19: 1.4 percent.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight\n\nAnother respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, has an even higher case fatality rate of 34 percent. But it\u2019s also led to fewer deaths than what we\u2019ve already seen from COVID-19: As of January 2020, there have been 2,519 cases of MERS and 866 associated deaths from the infection.\n\nSARS and MERS didn\u2019t cause the same level of devastation that COVID-19 has largely because they aren\u2019t as easily transmitted. Rather than moving by casual, person-to-person transmission, SARS and MERS spread from much closer contact, between family members or health care workers and patients (or, in the case of MERS, from camels to people directly). These viruses also aren\u2019t spread through presymptomatic transmission, meaning infected people don\u2019t spread it before they have symptoms. Once people got sick, they typically stayed home or were hospitalized, making it harder for them to spread the virus around.\n\n\u201cBy and large, except for a couple of mass transmission events, almost all of the transmission of SARS was within the health care setting, when you have an aerosol-generating event like intubating someone or dialysis,\u201d said Stephen Morse, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. \u201cSo basically, you could control SARS by improving infection control and prevention in the hospitals.\u201d\n\n[Related: New York\u2019s Inequalities Are Fueling COVID-19]\n\nThis differs significantly from COVID-19, which can be spread by people without symptoms (whether those people go on to develop symptoms eventually, or are entirely asymptomatic throughout their infection, is not yet known). It also spreads easily from person to person. Put together, that means that people who don\u2019t know they\u2019re infectious could still be out and about, and their casual interactions are enough to spread the virus to other people. This is why social distancing has become such a crucial part of our strategy to combat the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nSwine flu: Easily spread, but not as deadly\n\nIn the spring of 2009, a new version of the H1N1 influenza virus \u2014 the virus that caused the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic \u2014 emerged and began to spread rapidly. The swine flu killed anywhere from 151,700 to 575,400 people worldwide in its first 12 months, through April 2010, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and may have infected over 1 billion by the end of 2010.\n\nThe swine flu spread easily person-to-person, just like COVID-19, and possibly even from people who were presymptomatic. Its R0, or R-naught, a measure of how many people an infectious person could infect, is between 1.4 and 1.6. This is a little lower than COVID-19, which experts estimate has a R-naught of between 1.5 and 3.5, but it still means H1N1 is a very infectious virus.\n\nSo why didn\u2019t the swine flu overwhelm our health care systems and grind our economies to a halt? The main difference is that it ended up being a much milder and less deadly infection. There are a range of estimated case fatality rates for swine flu, but even the highest, less than 0.1 percent, are much lower than the current estimates for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe 2009 pandemic, the H1N1 swine flu, that [disease] spread very, very well, but the fatality rate was quite low, and that\u2019s the reason why it wasn\u2019t dubbed as a particularly serious pandemic,\u201d said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force, in a February livestream.\n\nEven with such a low case fatality rate, the swine flu had a high overall death toll due in part to how easily it spread. With an even higher case fatality rate and perhaps even a higher rate of transmission, COVID-19 has required drastic measures to prevent its spread.\n\nEbola: Very severe, but hard to contract\n\nEbola first emerged in 1976, and the world has weathered outbreaks at various points since then, including one in West Africa from 2014 to 2016. It\u2019s a severe disease that kills, on average, 50 percent of people who become infected, according to the World Health Organization. Yet just over 11,000 people died during the 2014-2016 outbreak, which was largely isolated to the region where it emerged.\n\n[Related: How Close Are We To A COVID-19 Vaccine?]\n\nSimilar to MERS and SARS, Ebola is not easily transmittable. Infected people don\u2019t spread the virus until they start showing symptoms, and even then the virus is hard to catch because it is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluid of an infected person, like blood, sweat, and urine, rather than through the kind of particles produced when someone sneezes or speaks. Unless you\u2019re nursing patients (either at home or in a hospital setting) or tending to their body after they\u2019ve died, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019d acquire the infection.\n\nEbola also tends to cause pretty severe and identifiable symptoms, such as fever and fatigue followed by vomiting and diarrhea. Not only can infected people not spread the virus until they\u2019re sick, but once they become sick, they\u2019ll know it.\n\n\u201cIf you want to see illnesses which are controllable, they all have transmission very much tied to symptoms, and this includes SARS and Ebola,\u201d said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cIf you\u2019re in an Ebola zone, you can be pretty sure whether or not the person you\u2019re talking to is a potentially risky contact.\u201d\n\nThis makes it easier to isolate infected individuals and protect health care workers to limit the spread, which is what occurred in the 2014-2016 outbreak. It\u2019s a striking difference from COVID-19, which we know can be spread without any symptoms at all, and even when people get sick, some people might have symptoms so mild that they\u2019re not sure they have COVID-19 in the first place.\n\nIn each of these cases, the viral outbreak lacked one of the key components that COVID-19 has that allowed it to tip over into a global pandemic. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 is kind of a perfect storm,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University who specializes in infectious diseases.\n\n[Related: The COVID-19 Blame Game Is Going To Get Uglier]\n\nCOVID-19 can be mild enough that some people who have it don\u2019t know they have it. It\u2019s also easily spread, can be transmitted by presymptomatic people and is severe enough to kill a significant share of those who have it. All combined, the novel coronavirus has led to an outbreak that is unusually difficult to track and control. The seismic shift in our everyday lives is happening for a reason.\n\nCORRECTION (April 15, 9:40 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people who died from swine flu since 2009. Between 151,700 and 575,400 people died in the first 12 months after the virus emerged; that range does not include all deaths since 2009. The article has also been updated to make clear that the swine flu infected over 1 billion people by the end of 2010 \u2014 again, that does not include all infections since 2009.\n\nIs social distancing in the US \u2018flattening the curve\u2019?", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-comic-strip-tour-of-the-wild-world-of-pandemic-modeling/", "published": "2020-04-13T14:58:27", "title": "A Comic Strip Tour Of The Wild World Of Pandemic Modeling", "text": "Send to Email Address\n\nYour Name\n\nYour Email Address\n\nPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\n\nEmail check failed, please try again\n\nSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.", "author": ["Zach Weinersmith", "Maggie Koerth", "Laura Bronner", "Jasmine Mithani"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/wealth-and-race-have-always-divided-new-york-covid-19-has-only-made-things-worse/", "published": "2020-04-10T17:29:23", "title": "New York\u2019s Inequalities Are Fueling COVID-19", "text": "Dr. Royal S. Copeland, the field marshal in New York City\u2019s battle against the 1918 influenza epidemic, knew his enemy was more than just a virus. As health commissioner, he oversaw a medical crisis that would eventually kill some 30,000 New Yorkers over three waves of the disease. In Copeland\u2019s estimation, the problem was not only influenza but also the city\u2019s crowded tenements and endemic poverty.\n\nTo modern eyes, the measures he took to stymie the spread might seem strange. In an extensive interview with The New York Times after the first wave of influenza had passed, Copeland touted the decision not to close New York\u2019s public schools. It was, he reasoned, best to keep them open to give the city\u2019s children respite from crowded apartments and, if need be, a point of access to the medical system. \u201cWe have practically 1,000,000 children in the public schools, about 750,000 of them from tenement homes. These homes are frequently unsanitary and crowded,\u201d he said. \u201cThe children\u2019s parents are occupied with the manifold duties involved in keeping the wolf from the door. No matter how loving they may be \u2014 and, of course, they are just as loving as any parents anywhere \u2014 they simply have not the time to give the necessary attention to the initial symptoms of disease.\u201d\n\nEven under normal circumstances, living in New York City requires a certain surrender of personal space: Subways are packed, apartments are small and bodegas get cramped with after-work shoppers. But not all New Yorkers have to live in a stressful crowd all the time, a fact the COVID-19 pandemic has laid all too bare. The city\u2019s wealth inequality has always been apparent: financial safety nets, Whole Foods delivery and routine access to health care. But the pandemic has added a new layer to what affluence can afford some New Yorkers, including routine access to personal space and the flexibility that white-collar work allows. While over 100 years have gone by since the 1918 pandemic, some of Copeland\u2019s worries about the difficult nature of city life \u2014 and the inequities of who lives the most comfortably \u2014 remain chillingly relevant.\n\nWe know already that the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting people of color more than white Americans. While the virus stalks the rich and poor \u2014 leading some to call it \u201cthe great equalizer\u201d \u2014 those with lesser means have fewer places to hide from it. Dr. Andrew Goodman, a professor of public health at New York University who used to work for the city\u2019s Health Promotion and Disease Prevention unit, pointed to the pandemic as \u201ca more dramatic example of the health-inequity side of income inequality and racial inequality in the U.S.\u201d Deaths from diseases that disproportionately affect minority communities, like diabetes and hypertension, \u201cusually get spread out over time, and it doesn\u2019t seem as dramatic,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cThis is a more accelerated version.\u201d\n\nWhile there is a lot of uncertainty about the actual numbers of those infected \u2014 only a fraction of people who show symptoms are tested, so the rate of infection is almost certainly higher than what\u2019s being reported \u2014 life in two New York City ZIP codes, one working class and one wealthy, gives us a glimpse into different ways of city living that might mean life or death in today\u2019s New York.\n\nAccording to a running ProPublica tally of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases, the ZIP codes with the highest rate of infection are in a certain corner of Queens: East Elmhurst. One East Elmhurst ZIP code, 11370, is home to the notorious Rikers Island correctional facility, and has the highest recorded positive test rate in New York City \u2014 127 percent worse than the city\u2019s average. Jails like Rikers have become hotbeds for spreading the disease given their space constraints \u2014 well over 600 inmates and workers are infected with the virus at Rikers. East Elmhurst\u2019s other, non-Rikers ZIP code, 11369, is a residential neighborhood and has the second worst positive test rate in the city, 121 percent greater than the average.\n\nEast Elmhurst has seen a high rate of individuals tested, and that might be in part because Elmhurst Hospital in neighboring Elmhurst, Queens \u2014 \u201cthe epicenter within the epicenter,\u201d in the words of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2014 has set up a testing tent outside the hospital. According to 2018 data from the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey, 34,118 people live in the 1.1 square miles of East Elmhurst\u2019s 11369 ZIP code. Sixty-four percent of its residents are Latino, and the median household income is $54,121, three-quarters of the median income in New York\u2019s greater metro area. On the neighborhood\u2019s northern border is LaGuardia Airport, and south of that are mosques and diners, a baseball field and blocks and blocks of houses cramped together. On those cramped blocks, the average household size is 3.2 people, 20 percent above the city average.\n\nNearly 11 percent of all households in ZIP code 11369 are also multigenerational, with three or more generations living under the same roof. It\u2019s possible that the grouping of young and old together in one house could have something to do with higher infection rates. Researchers are still unclear about how many others a person infects when they have the virus, but early estimates were around 2 to 2.5 people. The elderly are more susceptible, and in Italy, doctors believe that the country\u2019s culture of intergenerational living and familial closeness has had disastrous effects during the pandemic; Italy\u2019s rate of death from COVID-19 is among the highest in the world.\n\nUnderlying conditions like asthma tend to be more prevalent in crowded environments, according to Dr. Y. Claire Wang, who specializes in public health and chronic disease prevention at the New York Academy of Medicine. The respiratory condition puts individuals at greater risk for COVID-19 complications, and households in city apartments with pests or mold, common problems in public housing units, often have higher rates of asthma, she said.\n\nThings look different on the other side of the positive test rate list. ZIP code 11215 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, has among the city\u2019s lowest rates of COVID-19, at 56 percent below average. Park Slope is a different New York from East Elmhurst in many ways. Two-thirds of its population is white, and at $123,583, the median household income is one and a half times greater than that of the average in New York\u2019s greater metropolitan area. The neighborhood is named for its proximity to one of the city\u2019s largest green spaces, Prospect Park, and it\u2019s known for its gracious brownstones and tree-lined streets. The average household size in Park Slope is 2.4 people, and only 1.8 percent of households are multigenerational.\n\nThe racial and ethnic differences between Park Slope and East Elmhurst might prove particularly important as both neighborhoods weather the pandemic. Early statistical reports on the disease are already painting a picture of racial inequity. Earlier this week New York State released preliminary numbers that showed Latinos have the highest rate of COVID-19 fatality in New York City.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation report on initial pandemic data reveals that minorities are bearing the brunt of infection and death from the virus in many places. Higher rates of chronic conditions in minorities put them at greater risk for serious complications from COVID-19. In Washington, D.C., where black residents make up 45 percent of the total population, they account for 29 percent of confirmed cases and 59 percent of deaths. In Michigan, black residents are 14 percent of the population, but represent 33 percent of confirmed cases and 41 percent of deaths.\n\n\u201cWe say something as simple as \u2018your ZIP code should not define your health\u2019 \u2014 [but] in New York City, that\u2019s often the story,\u201d said Dr. Torian Easterling, the deputy commissioner of the Center for Health Equity and Community Wellness, a city agency that addresses racial and social inequities in health. He pointed to high rates of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and a lack of access to healthy foods in minority communities as long-standing public health problems that have only been exacerbated by the onset of COVID-19.\n\nDuring the 1918 pandemic, the white population had a higher rate of infection, according to a 2007 study of the outbreak by Thomas A. Garrett, then an economist at the St. Louis Federal Reserve. But that, Garrett surmised, had to do with the fact that the black population in the U.S. was still largely rural; the pandemic was a particular menace to cities. \u201c[T]he nonwhite population in the United States has become much more urban. \u2026 A modern-day pandemic may result in greater nonwhite mortality rates because a greater percentage of the nonwhite population in the United States lives in urban areas,\u201d he wrote. Census estimates from 2019 show that the majority of New York City residents are people of color.\n\nPark Slope and the East Elmhurst ZIP code of 11369 are similarly dense, with roughly 32,000 and 31,000 people per square mile, respectively. But life in the neighborhoods is different in other ways that might contribute to their divergent rates of apparent COVID-19 infection. According to the latest Census Bureau count, the most prevalent jobs in East Elmhurst are clerical work, food service and construction. In Park Slope, management, entertainment, education and business are the most common professions. The typical East Elmhurst worker is required to leave home to perform their job, while the lines of work most common in Park Slope are adaptable to teleworking. And Latinos \u2014 East Elmhurst\u2019s dominant ethnic group \u2014 are more likely than all other Americans to consider COVID-19 a threat to their financial stability, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen how socioeconomic circumstances can correlate with Americans\u2019 ability to stay at home. A recent New York Times analysis of anonymized cellphone data tracked the movements of Americans and found that those in the top 10 percent income bracket have limited their movements more than those in the bottom 10 percent. What Copeland said in 1918 could very likely still hold true: \u201cI have no doubt that the most dangerous means of transmitting disease was the subway. \u2026 Many a man who was sick must have felt that he had to go to work.\u201d\n\nCopeland\u2019s struggle against the currents of poverty and influenza would continue into 1920. Updating the public on the state of the epidemic, which had reemerged, Copeland told The New York Times that the health department was working to stop the eviction of tenants during the outbreak and described the struggle to attract nurses to the city\u2019s hospitals, since wealthy individuals were offering them higher pay to work in private homes. He pleaded for better ventilation on subways and buses and criticized coffin-makers who were price-gouging the city\u2019s residents. Even in death, New York was unrelenting.\n\nAnd so it remains today. Early this week, the city announced that hospital morgues around New York were overflowing with the dead. An Associated Press report painted a grim picture of one Brooklyn hospital. Even with an infection rate much lower than those in Queens, \u201cmounds of corpses\u201d had become so difficult to navigate that hospital staff were stepping over them.\n\nThe great equalizer isn\u2019t COVID-19 \u2014 it\u2019s death. But in New York\u2019s epidemic, death attends to the haves and have-nots differently: For the city\u2019s poor, it hovers closely, and when it comes, it leaves them as crowded as ever.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Clare Malone"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-close-are-we-to-a-covid-19-vaccine/", "published": "2020-04-10T16:26:30", "title": "How Close Are We To A COVID-19 Vaccine?", "text": "A vaccine for COVID-19 has entered Phase 1 of clinical trials in Seattle.

A recent report from the CDC found that as of March 28, only about half of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were over 65, while three-quarters of hospitalized patients of all ages had at least one underlying condition.\n\nWe analyzed the CDC\u2019s 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, a collection of health-related surveys of U.S. residents, to see just how many Americans are more vulnerable to getting seriously ill from COVID-19 and what demographic groups they fall into. Some of the most striking findings:\n\nAccording to the data, more than 135 million American adults, or 52 percent, are somehow at elevated risk.\n\nAbout three-fifths of those who are vulnerable are under 65.\n\nYounger black Americans are more likely to be vulnerable. The percentage of white Americans who are over 65 is higher than the share of black Americans in that age group, but among those under 65, a larger percentage of black Americans have underlying conditions.\n\nThe poorest and least educated Americans are more likely to be at risk than those with higher incomes or more education. More than 60 percent of those who make less than $25,000 a year and those who did not complete high school have an underlying condition that makes them vulnerable.\n\nSo to better understand the threat Americans are confronting, let\u2019s dive deeper into the data.\n\n2 in 5 younger people are at elevated risk\n\nAlthough everyone over 65 is considered to be at higher risk whether or not they have underlying conditions, as you can see in the chart below, more than 30 percent of every age group is at risk. Overall, nearly 40 percent of all Americans under 65 have a condition that makes COVID-19 more dangerous for them.\n\nSimilar percentages of white and black Americans are at high risk (56 percent and 54 percent, respectively), but white Americans are more likely than other racial groups to be at risk because of their age, as you can see below. Some of the most at-risk groups are multiracial and black Americans under 65.\n\nThe pandemic preys on existing inequalities\n\nDavid Williams, a professor at Harvard\u2019s T. H. Chan School of Public Health who studies how social factors like race and socioeconomic status affect health, said that people of color are more likely to develop conditions like heart disease and diabetes than white Americans, and to develop those conditions at a younger age than white people do.\n\nThese disparities extend to whether people are getting regular health care, too. For example, the CDC\u2019s risk factor survey estimates that almost 16 percent of black Americans \u2014 4.8 million people in total \u2014 did not see a doctor when they needed one at some point in the 12 months prior to taking the survey because they couldn\u2019t afford to go. Among Latinos, that number jumped to almost 20 percent, while around 17 percent of Native Americans and multiracial Americans reported forgoing needed care. In contrast, 10 percent of whites and 9 percent of Asian Americans didn\u2019t see a doctor because of cost concerns. And that makes sense, because black Americans were also almost twice as likely to lack health insurance as white Americans, and Hispanic Americans were nearly four times as likely.\n\nThe reasons for these disparities are well documented. Pervasive residential segregation puts people of color at a disadvantage, differences in employment and education opportunities exacerbate poverty, communities of color have fewer health resources and less access to fresh food, and for decades, alcohol, tobacco and junk food companies have targeted advertising to black and Hispanic communities.\n\nWilliams also pointed to a comprehensive study of how people of color experience the health care system. The study suggested that at least partly due to providers\u2019 implicit bias, black, Hispanic and Native American patients can receive lower quality health care.\n\n\u201cThe science is 100 percent clear on this point and that is, across virtually every therapeutic intervention in the United States, from the most simple procedure to the most complicated, blacks and other minorities receive poorer quality care and less intensive care than whites,\u201d he said.\n\nThe working class faces higher risk\n\nBecause of how race and class are intertwined in American life, you can also see health inequalities along socioeconomic lines. In general, Williams said, \u201cSocioeconomic status is one of the biggest predictors of variations in health in the world.\u201d Almost two-thirds of those who make less than $25,000 have underlying conditions that make them more vulnerable to the novel coronavirus, and, as you can see in the chart below, the likelihood of having those conditions declines as incomes go up. And these numbers just look at respondents\u2019 health \u2014 they don\u2019t take into account what jobs these people do or whether those jobs are requiring workers to interact with the public and increase their risk of exposure.\n\nSimilarly, about 63 percent of Americans who did not graduate from high school are more vulnerable, while about 40 percent of college graduates have health issues that put them at increased risk.\n\nThe differences among income, education and racial groups reflect that those with more resources have better access to health care and more of the flexibility that makes healthy lifestyle changes possible (such as exercising or buying fresh fruits and vegetables).\n\nIn this pandemic, Williams said that those who were already disadvantaged will likely be hit hardest, as businesses close down and leave many low-income black and Hispanic workers out of a job, causing financial hardship even in the best of circumstances and making it even harder to see a doctor if they do get sick.\n\n\u201cI think we are looking at a perfect storm that can have pervasive adverse consequences. The people being most hurt by this epidemic are the very people who at the beginning of this epidemic were the most vulnerable,\u201d he said.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Likhitha Butchireddygari", "Anna Wiederkehr"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/experts-think-were-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-but-hospitalizations-havent-peaked-yet/", "published": "2020-04-09T15:06:53", "title": "Experts Think We\u2019re Flattening The Coronavirus Curve, But Hospitalizations Haven\u2019t Peaked Yet", "text": "Predictions of the coronavirus\u2019s toll on the U.S. continue to fluctuate. Though some states report evidence of a flattening in the curve, others are just beginning to see COVID-19\u2019s devastation. To get a better picture of how the pandemic will play out, we\u2019re following a survey of infectious-disease researchers from institutions across the country. This is our fourth week tracking the survey, which captures experts\u2019 thoughts on the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their estimates of its future trajectory and the uncertainty surrounding its future.\n\nThis week\u2019s survey, taken on April 6 and 7, shows that experts expect about 660,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases on April 12, indicating that they see the coronavirus spread as likely slowing. However, they think hospitalizations are most likely to peak in May, with a 42 percent chance that they won\u2019t peak until after June 1. The experts also believe that only 13 percent of all infections in the U.S. had been reported on April 5, implying that there could have been up to 20.2 million people currently infected at the time.\n\nFor most questions in the survey, respondents are asked to provide their best estimate, as well as a best-case and worst-case possibility. Asking a question in this way lets the survey organizers generate a consensus forecast, which is a tool that combines the uncertainty of each individual response to produce the most likely outcome according to all the experts, as well as a possible range of outcomes.\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts had to say this week.\n\nWhat is the smallest, most likely and largest number of total cases that The COVID Tracking Project will report on April 12?\n\nAmong the experts, there was a large spread in the projected number of cases that will be reported on April 12, as well as in each expert\u2019s uncertainty surrounding those estimates.\n\nThe individual expert uncertainties are also reflected in the consensus forecast, which projects anywhere between 500,000 and 1.2 million total cases reported on April 12, with 660,000 being the most likely number.\n\nThe experts have made these one-week projections in the past three surveys, and the actual recorded case counts have fallen comfortably within their confidence intervals.\n\nNext week\u2019s case estimates indicate that the experts think the spread of the virus is likely to slow in the U.S., although there\u2019s no guarantee of that if the case count falls near the top end of next week\u2019s range.\n\nOf the next six months, which month will see the most COVID-19 hospitalizations in the U.S.?\n\nAlthough the experts think the spread of COVID-19 is likely to slow down in the coming weeks, they still think hospitalizations are most likely to peak in May, and the expert consensus gives a 42 percent chance that hospitalizations won\u2019t peak until after June 1.\n\nThis wide consensus distribution \u2014 with April, May and June each given a chance of more than 20 percent of containing the hospitalization peak \u2014 illustrates the uncertainty among the experts in assessing the trajectory of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe can project how things will go if we continue the same physical distancing measures we have in place now,\u201d said Mary Bushman, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University\u2019s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. \u201cBut the actual future trajectory depends massively on what society does going forward, and that is still unknown.\u201d\n\nWhen will the daily number of new hospital COVID-19 admissions in New York City drop below 200?\n\nThe last time new daily hospitalizations in New York City were below 200 was on March 15, according to the New York City Health Department, and as recently as April 3, there were more than 1,000 new hospitalizations in New York City.\n\nAnd although new hospitalizations have been falling in recent days, experts think there\u2019s a 2 in 3 chance that new daily hospitalizations won\u2019t fall below 200 again until after May 1.\n\nBushman said new hospitalizations will probably peak in New York City before they peak in the rest of the country, but there\u2019s no guarantee. \u201cNew York City is weeks into the surge of hospitalizations, whereas the rest of the country is only just starting or hasn\u2019t started yet,\u201d they said. \u201cBut if the city goes through periods of physical distancing interspersed with periods of relative normalcy, we could even see multiple peaks.\u201d\n\nFinally, the experts think that only 13 percent of all COVID-19 infections in the U.S. had been reported by April 5, and up to 20.2 million people may have been infected at the time.\n\nThe number of new cases may be starting to slow for now, but there\u2019s still a great deal of uncertainty in the overall trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCORRECTION (April 9, 2020, 1:37 p.m.): A previous version of the chart of case count forecasts in this article showed an incorrectly spaced y-axis.

We can\u2019t accurately track the disease\u2019s toll in real time, nor can we accurately predict where it\u2019s headed. We are told that developing a vaccine will take 18 months \u2014 which seems excruciatingly slow \u2014 and that the only truly effective weapon we have for now is widespread social distancing, which, of course, has its own painful economic side effects. We always believed our modern tools would protect us from catastrophe, but they have proven startlingly inadequate against this invisible enemy.\n\nIn some ways at least, technology has been able to tell us more about how and where the virus is spreading. Mostly, this has involved creatively harnessing the power of big data \u2014 using temperature readings from smart thermometers to detect COVID-19 hot spots, or aggregating cellphone location data to point to the areas of the country where people are staying home. But against a backdrop of debate between civil liberties and public health, we also need to be asking where the line is digitally: How much surveillance is acceptable in the service of the greater good?\n\nTo be clear, the types of data being tracked now are usually anonymized, aggregated in large groups according to, say, geography. They are also collected with the consent of users. But long before the new coronavirus emerged, critics of big tech companies were already pointing out that users typically give such consent through labyrinthine terms-of-service agreements, often not knowing what their data would ultimately be used for. In today\u2019s world, data is an extremely valuable commodity that rewards its collectors in many ways. Even as individual data profiles that provide search suggestions, traffic directions and health guidance help improve daily life, that goes hand in hand with more nefarious motives companies might have for recording user activities.\n\nAgain, those were the worries being raised prior to the pandemic. Now, COVID-19 has revealed much starker trade-offs between personal privacy and the collective benefits of technology. In South Korea, for example, the ability to retrace an infected person\u2019s steps using credit card transactions and cellphone tracking data is part of the country\u2019s (largely successful) response to the virus. Other countries are also ramping up digital surveillance at an individual level in the name of public health. Although such measures may seem less likely to be used in the U.S., one recent Harris poll showed that a sizable, bipartisan majority of Americans would favor a public coronavirus registry and be willing to share phone location data to get alerts about infected people being nearby.\n\nThese efforts might seem appealing because they represent an effective use of technology against a threat we\u2019re struggling to otherwise control. If less aggressive tracking \u2014 such as the aforementioned smart-thermometer data \u2014 has been useful in measuring the effects of social-distancing policies, even stronger versions have the potential to assist in contact tracing and ultimately help contain the virus for good. If we can bring the power of our growing data-collection apparatus to bear in the fight against COVID-19, shouldn\u2019t we?\n\n\u201cThis is a genuine emergency, and that justifies a lot of things that would not normally be justified,\u201d Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, told Bloomberg. \u201cBut we have to make sure that these temporary powers do not become permanent in a way that hurts everybody else.\u201d\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, this tension between safety and freedom is playing out across more than just the technology space. Because a patchwork of policies are being implemented largely at the state level, the rules around actions like quarantines \u2014 and their constitutional enforceability \u2014 are somewhat open-ended. \u201cRight now, between states, there are different protocols in terms of how to handle something that might be a health crisis such as this,\u201d said University of California, Irvine School of Law professor Michele Goodwin on a recent episode of Slate\u2019s \u201cAmicus\u201d podcast. \u201cThere isn\u2019t necessarily coherence in terms of states\u2019 laws. There isn\u2019t any coherence vis-a-vis state and federal law in this domain.\u201d\n\nBut Goodwin stressed the need to maintain individual protections even in the face of an extraordinary crisis. \u201cOur civil liberties don\u2019t just simply go away because there is a virus that is afoot that might affect many people,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t lose your civil liberties simply because there is something in the air. You don\u2019t lose your civil liberties simply because you become sick. It\u2019s important to understand the primacy of due process.\u201d\n\nSo what does a policy that balances data privacy and the public good look like? \u201cWe ask three questions about proposals to use data about people in new ways in response to COVID-19,\u201d Adam Schwartz, a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told me over email. \u201cWould it be effective? Would it excessively intrude on our liberties? Are there sufficient safeguards?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome proposals would not be effective \u2014 e.g., use of cell-site location information for contact tracing, because it is not sufficiently granular to place two people close enough together to transmit the disease,\u201d Schwartz wrote. \u201cSome proposals would excessively intrude on our liberties \u2014 e.g., China\u2019s compulsion that every resident download a tracking app. [But] some forms of aggregated data might be a tolerable way to inform decision-making about the outbreak, provided [there are] sufficient safeguards to protect privacy.\u201d\n\nBecause the coronavirus has been so difficult to stop, it\u2019s tempting to fight it by whatever means are available \u2014 and there\u2019s a case to be made for that, at least temporarily. (After all, the whole concept of flattening the curve is about giving up freedom of movement and activity in order to save lives.) But it\u2019s important to also remember that individual rights ceded during a crisis rarely return, even when that crisis subsides.\n\n\u201cWe are very troubled by the historical precedent that new powers given to government in times of crisis tend to stay in place,\u201d Schwartz told me. \u201cTwo decades after the 9/11 attacks, the NSA [National Security Agency] is still engaged in dragnet internet surveillance. So before we support new forms of high-tech surveillance of personal data about location and health, we must think hard about whether the surveillance would actually be effective at solving the problem at hand. And even when the answer is yes, sometimes the impact on our liberties is intolerable.\u201d\n\nAnd as tech companies were already under fire for collecting too much data before COVID-19 \u2014 and officials were already interested in using that information \u2014 that means being wary of what kind of information they\u2019re able to gather, even if it offers creative ways to help combat the pandemic right now.\n\nWhy it\u2019s so hard to make a good COVID-19 model", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dr-fauci-has-been-dreading-a-pandemic-like-covid-19-for-years/", "published": "2020-04-07T19:01:41", "title": "Dr. Fauci Has Been Dreading A Pandemic Like COVID-19 For Years", "text": "Last year, before the COVID-19 pandemic created quarantines, surging unemployment and packed hospitals, I interviewed Dr. Anthony Fauci. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is now essentially omnipresent as part of the White House coronavirus task force. But in the spring of 2019, with COVID-19 nowhere on the horizon, he still had the time to speak with me for over an hour about vaccines. Recently, I was plumbing through my archives and found an excerpt of the interview that stopped me in my tracks.\n\nAt the time, with cases of measles on the rise, the anti-vaccination movement was one of the biggest ongoing public health stories. We spent most of the interview talking about vaccine safety for a video series I was making for The Washington Post. But at one point in our chat, I asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the thing that keeps you up at night?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know what I assumed Fauci would say, but his response couldn\u2019t have been more prescient.\n\n\u201cWell, I always say something semi-facetious when people ask me that. We worry about so many things when we\u2019re awake that we\u2019re so tired that nothing keeps us up at night. But notwithstanding that, the thing I\u2019m most concerned about as an infectious disease physician and as a public health person is the emergence of a new virus that the body doesn\u2019t have any background experience with, that is very transmissible, highly transmissible from person to person, and has a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Now what I\u2019ve essentially done is paint the picture of a pandemic influenza. Now it doesn\u2019t have to be influenza. It could be something like SARS. SARS was really quite scary. Thankfully, it kind of burned itself out by good public health measures. But the thing that worries most of us in the field of public health is a respiratory illness that can spread even before someone is so sick that you want to keep them in bed. And that\u2019s really the difference.\u201d\n\nAt the time, I didn\u2019t find this quote particularly earth-shattering. It seemed like a reasonable concern, but not newsworthy. After all, Americans have lived through multiple pandemic scares \u2014 SARS, MERS, swine flu \u2014 and we largely dodged each bullet. This part of the interview was off-topic for the series I was making, and I left it on the cutting room floor.\n\nReading the transcript almost a year later, I am struck by how clearly Fauci described this current pandemic. Our nation\u2019s top public health officials have known that this outbreak, or something like it, was a serious possibility, and they haven\u2019t been keeping this information to themselves. But it\u2019s hard to find the collective will to prepare for \u2014 and stop \u2014 a theoretical threat.

Face Masks Are No Exception.", "text": "Over the course of the last week, America somehow went from being a country where very few people were willing to wear masks for health \u2026 to one where regular people are trading mask-making patterns like sourdough starter.\n\nBut the messaging about mask usage remains muddled. That\u2019s true for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which updated its public recommendations to include wearing masks whenever you go out in public on the same day President Trump announced he would not be wearing one. It\u2019s also true in the scientific community, where dueling experts both urge widespread public face mask usage and dismiss face masks as useless and potentially dangerous.\n\nMeanwhile, those of us with sweet, loving mothers who like to craft their way through anxiety are rapidly accumulating stockpiles of homemade masks. (I currently have 10 masks, and I have been told that another boxful is on the way. Thanks, Mom!) So what are we \u2014 the suddenly cloth-mask-owning people of America \u2014 supposed to take away from this? Is it a good idea to wear a mask in public?\n\nThat\u2019s a trick question, experts told me. And we actually need to be asking something altogether different. \u201cI would say there\u2019s a lack of evidence to support either position,\u201d said Benjamin Cowling, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Hong Kong University. \u201cWhen we have a lack of scientific evidence, then we have to use our judgment on what might be the best thing to do and what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\n\nAnd judgment is subjective: It\u2019s influenced by personal experience, by how people view risks and benefits, and by how they weigh the balance between the two. Sometimes, we have to make big, serious decisions, even when research hasn\u2019t conveniently supplied us with absolute, unequivocal facts. We\u2019re in the land of uncertainty \u2014 a place that the novel coronavirus pandemic has forced us to visit a lot lately. Masks are just one part of it. And the question isn\u2019t, \u201cShould we wear them or not?\u201d It\u2019s, \u201cHow do we make a decision when there isn\u2019t an answer?\u201d\n\nUncertainty is hardly unfamiliar for people who work in public health. \u201cThat\u2019s a normal day in the life for most of us,\u201d said Lara S. Martin, a former program manager at Emory University\u2019s Center for Humanitarian Emergencies. She\u2019s done public health research in the field of humanitarian response for over a decade. But making life or death decisions in the face of big question marks is not the norm for millions of average Americans, who are struggling to understand everything from how long they should wash their hands to how many people are likely to die from the novel coronavirus this year.\n\nThe mask debate is part of that big picture of uncertainty. We just don\u2019t have data, even for the efficacy of medical-grade masks in protecting against the transmission of a fluid-based virus like Ebola. The more specific the question becomes \u2014 What about cloth masks? What\u2019s the best filter? How airborne is coronavirus, exactly? \u2014 the more hazy the data. There are studies on these issues, experts told me, but there\u2019s not enough data to be conclusive. About the best anyone can say is that, depending on several variables like the type of mask and how well it\u2019s used, there\u2019s probably a small benefit to wearing masks \u2014 in preventing the wearer from spreading the virus to others.\n\nBut that still leaves plenty of space for reasonable experts to reasonably disagree. Martin and Cowling come down on opposite ends of the face mask debate. Martin, who said she has watched misuse of masks and gloves spread disease in emergency situations, believes masks can create a false sense of security. After all, we know of other times where safety measures have led people to take more risks \u2014 not fewer.\n\nMeanwhile, Cowling \u2014 who said he has lived through multiple epidemics in Hong Kong and seen successive waves of public health campaigns improve the way the public uses masks \u2014 believes the very limited evidence of a small potential benefit to public health means it\u2019s worth doing. To him, the risks of wearing masks can be mitigated, and every small benefit stacks on top of the last.\n\n\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Why do it with no evidence?'\u201d Cowling said. \u201cAnd others are saying, \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t you do it if there\u2019s no evidence?\u2019\u201d\n\nSometimes \u2014 pretty often, actually, in medicine \u2014 people have to make decisions even when there isn\u2019t enough data to tell them what to do. There are even situations where finding more evidence can, itself, be harmful, said Michelle Driedger, professor of health sciences at the University of Manitoba. Take lower back pain, for instance. Faced with a patient who is in pain and wants to know what\u2019s wrong, a doctor might be tempted to order some kind of imaging test, she said. \u201cBut sometimes that\u2019s a soft tissue issue, where rest is better than exposing ourselves to X-rays, because they can\u2019t necessarily identify if there\u2019s really a problem, anyway,\u201d Driedger said.\n\nCommon sense doesn\u2019t always apply. And you have to be prepared to update your choices as more information comes in. Be prepared, in other words, to get comfortable without knowing the correct answer right now, and get comfortable with knowing your answer may change in the future. You also have to accept that changing your mind about how to fight the pandemic doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed. \u201cIt will change. This is just the way we learn and adapt,\u201d Martin said.\n\nAt the end of the day, experts told me, when evidence is lacking, individuals and public health officials alike have to make a call based on what we do know, our personal experiences and our own understanding of risk and risk management.\n\nCowling and Martin agree that if Americans start wearing masks, it\u2019s vitally important that they are explicitly taught how to use them. We\u2019ve gotten some helpful suggestions for how to make simple, cheap masks at home, which is crucial if we want to avoid encouraging people to snap up N95 masks that health care workers need.\n\nBut Cowling and Martin say Americans also need detailed information on how to make and wear masks in a way that maximizes the benefit to them and minimizes the risk. That\u2019s going to require videos, advertisements and an all-out push to teach and change behavior, they both said. Until that exists, Martin\u2019s advice is to imagine that, every time you use a mask, there\u2019s something really disgusting that\u2019s gotten on it and that it\u2019s plainly visible. \u201cIf you could see it, and it was gross, what would you do? You wouldn\u2019t touch it. You wouldn\u2019t wear it again. You\u2019d wash it in the hottest water you can with strong detergent. Some of that can help,\u201d she said.\n\nUltimately, the expert advice on masks (and hand-washing, and death tolls, and the proper distance to keep between yourself and others, and \u2026 and \u2026 and) is to get comfortable with not knowing the right answer. You can (and should) have some trusted advisors. You can (and should) read up on why certain things are or aren\u2019t being recommended. But there are a lot of issues around this virus on which two experts can read the same data and come to different conclusions.\n\nFor the rest of us, that means accepting that, sometimes, we\u2019ll just have to do the best we can without a clear set of instructions. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the best gifts we can give ourselves,\u201d Martin said.\n\nWhy it\u2019s so hard to make a good COVID-19 model", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/olympics-have-been-canceled-because-of-war-but-weve-never-seen-anything-like-this/", "published": "2020-04-06T15:40:57", "title": "Olympics Have Been Canceled Because Of War.

COVID-19 statistics, especially the number of reported cases, are not at all like that. The data, at best, is highly incomplete, and often the tip of the iceberg for much larger problems. And data on tests and the number of reported cases is highly nonrandom. In many parts of the world today, health authorities are still trying to triage the situation with a limited number of tests available. Their goal in testing is often to allocate scarce medical care to the patients who most need it \u2014 rather than to create a comprehensive dataset for epidemiologists and statisticians to study.\n\nBut if you\u2019re not accounting for testing patterns, it can throw your conclusions entirely out of whack. You don\u2019t just run the risk of being a little bit wrong: Your analysis could be off by an order of magnitude. Or even worse, you might be led in the opposite direction of what is actually happening. A country where the case count is increasing because it\u2019s doing more testing, for instance, might actually be getting its epidemic under control. Alternatively, in a country where the reported number of new cases is declining, the situation could actually be getting worse, either because its system is too overwhelmed to do adequate testing or because it\u2019s ramping down on testing for PR reasons.\n\nFailure to account for testing strategies can also render comparisons between states and countries meaningless. According to two recent epidemiological studies, which tried to infer the true number of infected people from the reported number of deaths, there is roughly a 20-fold difference in case detection rates between the countries that are doing the best job of it, such as Norway and the worst job, such as the United Kingdom. (The United States is probably somewhere in the middle of the pack by this standard.) That means, for example, that in one country that reports 1,000 COVID-19 cases, there could actually be 5,000 infected people, and in another country that reports 1,000 cases, there might be 100,000!\n\nThere is also a lot of uncertainty about the true numbers of infections within a given country. According to an expert survey published by FiveThirtyEight, the number of detected cases in the United States could underestimate the true number of infected people by anywhere from a multiple of two times to 100 times. The same holds in other countries. A recent paper published by Imperial College London estimated that the true number of people who had been infected with the coronavirus in the U.K. as of March 30 was somewhere between 800,000 and 3.7 million \u2014 as compared to a reported case count through that date of just 22,141.\n\nSo in this article, I\u2019m going to work through four examples of how various testing strategies can skew case counts, in the hopes of giving you a more hands-on sense for how the mechanics behind the numbers work. These scenarios are definitely not meant as predictions of what will happen in any given country, state or region. They work with hypothetical data, because we don\u2019t know all the parameters we\u2019d need to properly estimate a model anyway. The goal is just to illustrate, given relatively simple assumptions, how reported case counts for a disease can differ from the actual number of infections.\n\nAt the same time, the parameters in each scenario reflect what I hope are semi-realistic assumptions that at least loosely approximate the coronavirus situation in different groups of countries. Some countries have relatively robust testing. Some started out with strong testing but then stalled out. Some were way behind on testing but soon caught up. Each of these can have different effects on the pattern of reported cases.\n\nYou can even download an Excel spreadsheet and input your own assumptions \u2014 though I\u2019m going to wait until the end of the story to give you the link, in the hopes that you\u2019ll continue reading about how this all works before trying to brew up your own scenario.\n\nThe not-so-simple math behind coronavirus testing\n\nThe core purpose of this exercise is to help you think through how many people might test positive for a disease based on how many people are actually infected with it, given various assumptions about testing. That does require us to make some simple assumptions about the underlying number of infected people in the population. So the scenarios are partly based on what should be a fairly simple, standard epidemiological model.\n\nThe most important number in any epidemiological model is R, or the reproduction ratio, which is how many people that a person in one generation passes the disease along to in the next generation. For example, if a disease has an R of 3, that means each infected person transmits it to three more people. So one initial case becomes three newly infected people in the next generation, which becomes nine people, which becomes 27 people, which becomes 81 people, and so forth \u2014 the very nature of exponential growth is that it gets out of hand quickly!\n\nAssumptions about the R of COVID-19 vary, and to some extent that\u2019s inevitable given that there isn\u2019t necessarily one intrinsic number for how the disease spreads from one infected person to the next. In fact, epidemiologists make a distinction between R0 (pronounced R-zero or R-naught), which is called the basic reproduction ratio, or how fast the disease spreads in the absence of any interventions or any immunity whatsoever, and the effective reproduction ratio, called R-effective or simply R. R-effective is likely to be much higher on a cruise ship or in a college dormitory than in the middle of a remote town in Alaska where people rarely encounter one another, for example. Moreover, interventions such as social distancing are being undertaken to bring down R, although actions can vary from location to location. The goal, though, is to get R below 1, which means that a disease begins to die out in a population. (It will die out gradually if R is close to 1 and quickly if it\u2019s close to zero, say, 0.2.) Finally, if a disease has spread very widely throughout the population, R may eventually fall because of herd immunity. In other words, enough people are immune to a disease because they\u2019ve already had it, it will not continue to spread as fast.\n\nSo in these scenarios, I assume that R goes through three different stages that reflect various efforts at containment:\n\nFirst, there\u2019s an uncontrolled stage where the disease is spreading unchecked throughout the population. I assume this stage has an R of 2.6. The WHO initially estimated R to be between 2.0 and 2.5, but other researchers such as those from Imperial College London have since revised their numbers upward to around 3.0; thus, 2.6 reflects something of a middle ground.\n\nwhere the disease is spreading unchecked throughout the population. I assume this stage has an of 2.6. The WHO initially estimated to be between 2.0 and 2.5, but other researchers such as those from Imperial College London have since revised their numbers upward to around 3.0; thus, 2.6 reflects something of a middle ground. Next, there\u2019s an intermediate stage where some measures are being undertaken \u2014 businesses are having their employees work from home, large events are cancelled, and people are avoiding some unnecessary contacts and generally being more careful. But, there are no lockdown or quarantine measures in place. I assume that R falls to 1.4 during this stage.\n\nwhere some measures are being undertaken \u2014 businesses are having their employees work from home, large events are cancelled, and people are avoiding some unnecessary contacts and generally being more careful. But, there are no lockdown or quarantine measures in place. I assume that falls to 1.4 during this stage. Finally, there\u2019s a lockdown stage where R falls to 0.7 \u2014 or below one, meaning that the disease begins to die out.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of disagreement about these values \u2014 both how fast COVID-19 was spreading initially and how effective various interventions have been at lowering R. So you are welcome to download the spreadsheet at the end of this article and tweak those assumptions. (Note that the scenarios also account for R gradually reducing over time because of herd immunity, so the actual values of R in the scenarios may be slightly lower than the ones stated above.)\n\nNext: How long does a generation last? By a generation, I don\u2019t mean the Baby Boomers or something like that \u2014 I mean one round of infections. The number that determines the length of a generation is the serial interval, which is how long it takes, on average, for a person to transmit the disease to the people he infects. For COVID-19, estimates of the serial interval hover between four to five days. So I assume that a generation lasts five days in the scenarios.\n\nI also assume that the disease has varying levels of severity, and that this affects whether people are tested. In particular, I assume that:\n\n10 percent of cases are severe.\n\n60 percent of cases are mild.\n\nAnd 30 percent of cases are asymptomatic.\n\nAgain, this seems to match the consensus of the medical literature on COVID-19 \u2026 but there is a lot of disagreement about these parameters \u2014 and especially on the number of asymptomatic cases. So I\u2019d welcome you to input different values and see how they affect the results.\n\nHowever, in considering who gets tested, we also need to think about people who have symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 but who don\u2019t actually have the coronavirus. I haven\u2019t seen much research on this question, but thermometer data seems to find that around 3 percent of the U.S. population typically feels sick at this point in the year. So the scenarios assume that at any given time, 0.1 percent of the population has symptoms that resemble severe COVID-19 symptoms for reasons other than coronavirus (say, a bad flu or bronchitis or pneumonia), and that 2.5 percent have symptoms that resemble mild COVID-19 symptoms for other reasons than coronavirus (say, a mild flu or a bad cold). Furthermore, I assume that all people with severe symptoms seek testing (that is, they would get tested if they could), that half of people with mild symptoms do and that 2 percent of asymptomatic people do. All of these assumptions can also be changed in the spreadsheet.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! I don\u2019t really consider the scenarios a \u201cmodel\u201d in the way FiveThirtyEight usually uses that term because we\u2019re not trying to predict anything, we\u2019re just trying to show how different testing strategies can impact the number of reported cases. But, as in the case of real coronavirus models, there are an awful lot of messy, real-world problems we need to consider, too.\n\nOne of them is that there\u2019s a long lag between when someone is infected, when they develop symptoms, when they get tested and when those test results are reported. In Wuhan, China, the lag between the development of symptoms and test results being reported was around 10 to 12 days. And considering it usually takes at least a few days for symptoms to develop, the lag between infection and a case showing up in the test statistics is going to be longer still. In these scenarios, I therefore assume that there\u2019s a delay of 15 days (or three generations) between infection and the test results showing up in the data \u2014 though if anything I suspect this is too generous, given the huge testing bottlenecks in places such as California.\n\nAnother real-world problem is that the tests aren\u2019t perfect. In fact, according to reporting by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, around 30 percent of people who actually have COVID-19 test negative for it \u2014 which is what we\u2019d call a false negative. Other estimates of false negatives aren\u2019t quite so high, so I assume a 20 percent false negative rate in the scenarios.\n\nThen, of course, there\u2019s also the question of false positives, i.e., when a test reports that someone has COVID-19 but they actually don\u2019t. This number is harder to pin down, but we can infer that tests rarely produce false positives. Why? In Iceland, where large numbers of asymptomatic people are being tested, the overall rate of positive tests among this group is slightly under 1 percent. Given that includes people who probably do have the coronavirus (since asymptomatic cases are fairly common), we can assume the rate of false positives is even lower \u2014 for the purpose of the scenarios, we\u2019ll guess that it\u2019s 0.2 percent.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a bit of a mathematical twist in calculating false positives. Even if false positives are rare, false positives may swamp true positives if the underlying incidence of a disease is low. Say, for instance, that in the early stages of an outbreak in a town of 100,000 people, 100 people or 0.1 percent of the population actually has the disease. If everyone gets tested, then there will be roughly 200 false positives (0.2 percent of the population) \u2014 larger than the number of people who are actually sick! This is why some of the discourse around false positive tests is confusing. It can both be true that the rate of false positives is fairly low and that a high share of positive tests are false. For better or worse, this becomes less of an issue as new infections multiply; there are lots of real positives, so they no longer drown out the false positives.\n\nFinally, there are a further set of assumptions we have to make about how many tests are conducted and who gets tested. But those vary from scenario to scenario. So let\u2019s work through the scenarios now:\n\nScenario 1: Robust growth in testing\n\nTo emphasize that these are hypothetical scenarios and to get you in an appropriately abstract mindset, I\u2019m going to ask you to imagine that these scenarios occur in a country called Covidia, which has 10 million people and where the first infected person entered the country on Jan. 1 (although his case wasn\u2019t detected until later).\n\nIn this first scenario, Covidia \u2014 like most real-world countries \u2014 is a little slow to undertake social distancing measures. They take some intermediate steps on March 1, by which time 183,000 people there have already been infected, though far fewer positive tests (just 439!) have been reported. On March 16, with the number of cases still rapidly increasing, Covidia implements a full stay-at-home order (what I\u2019m informally calling a \u201clockdown\u201d), which reduces R to less than one.\n\nIn better news, the testing situation is comparatively good in this version of Covidia. In this scenario, I assume that Covidia starts out with the capacity to do 1,000 tests per generation, and beginning in early February, it improves testing volume by 50 percent per generation until all testing demand is satisfied. I further assume that Covidia rations 75 percent of tests, meaning that tests go to people with severe symptoms before people with mild symptoms, and to people with mild symptoms before people with no symptoms. The remaining 25 percent of tests are available on an on-demand basis.\n\nSo, what does this look like? Here is how the actual number of infections compares to the number of reported cases in Covidia, first in table form\u2026\n\nCovidia Scenario 1: Robust testing Testing capacity starts at 1,000 tests, but then increases by 50 percent per generation until all demand is met. Most tests are reserved for people with symptoms but some are available on-demand.

Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.\n\n\u2026and then in chart form:\n\nThere are quite a few things to look at here. The most obvious and probably the most important one is simply that a 15-day delay between when someone gets infected and when their case shows up in the data as a positive test makes a huge difference. Even if everything else was going perfectly \u2014 100 percent of the population was being tested and the tests are 100 percent accurate \u2014 with an R of 2.6, a 15-day delay would result in there being about 18 times more newly infected people in the population than the number of newly reported positive tests at any given time.\n\nThe delay matters less as R declines because if the disease isn\u2019t growing as fast, there aren\u2019t as many new people who get infected in the 15-day period between infection and test results. But it still means we\u2019re always looking two weeks into the past whenever \u201cnew\u201d data is reported. And remember, social distancing measures that are effective in flattening the curve may take two or three weeks to show up in the data. This is especially so when the demand for testing is near its peak and there are likely to be longer lags in processing test results.\n\nNext, even with relatively good testing, you\u2019re still likely to miss many cases. By the end of the scenario on June 29, 1.2 million people have been infected at some point in Covidia, but there are only 186,000 detected cases, for a detection rate of about 16 percent (and some of those are false positives so the actual situation is a bit worse than that). What accounts for the missing cases?\n\nFirst, we assume that many people with mild symptoms or no symptoms do not want to get tested (and nobody forces them to get tested) so they get infected at some point without ever realizing it.\n\nNext, the 20 percent false negative rate means that some cases are missed.\n\nFinally, even where testing ramps up quickly, it may not ramp up quite as fast as the disease itself. The actual peak in new infections in this scenario comes on March 16 \u2014 and at that point, testing is not fully scaled up and a lot of people who would like a test still cannot get one.\n\nThere\u2019s also a third issue: If testing is increasing, the rate of growth of a disease can be overestimated. Alternatively, if testing is stagnant or decreasing, the rate of growth can be underestimated. Note that in Scenario 1, the R you\u2019d infer from the number of reported cases peaks at 3.5, when the actual R based on infections was not quite as high (2.6 before Covidia began implementing social distancing measures).\n\nIn other words, the rapid rates of growth in new cases you can see in a country (say, Germany) when it first gets serious about testing are both a function of the number of tests increasing and the number of infections increasing \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s what. You can also have problems if there\u2019s a sudden, one-off increase in tests, as we\u2019ll see in the next scenario.\n\nA final issue \u2014 I\u2019m not going to boldface it because it\u2019s less important than the others \u2014 is that in the late stages of the scenario when there is little disease transmission following a prolonged lockdown, many of the newly detected \u201ccases\u201d are false positives. As I mentioned, false positives can be an issue to contend with when the overall incidence of disease in a population is low. They are not the greatest concern in the U.S. or Europe right now, when we\u2019re still in the peak of the pandemic.\n\nScenario 2: Sudden, one-time increase in testing\n\nWhat would a more rapid increase in testing look like? In Scenario 2, I\u2019m leaving all the settings from Scenario 1 unchanged \u2014 except for the number of tests. In this new scenario, I assume that Covidia starts out with the capacity to conduct only 100 tests per generation, but then goes on a crash program in February and rapidly increases that number at a rate of 200 percent per generation until it maxes out at 100,000 tests about a month later. This is similar to the situation in the United States, where testing started out slow, improved rapidly and has now stalled out again.\n\nIn this scenario, the distortions between the number of infections and the number of people who test positive are more profound. Even though the actual R is \u201conly\u201d 2.6 in the early stages \u2014 still a very scary, high number by the way \u2014 it will briefly appear to be as high as 7.8 if you\u2019re looking at the number of newly detected cases because test capacity is scaling up so rapidly.\n\nCovidia Scenario 2: Rapid, one-time testing increase Testing capacity starts at 100 tests, but then rapidly increases over a period of 4-5 weeks before maxing out at 100,000 tests.

Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.\n\nAnd on a graph, the slope will look extremely steep for a few weeks. You might be tempted to look at a graph like this and say that Covidia is on a much worse trajectory than other countries:\n\nBut that isn\u2019t getting the story right. What really happened was: Covidia was way behind on testing and it\u2019s playing catch-up, which means that the number of reported cases will increase at very fast rates until it does catch up. But the actual number of infections at any given time is the same as in Scenario 1. That doesn\u2019t mean the news in Scenario 2 is good, exactly. It means Covidia had a very big COVID-19 problem all along that wasn\u2019t being detected until very recently, but it is now finally starting to get its arms around it.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at the opposite case: Where testing starts out reasonably strong, but doesn\u2019t scale up very much.\n\nScenario 3: High test floor, low test ceiling\n\nIn this scenario, I assume that Covidia starts out with up to 10,000 tests available per generation. However, it scales up tests very slowly (by just 3 percent per generation) before eventually capping out at 20,000 tests per generation. Furthermore, 100 percent of tests are reserved for symptomatic individuals and there are no on-demand tests available. This situation is broadly analogous to some European countries with centralized, socialized health care systems. For instance, the U.K. has tested only about 160,000 people total as of Apr. 2, or an average of only about 7,000 tests per day since March 19.\n\nIn this case, the number of cases is substantially underestimated because there aren\u2019t enough tests at the peak of the epidemic. Only about 5 percent of infections are eventually detected.\n\nCovidia Scenario 3: Testing capacity doesn\u2019t scale up Testing capacity starts at 10,000 tests, but then increases by only 3 percent per generation before maxing out at 20,000 tests. All tests are rationed so people with more severe symptoms are given priority.

Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.\n\nBut not only is the number of cases underestimated \u2014 the rate of increase will also be underestimated. For instance, in this scenario, R appears to peak in the low-to-mid 2\u2019s when it\u2019s actually 2.6. This is because the rate of new cases is increasing faster than the country\u2019s ability to detect them, even if the country rations as many of the tests as it can so it can test the sickest individuals, as we assume that it does. During the peak of the epidemic in Scenario 3, as many as 58 percent of newly reported tests will produce positive results, which resembles the extremely high rate of reported positives for periods of time in places such as Lombardy, Italy.\n\nSo while the slope of reported new cases in Scenario 3 might look more gentle than in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2\u2026\n\n\u2026the country\u2019s situation is actually just as bad. And in some respects it might be worse. Having conducted so few tests, Covidia will miss some extremely ill people in Scenario 3 and they may die as a result of not being able to get medical care soon enough.\n\nThat\u2019s not the worst-case scenario, though. Imagine if a country, recognizing that the media tends to fixate on case counts, decides that it can make things look superficially better by decreasing the number of tests that it does.\n\nScenario 4: A testing decrease\n\nLet\u2019s say that, as in Scenario 3, Covidia starts out with the capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per generation. However, as the case count begins to accelerate, the government panics that the outbreak will make it look bad, so it subtly starts scaling down testing capacity by 20 percent per generation in early March. Meanwhile, being in denial about the scale of the problem, it doesn\u2019t implement a full lockdown until April 10, or more than three weeks later than under the other scenarios.\n\nI should note that this is more of a \u201cthought experiment\u201d than the other three scenarios. Countries from China to Russia to Iran have been accused of publishing unreliable official statistics \u2014 but I don\u2019t know whether any countries are deliberately limiting testing to keep case counts down.\n\nNonetheless, a situation like this obviously turns out quite badly. Almost 30 percent of the country eventually gets infected:\n\nCovidia Scenario 4: Testing declines to conceal outbreak Testing capacity starts at 10,000 tests, but gradually decreases in the midst of the outbreak. The government also waits several additional weeks to declare a full lockdown. All tests are rationed so people with more severe symptoms are given priority.

Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.\n\nWould the country really wait so long to implement a lockdown? Well, if it wasn\u2019t doing enough testing, it might. Because Covidia is reducing the number of tests in this scenario, the number of reported new cases will appear to peak on March 16, even though the actual peak of new infections won\u2019t come until April 5. It will appear that the partial measures it undertook worked, when really they weren\u2019t working well enough:\n\nIn an instance like this, having information on the number of tests would be quite useful, as a high rate of positive tests could be a sign that you\u2019re only seeing the tip of the iceberg. During the peak of the outbreak in April, as many as 64 percent of tests would return positive results in Scenario 4, the number would be as high as 80 percent if not for false negatives.\n\nI already gave away the conclusion at the top of the story, so I\u2019m just going to repeat it once more, hoping that this article has helped to convince you of it: The number of reported COVID-19 cases is not a very useful indicator of anything unless you also know something about how tests are being conducted.\n\nIn fact, in some cases, places with lower nominal case counts may actually be worse off. In general, a high number of tests is associated with a more robust medical infrastructure and a more adept government response to the coronavirus. The countries that are doing a lot of testing also tend to have low fatality rates \u2014 not just low case fatality rates (how many people die as a fraction of known cases) but also lower rates of death as a share of the overall population. Germany, for example, which is conducting about 50,000 tests per day \u2014 seven times more than the U.K. \u2014 has more than twice as many reported cases as the U.K., but they\u2019ve also had only about one-third as many deaths.\n\nPut another way: Doing more tests is good, and likely leads to better long-run outcomes, even if it also results in higher case counts that people will freak out about in the short run. I don\u2019t usually like to be so didactic, but I hope you\u2019ll be a more educated consumer of COVID-19 data instead of just looking at case counts ticking upward on cable news screens without context. That context includes not only reporting about the amount of testing, but also indications such as hospital strain, which are more robust since they aren\u2019t subject to as many vagaries about how tests are conducted. Even if you\u2019re not from New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily briefings are worth watching because they do the best job I\u2019ve seen of providing this context.\n\nAnd if you do want to play with your own scenarios to see how all of this works\u2026 here\u2019s the link to that Excel sheet. Have fun, but keep in mind that even though there are a lot of parameters you can tweak, the scenarios are still a fairly crude simplification of the complex situation on the ground in any given state or country.\n\nCORRECTION (April 13, 2020, 1:47 p.m.): In describing what it would take for the new coronavirus to begin to die out, a previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the R value falling below zero, which is not possible.

From those individual responses, the survey organizers \u2014 Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich of the University of Massachusetts Amherst \u2014 build a probabilistic consensus forecast, which is a tool that combines all of the responses to project the most likely future scenario as well as the range of possible outcomes.\n\nEach expert\u2019s answers contribute to the consensus forecast equally. This week, McAndrew and Reich explored the possibility of weighting experts based on their accuracy in past surveys, but they decided against it. \u201cThe performance of individual experts has varied from week to week, and we haven\u2019t found a benefit to using different weights for each expert to build more accurate consensus distributions,\u201d they said.\n\nHere\u2019s what the researchers said this past week.\n\nWhat is the smallest, most likely and largest number of total cases that The COVID Tracking Project will report on April 5?\n\nWhen the survey was sent out on March 30, The COVID Tracking Project was reporting about 141,000 COVID-19 cases in the U.S. The survey asked how many total cases will be reported on April 5, and even just a week out, there was a great deal of uncertainty in many of the experts\u2019 forecasts.\n\nMary Bushman, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University\u2019s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, said much of the uncertainty in case counts is related to the availability of testing. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know whether testing capacity will continue to increase and keep pace with increasing numbers of infections.\u201d\n\nThe expert consensus suggests that about 387,000 cases will be reported on April 5, with a 90 percent chance of between 256,000 and 643,000 cases being reported. Last week, the consensus forecast predicted around 117,000 cases as of Sunday, March 29, and there turned out to be about 139,000.\n\nHow many people will die in the U.S. due to COVID-19 this year?\n\nOn Tuesday, Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx \u2014 members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force \u2014 estimated that COVID-19 could kill 100,000 to 240,000 Americans even if all federal guidelines are followed closely. But the surveyed experts aren\u2019t assuming those guidelines will be followed, which helps explain their higher consensus forecast of 263,000 deaths and their high-end estimate of 1.7 million deaths.\n\n\u201cI think we can be reasonably confident that most of the U.S. will remain under some social or physical distancing directives for at least the next few weeks,\u201d Bushman said. \u201cBut there is significant uncertainty over how well people will comply with these directives and how much they actually reduce transmission, considering all of the activities that are exempted as essential.\u201d\n\nIn the three weeks we\u2019ve been tracking the survey, the number of forecasted deaths has increased from 200,000 to 263,000.\n\nHow many total COVID-19 infections were actually in the U.S. on March 30?\n\nAlthough the The COVID Tracking Project reported about 141,000 total U.S. cases on Monday, the experts think the number of infections \u2014 symptomatic or asymptomatic \u2014 in the U.S. was much higher.\n\nThey believe there were between 289,000 and 12.8 million infections, with 1.1 million being the consensus estimate, implying that the experts think that only about 12 percent of all infections have been reported. This is in line with what they\u2019ve reported for the past three weeks, when the share of reported infections has ranged between 9 percent and 12 percent.\n\nWhen will New York state report fewer than 1,000 new daily cases of COVID-19?\n\nOn April 1, 7,917 new cases were reported in New York state, and that daily number has been increasing steadily for weeks.\n\nThe experts were asked when they thought the number of daily reported cases would drop below 1,000, assuming that work from home restrictions remain in place. The majority think it will happen sometime in April, but some experts think it\u2019s possible that won\u2019t happen until July.\n\nThe consensus forecast is that the number of new cases in New York state will drop below 1,000 around April 28, but any date between April 9 and June 9 is a reasonable estimate.\n\nThis week, the survey also asked each expert to report the proportion of their responses that comes from experience and intuition rather than from hard models built by themselves or other researchers. On average, 68 percent of each expert\u2019s responses are coming from experience and intuition, with the other 32 percent coming from models.\n\nThat a group of expert infectious disease modelers is relying more on their experience and intuition than on hard models is yet more evidence that building a COVID-19 model is a huge, huge challenge.", "author": ["Jay Boice"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-easy-to-overhype-new-coronavirus-discoveries/", "published": "2020-04-02T16:21:51", "title": "It\u2019s Easy To Overhype New COVID-19 Discoveries", "text": "When it comes to the novel coronavirus, few data points are as reliable as they might appear. Whether it\u2019s the total number of people infected, the fatality rate, or even which drugs might show therapeutic promise \u2014 uncertainty confounds our understanding. Things are seldom as straightforward as we would like them to be.\n\nThe latest example of this dynamic came on Tuesday, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new data about how underlying health conditions can affect individuals\u2019 response to COVID-19. At first glance, the report suggested that people with those health conditions \u2014 such as diabetes, chronic lung disease and heart disease \u2014 were at a higher risk for severe disease or death from COVID-19. That finding is consistent with more anecdotal studies of COVID-19 patients in both China and Italy.\n\nBut as you go deeper into the data, the limitations of the finding become more clear. As of March 28, the CDC had collected data for 7,162 COVID-19 positive patients that included information on whether they had underlying health conditions or other known risk factors. That is just 5.8 percent of the 122,653 total U.S. COVID-19 cases reported to the CDC as of that time. But the size of the data set isn\u2019t the biggest concern. The biggest concern is that we don\u2019t know whether that subset is representative of the population of infected individuals. Without that, we don\u2019t know whether the findings are representative, either.\n\nIn that subset of 7,162 cases, 37.6 percent of people had one or more underlying conditions. The CDC looked at three outcomes \u2014 hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit and death \u2014 and calculated which percentage in each outcome had comorbidities. (There were also 525 people for whom hospitalization status was unknown.) They found that 71 percent of those hospitalized, and 78 percent of ICU patients, had one or more underlying conditions, compared to only 27 percent of those who weren\u2019t hospitalized. They also found that of the 184 deaths in the sample, 173 (94 percent) had at least one underlying condition.\n\nThose are highly suggestive numbers when taken out of context. And, sure enough, a few headlines did: \u201cMore than 70% of Americans hospitalized with COVID-19 had at least 1 underlying health condition,\u201d wrote Business Insider. \u201cNearly 80% of US intensive-care cases have underlying conditions,\u201d wrote Nature, one of the world\u2019s premier scientific journals.\n\nA more accurate headline might be: \u201cNearly 80 percent of a likely unrepresentative group of COVID-19 patients who went into intensive care had underlying conditions.\u201d\n\nNot quite the same effect, is it?\n\nThe CDC is transparent about the limitations of its data set, including the potential selection bias. Because the sample of patients the CDC looked at wasn\u2019t randomly selected, the 94.2 percent of COVID-19 patients with no underlying health data can\u2019t be assumed to be similar to those for whom that data exists. The fact that this group isn\u2019t representative of the whole set of COVID-19 patients means that we can\u2019t assume that any of the statistics based on the 5.8 percent sample holds true for all patients. In some cases, these 5.8 percent may be more likely to be severe cases, and might be both more likely to have underlying conditions in the first place and more likely to have outcomes such as hospitalization, intensive care or death. But the authors also note that reporting occurred too early to fully capture all of the outcomes \u2014 meaning that some patients, both with and without comorbidities, might still experience worsening outcomes, which would also change the conclusions. We won\u2019t know for sure unless we have better data.\n\nWe reached out to the CDC researchers to ask why data on underlying conditions and comorbidities were so hard to get, but they did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It appears that at least some of the missing data can be explained by a lack of time. The authors indicate that the \u201creporting burden associated with rapidly rising case counts and delays in completion of information requiring medical chart review\u201d are most to blame.\n\nThe limitations of this data don\u2019t change what we should all know by now: Those with underlying conditions should still be especially careful about contracting the disease. And just because this data set isn\u2019t perfect doesn\u2019t mean it has nothing to say: Especially since it seems in accordance with previous studies, it does suggest people with underlying conditions are at increased risk. It\u2019s just that we still don\u2019t know how much more danger they\u2019re in, despite headlines suggesting otherwise.", "author": ["Josh Hermsmeyer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-crowded-park-isnt-much-safer-than-a-crowded-movie-theater/", "published": "2020-04-01T17:50:27", "title": "When Is It Safe To Go Outside?", "text": "Some of you may remember the \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d from a stray econ class you took in school.

Hundreds of millions of Americans are being asked to stay inside to prevent the spread of COVID-19. But in many parts of the country, residents are still allowed to go outdoors for exercise and fresh air. Unfortunately, when everyone decides to get some fresh air in the same place at the same time, crowds start to form. This has led to tighter restrictions \u2014 many beaches and parks in California are now closed because of crowds \u2014 and plenty of social media shaming.\n\nBut it\u2019s the outdoors! There\u2019s fresh air! Isn\u2019t that a better place to be with a crowd than, say, a movie theater?\n\n\u201cThe higher number of people close together, the higher the likelihood that you\u2019ll get something, no matter if you\u2019re indoors or outdoors,\u201d said Dr. Kartik Patel, a primary care doctor with UCHealth in Colorado.\n\nOh.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as many public health officials recommend keeping a distance of at least 6 feet from other people when you leave your home, including visiting public outdoor spaces. (And one MIT professor has wondered whether 6 feet is far enough.) While that seems fairly straightforward on paper, in practice it can get confusing quickly. If you\u2019re jogging down the street and start approaching a neighbor walking in the opposite direction, for example, should you cross to the other side?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been crossing the street,\u201d said Carolyn Cannuscio, a social epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Public Health Initiatives. \u201cI know that offends people sometimes. Someone called me out the other day and said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to give you the virus!\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m an epidemiologist.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther experts I spoke to felt the risk of merely passing by someone on the street is minimal, but that the more contact you come into with people \u2014 no matter where it is \u2014 the higher the risk. We know one way the virus spreads is through respiratory droplets that are expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n\n\u201c[This] can also include laughing and singing,\u201d Patel said. \u201cAll of these actions are essentially expelling much of our lung volume when we do them. In the same context, heavy breathing while exercising would do the same as the aforementioned and, thus, could also cause the spread of a virus. There is no specific study that shows all of this; however, it is extrapolated from numerous studies on virology and respirology.\u201d\n\nWhile Cannuscio said being outdoors in its well-ventilated glory can help reduce the risk of transmission generally, that benefit starts to erode as more people congregate.\n\nEven if an outdoor space technically has enough area for each person using it to have a 6-foot buffer around them, people have a habit of encroaching on those boundaries.\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight\n\nLet\u2019s use the Great Lawn in New York City\u2019s Central Park as an example. The Great Lawn spans 55 acres, which is a little under 2.4 million square feet. If you drew a circle around yourself with a radius of 3 feet, that circle would have an area of about 28 square feet. With that math, as long as no one\u2019s circle overlapped, around 80,000 people could safely use Central Park\u2019s Great Lawn at the same time. But, obviously, people have a habit of not sitting still. Tens of thousands of people aren\u2019t going to stay 6 feet apart for the entirety of their stay in the park, and navigating around all those people while trying to maintain that buffer would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.\n\nBut exercise and fresh air are still recommended. The CDC endorses exercise as a way to manage the stress and anxiety caused by our current social disruption, and some studies have shown that regular exercise can bolster your immune system.\n\nNo matter where you are, the key is to avoid other people. This could mean being flexible in your plans (if one trail is busy, find another), going out in the early morning or late evening, or deciding to work out at home more often.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be some risk in everything we do,\u201d said David Nieman, a biology professor who researches immune function at Appalachian State University. \u201cOur goal is to minimize the risk so that we can experience the benefits.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION (April 1, 2020, 5:28 p.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people who could be on Central Park\u2019s Great Lawn while remaining at least 6 feet apart. People could maintain a safe distance if everyone stood in a circle with a radius of 3 feet, not 6 feet, assuming no one\u2019s circles overlapped.

In the prior week, 6.6 million Americans had filed for unemployment insurance; the week before that, it was nearly 6.9 million. But today\u2019s number still means that a previously unthinkable 22 million unemployment claims have been filed since March 15.\n\nThis decline might signal that the biggest single-week job-loss numbers are behind us, between the initial wave of layoffs and the backlog of people who were unable to file claims earlier because of overloaded state unemployment agencies. But as we noted several weeks ago, economists think there may be 25 million more Americans at risk for layoffs, based on the industries hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. So even if the peak for weekly unemployment claims is over, the chart above could end up having a long tail, depending on how long Americans have to stay inside to combat the coronavirus.\n\nSome states are at different points in that progression than others. If we look at advance claims \u2014 which are reported weekly by state but are not identical to initial claims \u2014 we find that Maine saw the biggest decline week-over-week, with 57 percent fewer claims last week than the previous week. Claims in Michigan, which had seen huge total unemployment numbers, declined by 43 percent last week, more than twice as much as the national average (-19.9 percent). A similar story can be told in some other large states, including Ohio (-30 percent), Illinois (-30 percent) and California (-29 percent).\n\nOverall, only nine states or territories saw an increase in people seeking unemployment benefits last week, including North Carolina (+0.3 percent), Florida (+7 percent) and New York (+15 percent).

Using a combination of social distancing, tight travel restrictions and contact tracing, the country has kept its death toll under 100 people and seems to be leveling off its new cases. It\u2019s even managed to avoid closing schools. But despite the relatively minor impact the novel coronavirus has had on life in Australia, medical workers are still running low on masks, gloves and gowns.\n\n\u201cSuddenly it feels like a house of cards,\u201d said Simon Quilty, senior staff specialist at Alice Springs Hospital in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite [run out of personal protective equipment], but we\u2019ve come very close to it. We don\u2019t even have the pandemic. If we do get a pandemic, we\u2019re fucked.\u201d\n\nAll around the world, whether hard-hit by the virus or not, countries are running low on crucial supplies. And while shortages are largely confined to disposable medical items for now \u2014 personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs, chemicals used for COVID-19 testing \u2014 experts say other shortages are likely. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is affecting the way we manufacture all sorts of products, and the way we get those products to where they\u2019re needed. People who study these supply chains have seen problems coming for years. Now they\u2019re scrambling to get ahead of the pandemic, before it ends up affecting even our ability to produce the vaccines we hope will stop the disease in its tracks.\n\n\u201cUp until a few weeks ago, I knew very little about the supply chain,\u201d said Megan Ranney, a professor of emergency medicine at Brown University. \u201cIt always just worked. But I\u2019ve learned a bunch, and it\u2019s more fragile than we ever thought possible.\u201d COVID-19 has forced her \u2014 and lots of other hospitalists around the country \u2014 to become supply chain experts on the fly.\n\nA supply chain is a fancy term to describe how products get made and moved all around the globe. It\u2019s a simple concept, but not a simple process. Supply chains aren\u2019t a conveyor belt \u2014 they\u2019re a ballet. And there are many, many ways this spectacular show can fall flat on its face. The production of a single item often involves multiple factories in several different countries and depends on speedy, reliable international shipping to get each piece to the right place at the right time \u2014 and then to the buyers exactly when they need it.\n\nIn fact, experts in both manufacturing and medicine have spent years warning of the risks a pandemic \u2014 or another major disaster \u2014 could cause to supply chains. In 2011, for instance, Quilty documented that the hospital where he worked at the time had less than a 30 days\u2019 supply of penicillin and many other crucial pharmaceutical drugs. A 2017 paper by scientists with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that PPE supplies had run into problems during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic, and warned that the system wasn\u2019t prepared to handle a sudden increase in demand. Multiple reports have been published on how avian flu pandemics could disrupt everything from computer manufacturing to the global food supply.\n\n\u201cPPE is the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Ranney said. She, and other experts, told me that right now, that\u2019s the main place we\u2019re seeing supply chains break down. But those same issues apply to damn near everything else we make and sell. The longer the pandemic goes on, the more products will be affected.\n\nThere are three big problems with the global supply chains, experts told me. First, the push toward lowest-cost production means a lot of cheap goods and cheap components of more valuable goods are made in places with low-cost labor. When those countries experience a pandemic outbreak \u2014 or when a pandemic interrupts transport from those countries \u2014 it creates a bottleneck.\n\nAround half the world\u2019s face masks came from China before the novel coronavirus pandemic began. The virus interrupted manufacturing there early on, Ranney said. Now, China can make masks again, but demand has jumped all over the world, and there are shipping delays. Several companies have told her to expect deliveries to take three or four weeks. In the meantime, she\u2019s been left to sort through sketchy, back-alley PPE dealers, some of whom produce low-quality masks that either fall apart or don\u2019t filter properly on testing. Other would-be suppliers have turned out to be basically the high-stakes equivalent of one of those \u201cyou\u2019ve inherited $3,000,000!\u201d email scams.\n\nAmerican manufacturing companies are starting to switch over production lines to make masks and other protective equipment here \u2014 but that\u2019s not a quick process and presents its own complications. For example, the nonwoven textiles that N95 respirator masks use to filter out viruses have to be made on special machines. There are only a few of those machines in the whole world, said Julie Swann, professor of industrial and systems engineering at North Carolina State University. And you can\u2019t just go buy a new one off the shelf. Her university is producing some of this material now. \u201cBut not at the volume you\u2019d make at a large manufacturer,\u201d she said.\n\nThe second problem is that a global pandemic causes sudden spikes in demand for certain products. Production is designed for steady demand with predictable increases and decreases. A big, unforeseen event, like a pandemic, throws everything out of whack, said Adegoke Oke, professor of supply chain management at Arizona State University\u2019s school of business. Take our toilet paper woes. That supply chain didn\u2019t account for sudden, nationwide increases in having to pee at home. It also didn\u2019t anticipate every office in the nation suddenly holding it, indefinitely. You might think that the demand in one sector could be met by the excess from the other, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. \u201cThe type of toilet paper you use in the office \u2014 the big rolls \u2014 are totally different from what you use at home,\u201d Oke said. \u201cThey require different supply chains and different manufacturing lines.\u201d\n\nAnd when manufacturing capacity can\u2019t keep up with a sudden surge in demand, there are no emergency backup supply closets to raid. That\u2019s because of a popular and widespread business practice called \u201cjust in time\u201d supply. Essentially, it means that businesses from hospitals to grocery stores keep only a small amount of supplies on hand at any given time \u2014 enough to get through a couple of weeks or a month. Just-in-time saves money on warehouse storage, energy and staffing, but it works only if the supplies can be produced and delivered when you need them. \u201cIt\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Oke said. \u201cBut at a time like this, the last thing you want is just-in-time.\u201d\n\nFinally, supply chains are also getting disrupted in some truly surprising ways \u2014 ripple effects that spread from one industry to another. Take the transportation of goods. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty dependent on European tourism \u2014 80 percent of the air cargo capacity across the Atlantic comes aboard passenger flights. When those all but stopped, it created a transportation bottleneck for manufacturing, said James Robinson, an independent consultant who spent 30 years working in vaccine manufacturing for companies like Merck. Airlines are turning their empty passenger jets into cargo flights, but that takes retrofitting and time and money \u2014 and it\u2019s going to increase the cost of shipping, Robinson said.\n\nThen there\u2019s all the food being trashed in response to a pandemic that\u2019s cleared grocery shelves nationwide. The same parallel but separate home and business supply chains that affect the toilet paper supply also affect food. What people eat in a restaurant or at school \u2014 and how much of it they eat \u2014 isn\u2019t the same as what they eat at home. And the farmers who have typically supplied commercial kitchens don\u2019t have the sales, marketing, packaging and transport networks in place to get their food where it\u2019s needed. Fresh vegetables and milk have simply been thrown out. And that\u2019s not to mention facilities\u2019 closing when food industry workers are taken out by illness or migrant farm workers\u2019 not being able to cross borders at future harvest times \u2014 things that researchers have long predicted could cause food shortages in the U.S. during a time of pandemic. \u201cThe food supply could be vulnerable,\u201d Swann said. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want to scare people.\u201d\n\nThese supply chain issues can also create a weird sort of feedback loop: The virus increases demand for certain products, which jumbles supply chains for those products, which in turn hampers efforts to use those products to keep the virus in check. And that gives the virus time to beat up the economy even more.\n\nWhich is all to say that problems with the PPE supply could be only the beginning. As people like Robinson try to coordinate what will become an international effort to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine in the months ahead, for example, they\u2019re looking at what\u2019s going on with products like PPE \u2014 knowing that the same things could happen to vaccines.\n\n\u201cA vaccine manufacturer like Sanofi might source several thousand ingredients to make a vaccine,\u201d Robinson told me. \u201cBut each material is coming from factories with hundreds of sources, and those sources have sources.\u201d Like the connection between holiday travel and international shipping, supply chains for vaccines can end in unexpected places \u2014 like a Chilean tree farm.\n\nRobinson is vice chair of the scientific advisory committee for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an international organization that helps coordinate funding and research for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. CEPI is involved in the development of 10 different coronavirus vaccines, and Robinson expects at least three of those will eventually make it to widespread use. One of these vaccines, though, uses an adjuvant \u2014 a substance to help strengthen the body\u2019s immune response to a vaccine \u2014 that contains an oil extracted from the Quillaja saponaria Molina tree, common to Peru, Chile and Bolivia. The bark is harvested only between November and January each year, so this year\u2019s harvest didn\u2019t take the new coronavirus into account. There\u2019s only so much of that adjuvant available until next year, Robinson said.\n\nOther expected supply chain issues with vaccines are shaped by years of international trade patterns. For example, doses of vaccines are delivered in glass vials, and there\u2019s been a global shortage of glass stretching back to at least 2015. The medical glass industry was just beginning to catch up with increased demand, Robinson said, and now, novel coronavirus vaccines will create additional pressure. Even if the vaccine is loaded into 10-dose vials, that\u2019s still hundreds of millions of vials that will be needed, he told me. Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a novel coronavirus vaccine that Robinson regards as one of the most promising. \u201c[Janssen has] already preordered 250 million vials, and that might be all that\u2019s out there,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to procure another 200 million.\u201d\n\nWhat it boils down to is that even the vaccine industry isn\u2019t prepared for a sudden increase in demand on this scale \u2014 which would likely far outpace even the spikes associated with a bad flu season. \u201cIn 2009, H1N1 rapidly increased manufacturing and got up to 400 million doses in a year. But for a pandemic, we might need billions,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nThe biggest thing experts are taking away from all this is the weakness of that just-in-time supply chain. \u201cIn lean terminology, inventory is waste because it\u2019s supply you aren\u2019t using,\u201d Robinson said. But now, when demand is sharply rising, that inventory would be helpful \u2014 and so many industries are tied together that when one runs out of supply it affects the ability of other industries to keep functioning.\n\nProduction can be ramped up, and it is. But it takes time and investment \u2014 and it\u2019s important to remember that those investments are a risk. We might need American-made masks now, but will we keep buying them after the threat of COVID-19 has passed? Or will we revert to just-in-time supply from cheaper factories overseas? History suggests the latter. During previous epidemics of influenza, Texas-based company Prestige Ameritech saw demand soar, Swann told me. But it proved to be a boom and bust. The company invested in new machines to meet demand during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Swann said. \u201cAnd then they almost went out of business later because [the Texas company\u2019s product] was a little more expensive than the ones from China,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be willing to pay a little more during times of peace without crisis so we have supply available during crisis.\u201d", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/she-was-about-to-start-a-new-job-then-the-economy-collapsed/", "published": "2020-04-13T13:00:33", "title": "She Was About To Start A New Job.

To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nJust over a month ago, things were looking pretty rosy for Laura Buda. After an eight-year run at a midsize arts company, the 32-year-old marketing and communications specialist from Virginia was offered \u2014 and had accepted \u2014 a new job with a much larger organization.\n\nThe new gig would provide not only greater upward mobility for the future but also a higher salary for the present. To celebrate the change, Buda and her husband went on a brief getaway to the Blue Ridge Mountains during the 10-day gap between the final day of her previous job and the first day of her new one.\n\nBut during that hiatus in mid-March, the new coronavirus began spreading aggressively throughout America. Like everyone else, Buda saw schools and businesses shutting their doors in response. And like many other Americans, she began wondering how COVID-19 might affect her new job. Perhaps they\u2019ll push back my start date by a week, she thought, or if things get really bad, maybe a month.\n\nThen, late in the afternoon on Friday, March 20 \u2014 three days before she was slated to begin her new position \u2014 she got a phone call. A member of the company\u2019s human resources department apologized profusely but said that the organization was being forced to rescind Buda\u2019s offer because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus.\n\nBuda is part of a gray area within the nation\u2019s reeling economy: those who left one job voluntarily for another \u2014 before COVID-19 spread and altered nearly everything in its path \u2014 but who never technically started working at the second gig. People like her are left in the lurch, not knowing whether they\u2019ll ultimately be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.\n\nBuda\u2019s husband, who works as an attorney for the federal government, read through the unemployment stipulations carefully and told her he wasn\u2019t sure that her unique circumstances would qualify. \u201cThey ask you to list your last job, and I had to say that I left voluntarily,\u201d said Buda, still waiting to hear back about her filing. \u201cThere\u2019s a small area there to explain your circumstances a little more. But with how many people are filing for unemployment, I\u2019m not even totally sure that part will be read through closely.\u201d\n\nIf she ends up qualifying for unemployment, she estimates that it would amount to about $1,600 per month \u2014 a little bit less than what she and her husband had been paying in child care costs for their 16-month-old son, Dominic.\n\nThere have been some silver linings for Buda and her family, however. Her son\u2019s child care facility \u2014 which has continued to operate during the pandemic \u2014 has allowed parents to pull their children out of day care without having to pay during the crisis. (Some don\u2019t allow that.) And the recent coronavirus relief legislation lets some people with federal student loans temporarily halt their payments, which will save Buda about $450 a month. Perhaps most important: Buda\u2019s husband earns enough to support the family single-handedly. But they will still need to tighten their belts to get through this period.\n\nThe past four weeks have been a whirlwind for Buda. Not long ago, she had planned to buy clothes for the new job \u2014 something her bump in pay would have comfortably allowed. But now she counts it as a blessing that she never took that step. Instead of learning the ropes at her new gig, she spends her spare time \u2014 the time her toddler allows her to have \u2014 sifting through emails notifying her of openings she might be a match for.\n\n\u201cAnytime I\u2019m on the computer, [Dominic] wants to push all the buttons,\u201d she said.\n\nBuda vacillates between looking for jobs and thinking it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand, given the state of the economy. She would love to find something in theater, a field she\u2019d worked in for a long time. But she\u2019s also looking for jobs at nonprofits; she thinks positions with organizations that are untethered to the marketplace seem far more stable now and over the long haul.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people who work in industries that, when things reopen, things aren\u2019t going to go back to normal,\u201d Buda said. \u201cIn theater, people aren\u2019t going to want to engage right away, even if it\u2019s deemed safe. I just think the recovery is going to be so much harder for something like that.\u201d\n\nCheck out all the latest coronavirus polling we\u2019ve collected.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-than-16-million-americans-have-lost-their-jobs-in-the-past-three-weeks/", "published": "2020-04-09T14:17:54", "title": "More Than 16 Million Americans Have Lost Their Jobs In The Past Three Weeks", "text": "The coronavirus\u2019s record-breaking run of bad economic news continues unabated. Thursday\u2019s numbers from the Department of Labor reported that 6.6 million Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance, roughly the same as last week (which was revised to 6.9 million) and about double the previous week\u2019s tally of 3.3 million.\n\nAdd it up, and over the course of three weeks, a total of 16.8 million seasonally adjusted unemployment claims have been filed. If we borrow the math from this Justin Wolfers piece in The New York Times last week, that means somewhere around 15 to 17 percent of the workforce might currently be without a job. (For comparison\u2019s sake, that number was 25 percent at the height of the Great Depression.)\n\nThe U.S. has had eight recessions since 1967, including the one we are almost certainly in right now. Of those, four (1969-70, 1980, 1990-91 and 2001) never reached our current level, over 16 million unemployment claims. For the others, it took a tremendous amount of time to reach that level: between 33 weeks (1981-82) and 51 (1973-75). Even in the Great Recession a decade ago, it took 42 weeks to get 16 million total initial claims. This time around, it has taken three.\n\nThis recession is moving at hyperspeed For U.S. recessions since 1967, number of weeks before reaching each benchmark for total initial unemployment insurance claims Weeks before no. of total initial claims Recession of \u2026 3,000,000 9,000,000 16,000,000 1969-70 13 33 Never 1973-75 11 31 51 1980 8 19 Never 1981-82 7 20 33 1990-91 8 22 Never 2001 8 23 Never 2007-09 9 26 42 2020* 1 2 3 *The current economic downturn hasn\u2019t yet met the traditional definition of a recession. Previous recessions were considered to have started midway through the month they officially began and ended midway through the month they finished. Sources: Department of Labor, St. Louis Federal Reserve, National Bureau of Economic Research\n\nNow, it\u2019s important to remember that the U.S. population has also increased by 66 percent since 1967, meaning there are more workers to potentially file claims now. Furthermore, total initial claims are not equivalent to the number of people who are actually receiving unemployment benefits. And, of course, economists look at much more than just unemployment when determining whether a recession has happened.\n\nThat said, the sheer job-loss numbers for this recession \u2014 and the velocity at which they were amassed \u2014 are difficult to comprehend.\n\nGoing back to previous recessions, some analysts see parallels to the 1981-82 downturn. That recession is considered to have been triggered by changes in monetary policy, when former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation. By comparison, this recession was triggered by widespread stay-at-home orders that effectively shuttered countless businesses and put millions out of work. (We should note that economists almost unanimously agree that this was the best decision not only for public health reasons but also for the long-term economy.) Many jobs were lost in the early 1980s, but the unemployment rate quickly dropped after the initial shock, which may provide a model for people to return to work swiftly after the coronavirus crisis lifts.\n\nAgain, though, that early 1980s recession took much longer to reach present levels of jobless claims, so in many ways our current recession represents an unprecedented situation. That\u2019s particularly true when you consider the underlying reason why people can\u2019t go back to work \u2014 a novel virus for which a vaccine is still quite far off \u2014 and the uncertainty around what its eventual timeline will end up being. One thing is for sure, however: Most of us have never seen a recession produce such extreme economic hardship, so quickly, as what the U.S. is going through right now.", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/media-coverage-doesnt-actually-determine-public-opinion-on-the-economy/", "published": "2020-04-08T11:00:15", "title": "Media Coverage Doesn\u2019t Actually Determine Public Opinion On The Economy", "text": "In mid-February, Wall Street was celebrating the stock market reaching record highs. But the stock market has since lost roughly 20 percent of its value in the wake of the coronavirus, and the broader economy is in freefall as well. A record number of Americans have filed for unemployment benefits, and the March jobs report found the economy had lost 700,000 jobs \u2014 the first time that number has declined in a decade.\n\nBut even though large swaths of the economy have shuttered with extraordinary speed, this economic downturn is likely to hit some people and places much harder than others. Those disparate effects, in turn, raise a question that is critical for politics as well as economics: In a country as large and diverse as the U.S., how do citizens know whether the economy is doing better or worse?\n\nOne obvious source of information is the news media. In fact, some political scientists have found that negative news coverage of the economy can shape public opinion, especially in an election year. Marc Hetherington, for instance, found that media coverage in the run-up to the 1992 presidential election was more negative than the economy warranted and cost incumbent President George H.W. Bush support. That could be particularly telling now, considering this is all happening just months ahead of a presidential election, and a strong economy has historically boosted the incumbent president\u2019s chances of winning reelection.\n\nBut in a 2017 \u201cResearch & Politics\u201d article, Eunji Kim, Soojong Kim and I found that the news media\u2019s ability to influence Americans\u2019 perceptions of the economy may be overstated. Our analysis found that major media outlets\u2019 coverage of the economy is much more likely to lag public perceptions than to lead them. That means that the media coverage of an economic recession, like the one we seem to be headed toward, isn\u2019t independently reshaping how Americans think the economy is doing. Instead, we found that media coverage often follows public opinion.\n\nWe used nearly 40 years of data from the University of Michigan\u2019s surveys of consumers, a long-running survey that asks Americans their views of the economy, to create a monthly index of Americans\u2019 level of concern about the economy. We then compared that index to a measure of how 24 different media outlets covered the economy during that same time period, including big national newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post as well as regional papers like the Houston Chronicle. Systematically measuring media outlets\u2019 coverage in nearly half a million newspaper articles and television transcripts proved a bit more challenging. But similar to our approach with the economic survey data, we created an index, this time using words associated with positive or negative economies \u2014 words like \u201cbear,\u201d \u201cdrop,\u201d \u201cjobless,\u201d and \u201clayoff,\u201d as well as \u201cbull,\u201d \u201cgrowth,\u201d and \u201cinvest\u201d \u2014 to score the tone of economic stories published by these outlets.\n\nAnd if we drill down into one of the most prominent media outlets we analyzed, The New York Times, we find no indication that media coverage is shaping public opinion. A telltale sign of media influence would have been if the tone of the Times\u2019s economic coverage shifted before public perception does. But as you can see in the chart below, that didn\u2019t really happen. Instead, the public\u2019s perceptions of the economy more often seemed to lead news coverage rather than lag behind it. For instance, during key moments such as in the run-up to the Great Recession in 2008, the public grew more pessimistic well before the Times\u2019s tone shifted.\n\nIn fact, this was the case across the 24 media outlets we analyzed. There were some outlets for which we found that the tone of media coverage consistently led public perceptions of the economy, but overall, we found no strong evidence that media coverage pushed Americans as a whole to perceive the economy in one way or the other.\n\nGiven how much attention politicians devote to the tone of media coverage, these results may seem surprising. But we\u2019re actually not the only researchers to conclude that public perceptions aren\u2019t heavily influenced by how the media frames the economy. H. Brandon Haller and Helmut Norpoth, for instance, found that citizens\u2019 perceptions of the economy didn\u2019t vary much based on their news consumption habits.\n\nStill, other studies find evidence that the influence can run in both directions, with the tone of media coverage sometimes anticipating public perceptions. For example, Stuart Soroka, Dominik Stecula and Christopher Wlezien found that public perceptions can anticipate media coverage, but also that media coverage can actually lead public perceptions of how the economy has performed but not perceptions of how it will perform. After examining the tone of economic coverage in the four highest-circulation national newspapers, though, Amber Boydstun, Benjamin Highton, and Suzanna Linn conclude that media coverage can predict how Americans view the economy even after accounting for the state of the economy itself.\n\nOn two key points, then, academic research has been consistent: Public perceptions of the economy can get out ahead of media coverage, and public perceptions are also closely connected to actual economic conditions. This suggests that there are critical limits to the media\u2019s influence on public perceptions, which is consistent with other research that shows the impact of elite opinion is often overstated.\n\nIn other words, when the economy shifts directions, the news media\u2019s capacity to reshape public perceptions of the economy is limited at best. It\u2019s easy to pick up a newspaper and assume that its writers and editors can shape public opinion, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be true of the economy. Rather, the public reacts to real-world economic conditions, not media spin.\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Dan Hopkins"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-social-safety-net-wasnt-ready-for-the-coronavirus-crisis/", "published": "2020-04-08T10:00:03", "title": "America\u2019s Social Safety Net Wasn\u2019t Ready For The Coronavirus Crisis", "text": "The coronavirus crisis is testing almost every facet of American life, including the country\u2019s social safety net. For generations politicians have proposed (and haggled over) ways to help people during a garden-variety recession. And in the past few weeks, Congress has tried to strengthen the safeguards that already exist, passing a series of bills to get government assistance and other protections to more people, including a $2 trillion relief package with several provisions that directly affect workers and small businesses.\n\nBut most of these benefits haven\u2019t reached Americans yet, even as more and more have been forced to rely on the preexisting safety net. Since the coronavirus crisis began to intensify, FiveThirtyEight has been reporting on which workers are most economically vulnerable, and what the government can do to help. We\u2019d like to continue that by featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net. To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience by filling out this form.\n\nToday, we\u2019re bringing you three stories that illustrate a fact of American life that has become abundantly clear over the past few weeks: Our unemployment support systems are woefully underprepared for this crisis. That has caused delays in how quickly help can get to the people who need it most, and threatens to deplete states\u2019 financial reserves. Congress just injected $260 billion into the state unemployment insurance system, and most Americans will eventually receive $1,200 relief payments. Because of the way our unemployment insurance system is set up, many Americans are still struggling to file unemployment claims, and the amount of government assistance they\u2019ll receive will also depend on where they live. In the meantime, jobless workers are scrambling to pay their bills and discovering other cracks in the makeshift social safety net that\u2019s been created to catch them.\n\nWe talked to three young women whose stories show how the response has varied so far.\n\n\u201cI always thought my job was recession-proof.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of an economic downturn never really worried Lee Meach, 29, of Tampa, because there\u2019s always demand for her work as a pediatric occupational therapist, even in a sour economy. She thought it was her husband, Josh Frank, an urban designer who co-owns a landscape architecture and urban design firm, who had the unstable job. But soon after Florida public schools began to close and their county rolled out social-distancing ordinances, Meach\u2019s boss announced that the clinic where she works would be closing its doors for the foreseeable future. She and all her co-workers were laid off indefinitely.\n\nMeach was stunned \u2014 and unprepared. \u201cI always thought my job was recession-proof,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I went from being extraordinarily busy to unemployed in less than a week.\u201d She and Frank had bought a house three months earlier, so she was immediately concerned about how they would pay the mortgage \u2014 much less their student debt. That concern morphed into panic when she began to investigate Florida\u2019s unemployment insurance system and found that the state would pay only up to $275 per week in benefits, just a fraction of what she had been making at her job.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is putting a lot of pressure on the unemployment system and exposing the dramatic variations in states\u2019 relative generosity or stinginess with benefits. The federal government is attempting to standardize how much money people like Meach will receive by tacking an additional $600 per week onto every unemployed person\u2019s benefits for the next four months. But because of steps that some states like Florida have taken to restrict their unemployment insurance program, government aid to jobless workers will still be distributed unevenly.\n\nIn the wake of the Great Recession, Florida was among the states that created a complex patchwork of requirements for jobless workers. The state also capped benefits at 12 weeks \u2014 far below the national standard of 26 weeks. As a result, the share of unemployed workers receiving benefits in Florida and several other states with similar restrictions fell precipitously. In 2019, only 11.3 percent of the out-of-work population in Florida was receiving benefits, down from 30 percent in 2007. That recipiency rate \u2014 the share of unemployed people who actually receive benefits \u2014 is far below the 50 percent experts told us is typical during normal times, although that share usually rises during recessions.\n\nMany of the most burdensome restrictions have now been lifted in response to the coronavirus crisis, which means it should be easier for workers to receive benefits. And in fairness to Florida, states that were distributing benefits to a bigger share of unemployed workers were also unprepared for the recent influx of claims. But even with the additional $600 per week, jobless Floridians will still be getting far smaller payouts than workers in other states, where the maximum payments can be two or three times higher. And that\u2019s assuming the money makes it into their wallets anytime soon. Hours after Meach was laid off, she went online to submit her application to get unemployment benefits, only to be confronted by an antiquated and labyrinthine system online. \u201cYou can\u2019t refresh or you\u2019ll lose all your progress,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me about three hours to figure out where to upload my resume.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, she and Frank have scrambled to find other sources of income. He picked up some shifts taking calls and doing administrative work at his father\u2019s small business, while Meach grabbed a few extra hours as a remote lecturer. They also took advantage of their bank\u2019s offer to defer their mortgage payments. Meach finally got her unemployment application submitted by logging onto the website in the early morning, more than a week after she lost her job. By some measures, she was lucky \u2014 Florida\u2019s online system has been functioning so poorly that the state director of unemployment announced last week that his office will start issuing paper applications for jobless workers to mail in.\n\nBut Meach doesn\u2019t feel especially victorious, because she still has no idea when she\u2019ll actually get the money. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot to try to make things work financially,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the unemployment benefits are a big piece of the puzzle for us, so it\u2019s very stressful to wonder when and if that\u2019s going to come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat $1,200 would have given me another month of breathing room.\u201d\n\nThe bad news started for Chloe Carter-Daves, 21, when she lost her part-time job at a restaurant in New York City in mid-March. It continued when \u2014 after weeks of daily attempts \u2014 she still wasn\u2019t able to submit a claim for unemployment insurance. And it culminated in the discovery that because she\u2019s a student, she won\u2019t be receiving a $1,200 relief check from the federal government like most Americans, even though she\u2019s been supporting herself without help from her parents over the past few years.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans will receive a payment from the federal government over the coming weeks. But college students (and some high school students) fall into a kind of no man\u2019s land: They often don\u2019t file their own tax returns, even if they\u2019re basically self-sufficient, which means they won\u2019t qualify for the relief checks. And their families won\u2019t receive a child payment for them either since they\u2019re over the age of 16.\n\nFor some students who are living at home, that might not be such a burden. But Carter-Daves, a senior at Hunter College, stayed in her off-campus apartment, which means she\u2019s still paying for her own rent and groceries. \u201cI\u2019ll be real \u2014 even when I was working, I was living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d she said. \u201cThat $1,200 would have given me another month of breathing room.\u201d\n\nCutting most college students out of the relief payments could turn out to be a particularly big oversight because young workers are at an especially high risk of losing their jobs right now. As Ryan Best and I wrote on March 18, workers under age 25 are disproportionately more likely to lack both paid sick leave and the ability to work from home. Younger workers are also especially likely to work in the service and retail sales industries \u2014 which have both been among the hardest-hit sectors of the economy.\n\nIf Carter-Daves can get her unemployment insurance claim through, she says she should be OK financially, at least for a while. Her home state of New York has fairly generous benefits for jobless workers. But it was unprepared for the recent tsunami of unemployment claims in a different way. A Department of Labor report from February named New York among six states whose unemployment systems don\u2019t have enough money in their reserves to handle a normal recession. And, so far, the federal government hasn\u2019t taken steps to bail out cash-strapped state and local governments, which means that big states like New York and California are at risk of quickly burning through their unemployment insurance funds.\n\nBut more than two weeks after Carter-Daves lost her job, the website seemed to have become even less functional. \u201cFor a while, the issue was that I would start my application, get halfway through, and then the website would crash,\u201d she said. \u201cNow when I log in, there\u2019s no more option to file a claim.\u201d She\u2019s far from the only New Yorker for whom wrestling with the unemployment insurance website has become a full-time job \u2014 last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo apologized for the site\u2019s frequent crashes and said the state was working on fixing the problems.\n\nIn the meantime, Carter-Daves applied for an emergency assistance grant from her school and got enough money to cover her April rent. But she\u2019s already worried about future bills \u2014 particularly since, as a college senior, she\u2019s facing the dismal prospect of graduating into a frozen economy. \u201cI was planning on leaving the service industry once I graduated,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I think I\u2019m going to be grateful if I have any income at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe help is great, but I don\u2019t know if it will get to me in time.\u201d\n\nBefore the coronavirus crisis hit, Rebekah Guerra, 26, was already living on a shoestring budget in Los Angeles County. Faced with a mountain of student and medical debt, she moved back in with her parents last year while she tried to jump-start her business as a freelance marketing professional. But over the course of a few weeks in March, any semblance of financial stability evaporated. \u201cI work with a lot of smaller businesses, and they\u2019ve either closed their doors entirely or marketing is not their focus,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t really blame them \u2014 what is there to market if they have no business? But it means my work has completely gone away too.\u201d\n\nUp until recently, freelancers and independent contractors like Guerra were left out of the social safety net for jobless workers, since they don\u2019t usually qualify for unemployment insurance. That changed with the new bill passed by Congress, which created a new emergency unemployment program to cover them. But it could be complicated for states that are already swamped with claims to set up a new infrastructure to funnel funds to freelancers, whose incomes will be harder to verify. There are also questions about which freelancers will qualify, since according to new guidance from the federal government, people who can telework with pay are ineligible \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear what that will mean for people like Guerra, who are theoretically able to work from home but have lost all their business. Experts estimate that it could be weeks before the payments are actually distributed.\n\nAnd for Guerra, any delay could bring her closer to financial catastrophe. She has a chronic health condition that requires her to spend hundreds of dollars a month on medication. And she struggled to pay for her health insurance premium at the beginning of the month. \u201cI\u2019m reassessing my budget \u2014 giving up subscriptions, thinking about things like whether I can go to a lower level of coverage on my car insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nAll of this means that, to Guerra, the prospect of receiving government benefits \u2014 through unemployment insurance or a stimulus check \u2014 feels tantalizing but remote. \u201cThe help is great, but I don\u2019t know if it will get to me in time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I had a financial buffer before this. I understand the system is overloaded and I want to be patient, but my bills are coming due now.\u201d\n\nWhy it\u2019s so hard to make a good COVID-19 model", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-economy-still-the-most-important-thing-for-trumps-reelection/", "published": "2020-04-06T18:07:12", "title": "Is The Economy Still The Most Important Thing For Trump\u2019s Reelection?", "text": "The U.S. economy lost 700,000 jobs in March, while more than 10 million Americans filed unemployment claims. The economy is tumbling in the wake of the coronavirus, and now there\u2019s a very real possibility that we\u2019re on the verge of a recession.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know \u2014 including the severity and the length of the downturn we currently find ourselves in \u2014 but the economic outlook in the next few months could play an outsized role in President Trump\u2019s reelection chances this November. It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint how the economy might matter this time around, but historically, economic conditions have been of consequence in presidential elections. However, that might be less true now, given how increasingly polarized and partisan American politics are.\n\nFor a long time now, political science has found a positive relationship between consumer sentiment and a president\u2019s approval rating. That is, the more optimistic Americans are about the economy, the higher a president\u2019s approval tends to be. But now there are signs that is no longer the case. Trump\u2019s approval rating, for instance, doesn\u2019t really track with views of the economy \u2014 it\u2019s lower than you\u2019d expect. The same disconnect was true during former President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, leaving some political scientists to conclude partisan loyalties might now be more important than anything else \u2014 even the strength of the economy \u2014 in evaluating presidential performance.\n\nConsider Trump\u2019s incredibly steady approval rating. Despite plenty of drama \u2014 remember impeachment? \u2014 his approval rating has barely budged. In fact, he has the steadiest presidential approval rating of any president since World War II. Trump\u2019s approval rating has generally fallen within a very narrow 5-point band, hovering between 40 percent and 45 percent. Obama is the only other president with a similarly narrow range \u2014 his approval rating fell between 45 and 50 percent about half of the time.\n\nMuch of what we\u2019re seeing here can be explained by ever-increasing partisan polarization. In fact, the growing divide between Republicans and Democrats is larger than at any other point in the last two decades, according to the Pew Research Center. Practically, what this has meant that a president like Trump gets sky-high ratings from Republicans (Gallup found 89 percent approved of him over the past year) and incredibly low ratings from Democrats (7 percent). Even a good economy doesn\u2019t move the needle as much because partisanship also increasingly influences how people judge economic conditions. For instance, Pew found earlier this year that 57 percent of Americans rated the economy as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood,\u201d but 81 percent of Republicans answered that way compared to just 39 percent of Democrats.\n\nChristopher Wlezien, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies how economic conditions influence presidential elections, told me that on average, elections tend to be \u201croughly half economics and half other stuff,\u201d but that may not be the case for Trump. \u201cGiven where his approval ratings are, where his poll performance is and where the economy has been, a lot of what\u2019s going on here is non-economic,\u201d Wlezien said, adding that strong partisanship is undoubtedly part of it. \u201cThe stronger [people] identify with parties, the less things like economic factors matter,\u201d Wlezien said.\n\nThat said, Trump has generally scored better on the economy than on other issues during his time in office, but similar to Obama, he hasn\u2019t really enjoyed a boost in his approval ratings despite overseeing \u2014 until very recently \u2014 the longest period of economic expansion in U.S. history.\n\nBut even though views of the economy are filtered through partisan views, we have recently seen that they aren\u2019t completely immune to bad news. The latest poll from The Economist/YouGov found that the share of Republicans who felt the economy was getting better had fallen 32 points, from 70 percent in early March to 38 percent. Only 7 percent of Democrats said it was getting better. That was in line with previous polls, but the drop in Republican expectations of the economy could be a bad omen for Trump. If Republicans\u2019 economic expectations sour enough, some of them might disapprove of Trump despite partisan attachments to him.\n\nYet it might not be as bad as it might seem for Trump, as it\u2019s possible that perceptions about the prospects for recovery will be more important than the current downturn. The media tends to focus more on the economy\u2019s future anyway and less on current economic conditions. So if the economy seems headed toward recovery after the worst of the crisis, that might play favorably in the court of public opinion. Not to mention, voters tend to take a more holistic view of the economy, accounting for as much as two years of past economic performance when voting in presidential contests \u2014 which could be good for Trump, as the economy had been pretty good for most of his time in office.\n\nNonetheless, the economy still might not be the most important factor in the November election: It could be primarily about Trump himself. \u201cAll the evidence seems to point to referendum judgments mattering a lot more when there\u2019s an incumbent than when there\u2019s not,\u201d Wlezien said. In fact, there is evidence that vote choice is unaffected by economic attitudes if an incumbent president is running. According to political science research, voter assessments of the economy are too closely linked to perceptions of the president and don\u2019t make that much of a difference, which, again, brings us back to partisanship and Trump\u2019s steady approval rating.\n\nIf there is evidence of economic recovery by the fall, the huge partisan gap in attitudes toward the economy may return to pre-crisis levels. And with that, the election might look much like it did only a few weeks ago: Democrats overwhelmingly supporting the Democratic nominee and Republicans overwhelmingly supporting Trump, with the economy not mattering much at all.", "author": ["Geoffrey Skelley"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-jobs-report-was-bad-the-next-one-will-be-worse/", "published": "2020-04-03T13:12:50", "title": "This Jobs Report Was Bad. The Next One Will Be Worse.", "text": "Well, it took 10 years, but the streak is over: There was a net loss of American jobs last month. That\u2019s putting it mildly, actually. Today, the first jobs report encompassing the economic fallout from COVID-19 was released and, predictably, it paints a dire picture. Overall, 701,000 fewer people are employed now than last month \u2014 the first time in a decade that number has declined. The unemployment rate \u2014 which has remained below 4 percent since January 2019 \u2014 has risen to 4.4 percent.\n\nBut this is just a glimpse of what\u2019s to come. Next month\u2019s report will almost certainly be far worse, and this month\u2019s will likely be revised down in the months to come.\n\nBut one thing we know with relative certainty: The situation will get worse before it gets better. The household survey, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to estimate the unemployment rate, was in the field the second week of March. While some businesses had already shut down temporarily by then, plenty of areas \u2014 some of the most populated areas, in fact \u2014 hadn\u2019t yet called for closures. Six counties in the Bay Area, for example, had yet to announce a shelter-in-place mandate, and New York Gov. Andrew Coumo had yet to \u201cput New York on pause,\u201d requiring all nonessential businesses to close down public-facing storefronts.\n\nSo, if you can, look beyond this month\u2019s job report and ask yourself: Just how bad will the next report be? And what will an economic recovery look like?\n\nUnemployment insurance claims, which are reported weekly, can help provide a sense of where we might be headed.\n\nAs the previous chart shows, there were 282,000 claims for the week the statistics bureau found an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent. After that, however, the number grew substantially. It stands to reason, then, that the true unemployment rate is much higher.\n\nOne piece of good news: Matt McDonald, a partner at the consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies who writes a monthly analysis of the jobs report, says we have reason to believe that job growth will be as dramatic as the fall. A typical economic recession\u2019s recovery takes a U shape. That is, job losses level off at the bottom for several months before the country eventually adds jobs again. He expects to see something closer to a V shape. \u201cI would guess that after the business closures get lifted, you\u2019re going to have a positive jobs report as a result of that \u2014 because you have to,\u201d McDonald said, citing the nature of businesses reopening all at once.\n\nIf the $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at helping those economically hurt by the coronavirus can offer enough leeway for businesses to wait this out, shops could rehire their staff as quickly as they let them go.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that the current stimulus packages will be enough, however. For any businesses running on thin margins, forgoing a few months of profit can be catastrophic. Even if they are financially equipped to do so, fear that the market will stay dicey might cause employers to act cautiously. \u201cYou\u2019ll have people moving into a defensive position in the economy, just assuming that this is going to be a longer fall,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cSo, you\u2019re going to have layoffs for that reason.\u201d\n\nBut, ultimately, we are still too far out to have any true grip on what kind of economic fallout we\u2019re facing. My former colleague Ben Casselman put it well on our politics podcast last week: \u201cWe\u2019re kind of flying blind here for a while in terms of the real impact of this.

But today\u2019s data from the Department of Labor painted a much, much bleaker picture for the job market. During the week ending on March 28, 6.6 million more people filed for unemployment insurance, double the number from last week and nearly 6 million more than the all-time high from before a week ago.\n\nMany of those claims were left over from a backlog of people unable to file during the initial wave of coronavirus-related layoffs. As we noted last week, state unemployment agencies have never needed to process anywhere near this many claims at once, and the strain was apparent in widespread reports that out-of-work Americans were struggling to file through computer glitches.\n\nBut this week\u2019s initial claims also reflect the ongoing vulnerability of American workers amid shelter-in-place orders and other social-distancing measures designed to slow the coronavirus\u2019s spread. According to research by economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, about 50 million jobs could eventually be lost due to the virus and the economic challenges it presents. These include jobs in sales, food preparation and other services, plus \u201chigh contact-intensive\u201d positions such as flight attendants and hairdressers.\n\nSo as the crisis wears on, initial unemployment claim numbers that once seemed unthinkable could become the norm.\n\n\u201cThese are very large numbers by historical standards,\u201d Faria-e-Castro wrote, \u201cbut this is a rather unique shock that is unlike any other experienced by the U.S. economy in the last 100 years.\u201d\n\nFaria-e-Castro did point out that the duration of this unemployment crisis also matters. And to that point, other economists have noted that a large number of these job losses could be erased once the virus clears and returning to work is feasible again \u2014 particularly since many of the unemployment claims are from workers who have been furloughed or only temporarily left unpaid.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC last week, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard predicted a boom in the overall economy once the pandemic subsides because of what he termed \u201cpent-up demand\u201d during the inactivity of social distancing. That would include, he said, a return to relatively normal unemployment numbers after the big spikes of this quarter.\n\nBut the simple truth is that experts \u2014 whether in economics or epidemiology \u2014 don\u2019t really know the ultimate trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly with regard to when cases will peak and tail off, a crucial factor for reopening the economy. It\u2019s an exceptionally difficult problem to model, as my colleagues Maggie Koerth, Laura Bronner and Jasmine Mithani wrote this week. And even if large numbers of the jobs lost this month are eventually restored, there\u2019s a good chance that this economic shock will still affect Americans\u2019 earnings for years to come, especially for recent graduates.\n\nFor now, that means economists will keep watching the unemployment figures as a way of gauging where we are in the crisis \u2014 and they\u2019ll keep readjusting their benchmarks to this new, never-seen-before normal.\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/would-it-hurt-the-economy-to-let-people-die-from-coronavirus/", "published": "2020-03-31T18:15:37", "title": "Staying Home Saves Lives.

On Thursday, a Department of Labor report showed that a record-shattering 3.3 million people applied for initial unemployment claims last week. And with entire industries shuttered for the foreseeable future, economic output will almost certainly shrink dramatically.\n\nAs economic forecasts grow darker, talk of tradeoffs is getting louder: Is protecting Americans from COVID-19 really worth all this disruption and economic pain?\n\nOn March 22, before President Trump floated the idea of reopening the economy by Easter, against the recommendations of his own public health experts, he tweeted, \u201cWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.\u201d Other politicians, meanwhile, rejected the idea that economic costs should be a factor at all. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo dismissed Trump\u2019s push to get the economy moving again, saying, \u201cNo American is going to say, \u2018accelerate the economy at the cost of human life.\u2019 Because no American is going to say how much a life is worth.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s sentiment might be a nice bit of political rhetoric, but it\u2019s not really true. Economists might not be able to say how much an individual person\u2019s existence is worth, but they have figured out a way to calculate how much the average person is willing to pay to reduce the risk of death \u2014 which allows them to put a price tag on the collective value of saving one life. That figure, which currently hovers somewhere around $9 or $10 million, is known as the \u201cvalue of statistical life,\u201d and it\u2019s the basis for all kinds of high-stakes decisions that involve tradeoffs between public safety and economic cost \u2014 from food and automobile regulations to our responses to climate change.\n\nAs cold-blooded as it might seem, several economists told me that, at least in theory, a pandemic is exactly the kind of situation this metric is designed to help with. \u201cEssentially, we\u2019re trying to figure out what our society is willing to pay to reduce the risk of mortality,\u201d said W. Kip Viscusi, an economist at Vanderbilt University and one of the leading experts on these calculations. \u201cIn that sense, a pandemic isn\u2019t so different from a terrorist attack or a pollutant that\u2019s threatening to kill large numbers of people \u2014 it\u2019s just happening very quickly and on a very large scale.\u201d\n\nThe idea that a life could have a monetary value isn\u2019t necessarily easy to swallow from an ethical perspective. Economists and government regulators have to balance the risk of death against all kinds of other factors, though, and the concept of the VSL was developed several decades ago because economists didn\u2019t like the idea of assigning that value through other, more intuitive means, like our contributions to the economy as workers. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly simple to value someone\u2019s life based on how much money they make,\u201d said Spencer Banzhaf, an economist at Georgia State University who has written about the history of the VSL. \u201cBut in addition to being baldly crude, that\u2019s just not reflective of the way we think about people. We don\u2019t think a retired person is worth nothing.\u201d\n\nThe VSL, instead of trying to sum up the value of a life, approaches the question from the other direction \u2014 how much are we willing to spend to reduce the odds of dying?\n\nEconomists draw the numbers from multiple sources, including surveys and assumptions about our own choices, like how much additional money people earn for especially dangerous jobs, or how much a premium they\u2019ll pay for a safer car. The estimates do vary, but they fall in the same basic range \u2014 the EPA\u2019s valuation falls around $9.4 million, while Viscusi\u2019s latest calculation is $10 million. To put it another way, Viscusi\u2019s estimate means that if a group of 10,000 people is facing a 1-in-10,000 risk of death, they\u2019re willing to pay $1,000 per person to reduce the odds that any given member of the community will die.\n\nThese numbers show why spending trillions of dollars to combat a threat like the coronavirus pandemic can be a good investment, despite the high cost. \u201cLet\u2019s say one of our worst-case scenarios comes to pass, and 2 million people die,\u201d said James Hammitt, an economist at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. \u201cMultiply that by $9 million or $10 million and we\u2019re talking about up to $20 trillion as the value of preventing those deaths. That suggests it\u2019s worth expending a fair amount of our resources to mitigate this.\u201d\n\nBut back-of-the-envelope calculations can obscure some of the knottier questions that plague economists who have studied this issue for decades. The VSL varies by country, because the wealth of the average person in a rich country like the United States is much higher than that of a person in a poorer country like India, which means Americans can \u201cpay\u201d more to avoid risk. That outcome is liable to make most people uncomfortable, and weighing the value of other types of lives \u2014 for example, the young versus the old \u2014 is tricky, too.\n\nFor example, even though the coronavirus appears to result in a much higher mortality rate for older people \u2014 prompting some politicians to propose that they should consider sacrificing themselves to save the economy \u2014 trying to put a lower price tag on their lives hasn\u2019t worked well in the past. Joseph Aldy, a public policy professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, said that under President George W. Bush, the EPA tried to put a lower value on the life of an older person in calculating the benefits of air quality regulations. In their analysis, the life of a person over the age of 70 was worth 37 percent less than the life of a younger person.\n\n\u201cIt was a political disaster,\u201d Aldy said. The policy was christened the \u201csenior death discount\u201d and in response, AARP ran ads featuring a picture of an elderly woman with a \u201c37 percent OFF!\u201d tag hanging from her glasses. The EPA backed off and never implemented the proposed changes.\n\nOutside the glare of the political spotlight, though, that experience hasn\u2019t stopped economists from exploring whether age-based valuations are right in some circumstances. There\u2019s evidence, Aldy said, that people\u2019s willingness to pay to reduce the risk of mortality starts to decrease after age 50. But those kinds of calculations, he added, are sometimes disconnected from the moral valuations we make collectively. \u201cWe spend the vast majority of our health care dollars on people over the age of 65, and yet one might say the age-adjusted value of statistical life for that population is lower,\u201d Aldy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of social compact \u2014 we recognize your contributions to our society and will provide the resources to keep you healthy as you age. So how far can this economic analysis really go when we\u2019ve made that decision as a society?\u201d\n\nAnd even accounting for age might not provide a compelling argument against the measures currently being taken in response to the pandemic. Two economists used age-adjusted VSL in a recent analysis of the economic cost of social distancing \u2014 and they still found that the public health response to coronavirus had \u201csubstantial economic benefits.\u201d\n\nThe sheer uncertainty of the coronavirus crisis is another problem \u2014 both in terms of the potential death toll and economic impact. Estimates of how many people might die in the U.S. are all over the place \u2014 some as low as 200,000, others as high as 2 million. And Banzhaf said that just as age-based calculations have their limitations, the scope of the economic costs has to go beyond earnings or GDP. \u201cDepending on how long this shutdown goes on, we\u2019re talking about a huge hit to the common good and our way of life,\u201d he said. \u201cIf symphonies, hotels, art galleries, restaurants close and can\u2019t come back \u2014 that\u2019s a loss that goes way beyond earnings dollars. I don\u2019t know how you begin to quantify it.\u201d\n\nIf anything, though, the uncertainty and fear of the coronavirus pandemic could drive the value of statistical life even higher. Studies have shown, Hammitt said, that because people are more afraid of flying on airplanes than driving in cars, they are willing to shell out for airplane safety measures. \u201cWe see the same thing with terrorism risk,\u201d Hammitt said. \u201cWhen a kind of death is more dreaded or ambiguous, people are willing to pay more to avoid dying that way.\u201d\n\nBut Aldy told me that cost-benefit analyses would have been most helpful at earlier stages of the crisis, when the government had the opportunity to invest in testing and surveillance. At this point, he told me, he wasn\u2019t sure why a cost-benefit analysis was needed to drive home the cost of a huge loss of life \u2014 particularly since he, like many other economists and public health experts, thinks that containing the virus is the best way to ensure the economy rebounds quickly.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say we\u2019re talking about 1 million deaths or 2 million deaths,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you think about the economic damage and the damage to families and communities all over the country, I don\u2019t think you need an egghead like me to try to put a price on that. It\u2019s catastrophic.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION (March 27, 2020, 12:35 p.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the odds required for 10,000 people being willing to pay $1,000 per person to reduce the odds that any given member of the community will die. It is 1-in-10,000 odds of dying, not 1-in-1,000.", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-3-million-americans-filed-for-unemployment-last-week-almost-5-times-the-record-high/", "published": "2020-03-26T14:15:20", "title": "3.3 Million Americans Filed For Unemployment Last Week, Almost 5 Times The Record High", "text": "Observers knew to brace themselves for historically bad news in Thursday\u2019s unemployment numbers from the Department of Labor. According to data going back to 1967, no previous week had ever seen more than 695,000 people newly filing for unemployment, but many analysts expected this week\u2019s number to rise into the millions.\n\nThose fears were realized: The DOL report for the week ending March 21 saw a staggering 3.3 million people file initial unemployment insurance claims in the wake of the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, 4.7 times the previous high.\n\nThat eye-catching number helps represent the tangible human scale of what the coronavirus \u2014 along with the social distancing measures taken to prevent its spread \u2014 has done to the economy over the past several weeks. And it is probably actually undercounting the true number of Americans out of work in the middle of this crisis.\n\nPolicies vary from state to state, but self-employed people such as independent contractors and freelancers are typically not eligible for unemployment benefits, nor are many part-time workers, depending on the number of hours they\u2019ve worked. (Though some states are relaxing these requirements during the coronavirus crisis.) In an economy that has increasingly shifted work away from full-time employees, the traditional measures of unemployment don\u2019t fully describe the scope of the devastation.\n\nAnd technological limitations are keeping even more out-of-work Americans from being counted in this measure. Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project (a nonprofit devoted to labor and employment advocacy), told me via email that many people who have tried to file claims so far have been unable to, even if they qualify for unemployment. Evermore said state unemployment agencies weren\u2019t set up to handle this volume of claims, and that has led to breakdowns in their filing systems. \u201cI think they have responded admirably, but computer failures and glitches have been widely reported,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThis implies that, on top of the current record-breaking numbers, the totals in future weeks could include a backlog of people who were unable to file their initial claims over the past few weeks. And that means more bad news to come in a statistic that is one of the bedrock indicators used by economists to gauge the state of the economy in real time.", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/unemployment-is-spiking-but-some-companies-are-actually-hiring/", "published": "2020-03-24T15:53:10", "title": "Unemployment Is Spiking, But Some Companies Are Actually Hiring", "text": "Though initial data about the coronavirus\u2019s effect on the United States job market is historically dire, not all sectors of the economy are hurting in equal measure. As a few of my colleagues wrote about last week, workers in the food and service industries (particularly in restaurants) are at a heightened economic risk during this crisis, since those businesses are inherently at odds with the type of social distancing edicts many states have issued. But at the same time, it stands to reason that some industries will actually be hiring more workers as the pandemic rages on.\n\nThe topline numbers, though, are undeniably bad. According to the Department of Labor, seasonally adjusted initial unemployment insurance claims leaped by 70,000 \u2014 to 281,000 total \u2014 for the week ending March 14. That number alone would be historic; only 13 weeks since 1967 have ever seen a week-over-week increase of 70,000 or more claims, and this is just the third time it\u2019s happened since 1996. But the numbers that will come out this week could be unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen. Analysts are projecting that the total number of initial claims for the week ending on March 21 could rise above 2 million, an unthinkably high number. (Since 1967, no single week had ever seen 700,000 initial claims, according to the Federal Reserve.)\n\nBut again, it can be easy to forget that not every sector of the economy is affected the same way by this tidal wave of unemployment. To get an early sense of where any additional jobs might come from, FiveThirtyEight reached out to Carrie Engel of Indeed, a job search and posting website. Indeed\u2019s analytics confirmed the overall direction of the federal job-market data above; through March 21, the year-over-year trend in job postings for the U.S. was down 7.2 percent. That could get worse before it gets better \u2014 the trend is down 18.2 percent from last year in Italy, a country that has instituted public lockdowns as its death toll rises. According to Indeed, U.S. postings in tourism and aviation are also significantly down from a year ago, reflecting other sectors of the economy that have been battered by travel bans and citizens generally staying inside.\n\nBut Indeed\u2019s numbers show a 5 percent increase in job postings for loading and stocking workers \u2014 warehouse jobs necessary for online delivery companies such as Amazon, which announced last week that it was opening 100,000 new roles and doubling down on shipments for coronavirus-related supplies. Of course, these numbers might be complicated by news of a confirmed coronavirus case in one of Amazon\u2019s warehouses and reports that package delivery workers are sick on the job.\n\nEngel also pointed to another area where Indeed had noticed an upward trend of job postings: medical jobs. \u201cPostings for jobs in the medical technician field, which includes titles such as medical assistant and laboratory technician, are growing faster this year, 7 percent above their trend at this point in 2019,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nShe also noted that, before the crisis, Indeed\u2019s data indicated fewer job seekers interested in medical positions than there had been just a few years earlier, particularly in metropolitan areas with a larger share of people aged 65 or older. Now, those health care workers are needed more than ever, which could lead to an increase in hiring.\n\nWhat about job postings in other industries that are more conducive to working from home, such as technology fields that are digital-only? Although Indeed hadn\u2019t taken a comprehensive survey yet, Engel said software development jobs are growing more slowly in 2020, with a posting trend about 2 percent lower than last year. So for now, there hasn\u2019t been a particular spike in hiring for at least one of the areas that might be able to expand, free of social-distancing constraints.\n\nOne unknown factor in the job equation could also be applied over the weeks to come: the Defense Production Act (DPA). We\u2019ve already seen some factories that make perfume and alcohol willingly convert production to health products currently in short supply, such as hand sanitizer. But the DPA gives the federal government wide latitude over private companies, including the ability to compel them to fill orders necessary for the national defense before completing their usual products. In theory, this would provide for mass industrial production of masks, gloves, ventilators and other medical equipment needed to manage the crisis. What is unclear is whether this ramp-up in production would also lead to the creation of more jobs or would simply reallocate existing workers to new tasks.\n\nBecause of the coronavirus, the overall job market looks bleak in a way we haven\u2019t seen in decades, if ever. But as businesses adjust to the new reality of the pandemic, it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on jobs numbers for sectors that either are directly involved in the fight against the virus or are poised to see more business with the public staying inside.", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stimulus-checks-arent-a-bad-idea-but-theyre-not-enough/", "published": "2020-03-23T19:29:25", "title": "Stimulus Checks Aren\u2019t A Bad Idea, But They\u2019re Not Enough", "text": "Congress is about to embark on a huge spending spree. Last Thursday, after the Trump administration announced that it supports a stimulus package to help individuals and businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic, Senate Republicans unveiled a massive spending bill that includes a controversial provision: direct cash payments to many Americans.\n\nThe legislation is still in flux, and Republicans and Democrats have clashed on the details of the payments, like who should get checks, whether they should go out more than once, and how much they should be for \u2014 but it seems likely that some form of direct cash relief will end up in the final package.\n\nOn the surface, the idea of sending checks to Americans stricken by a vast and sudden economic slowdown feels like a pretty obvious first step. The unemployment crisis is unfolding at a terrifying speed, and people need money. So why not simply give it to them? There\u2019s also some evidence that the checks are increasingly popular with Americans as the massive economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic comes into focus. A poll conducted March 16-17 by liberal think tank Data for Progress showed that support for $1,000 cash payments to Americans has skyrocketed since early March, with 58 percent of the country now in favor.\n\nBut is an influx of cash actually the best way to cushion workers from what seems likely to be the most dramatic shock in recent memory? The consensus, based on my conversations with almost a dozen economic experts, is that it can\u2019t hurt to go ahead and send out checks. But that probably shouldn\u2019t be our only \u2014 or even our primary \u2014 economic response. There are preexisting systems, like unemployment insurance programs, that can quickly get money to the people who are losing their jobs. And in the short term, focusing on shoring up those systems could be just as important as determining how big a windfall Americans should get in the mail.\n\n\u201cRight now, the risk of overreach is negligible and the risk of doing too little is very high,\u201d said Indivar Dutta-Gupta, the co-director of the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality. \u201cSo stimulus checks should really just be one part of a much broader effort to help the tens of millions of people who are going to be hurt economically by this pandemic.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, after the Senate Republicans\u2019 economic proposal was unveiled, Republican Sen. Richard Shelby questioned the value of sending out a slew of payments over a more targeted approach. \u201cI personally think that if we are going to help people, we ought to direct the cash payments maybe as a supplement to unemployment, not to the people that are still working every day,\u201d Shelby said. Extra funding for the unemployment system is one of the options Congress is considering.\n\nHe had a surprising amount of company among some of the left-leaning experts I spoke with, who said the unemployment insurance system needs a lot of help. \u201cI\u2019m not opposed to sending out checks, but it\u2019s not an especially efficient way of helping people right now,\u201d said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. \u201cWe have a system that is literally designed to help people who have become unemployed, so we should be focusing on making sure that system is capable of responding to the huge surge of people who are relying on it.\u201d\n\nShoring up the unemployment insurance system came up in almost every conversation I had. And that\u2019s because the system is already threatening to buckle as the number of people applying for unemployment benefits spikes. According to the Department of Labor, new filings for job losses rose 33 percent for the week ending on March 14. And that data doesn\u2019t even cover last week, when businesses across the country temporarily shuttered and a tidal wave of layoffs followed. The state offices that administer unemployment benefits are unprepared to meet the demand in multiple ways \u2014 across the country last week, websites crashed, phone lines jammed, and lines snaked outside unemployment offices. And many states don\u2019t have the funds to handle a surge in unemployment claims without assistance from the federal government.\n\nCongress already allocated $1 billion in funds to help states ramp up their capacity to dole out unemployment benefits in a bill that passed last week. But experts said there\u2019s a lot more that could be done to use the unemployment insurance system to get money to people quickly. For instance, only about 27 percent of unemployed Americans actually received benefits in 2016, in part because of the complicated maze of restrictions that people face when they apply. Some states are already starting to remove barriers \u2014 like waiting periods or some eligibility requirements \u2014 to ensure that more people qualify. During the last recession, the federal government also pitched in money to help cover the ballooning cost of the state unemployment insurance programs, and it seemed to pay off, according to studies that were conducted later.\n\nArindrajit Dube, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, suggested increasing the amount of money that recipients are eligible for, too. Right now, unemployment insurance only replaces between one-third and one-half of a person\u2019s income. In normal times, Dube said, the payments should be capped around 50 percent of workers\u2019 normal wages \u2014 if the benefits were more generous, people might not look very hard for another job. The trouble is that right now, we have the opposite problem. \u201cWe want people not to work for health reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for our purposes in this very specific and unique moment, having a generous payout accomplishes exactly what we want it to.\u201d\n\nPutting more money in Americans\u2019 pockets through stimulus payments could help too, Dube said \u2014 unless the checks simply can\u2019t get out to people as quickly as they need them. During the 2008 financial crisis, Congress sent a tax rebate out to many Americans, which is similar to what\u2019s being proposed now. A study conducted in the wake of the payments found that the rebates did raise consumer spending. But the checks didn\u2019t actually arrive at people\u2019s homes until several months after the legislation had passed, which could be a big problem for low-wage workers, who often have minimal savings.\n\nThere are other ways to get funds to low-income Americans, Dutta-Gupta told me \u2014 for example, by putting more money onto the cards that food stamp recipients use to buy groceries. Angela Rachidi, a Rowe scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, meanwhile, favors funneling money to poor families through an emergency version of the earned income tax credit, a subsidy that supplements the earnings of low-income workers when they file their taxes. \u201cThese are the people who are least likely to be able to work from home, and many of them are single parents, which means they may need to take time off work to watch their children,\u201d Rachidi said. \u201cWe already know they\u2019re vulnerable \u2014 why not focus on them first?\u201d\n\nThe problem with more targeted interventions is that, inevitably, they leave some people out. Freelancers and independent contractors working in the \u201cgig economy,\u201d for example, don\u2019t usually qualify for unemployment insurance. Part-time workers also can\u2019t get access to unemployment benefits in some states. And there are plenty of people who will be financially harmed by the economic shutdown, but who won\u2019t necessarily lose a job. \u201cThe economic need is going to be tremendous, and unemployment is only one piece of it,\u201d said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Century Foundation. \u201cSome people are graduating from college and might have trouble finding work. You might lose overtime or a bonus.\u201d\n\nBut Stettner added that from his perspective, the stimulus checks are only one piece of the puzzle. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one single way to shore up people\u2019s incomes right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be broad and targeted. On its own, a $1,000 check is not going to solve many people\u2019s problems right now.\u201d", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-is-hitting-restaurants-hard-even-in-states-that-havent-shut-them-down/", "published": "2020-03-19T18:58:25", "title": "Coronavirus Is Hitting Restaurants Hard, Even In States That Haven\u2019t Shut Them Down", "text": "Across the country the number of COVID-19 cases are increasing \u2014 and the number of restaurant patrons are plummeting.\n\nTake Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine was the first governor in the country to shutter bars and restaurants statewide, forcing patrons to dine at home. But even before DeWine\u2019s March 15 order, restaurants were already feeling the impact of the coronavirus as customers began to avoid crowded areas in their cities.\n\nThat chart shows the year-over-year change in seated diners, according to data from OpenTable, an online restaurant reservation platform. OpenTable services almost 60,000 restaurants worldwide, including 35 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., and while its data is not a random sample it does offer a glimpse into what\u2019s happening in the restaurant industry nationwide. And what\u2019s happening is not good.\n\nMany restaurants are now paralyzed. Governors across the country have issued executive orders restricting or prohibiting seated dining in restaurants \u2014 33 states so far, though all of the states are allowing take-away or delivery orders. The majority of these closures have come on the heels of updated guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending people avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people.\n\nBut no matter whether the governor has issued an order or not, restaurants in every state available in the OpenTable data set have experienced declining dining attendance over the last two weeks. As public pleas for social distancing get louder, diners are forced to order food for take-away or delivery, or simply to cook at home.\n\nDiminishing clientele \u2014 and the diminishing profits that result \u2014 make it unsustainable for many restaurants to stay open and maintain fixed costs, let alone continue to pay wages. Some restaurants prepared to close even before the shutdowns took effect, citing consideration for the health and safety of the community.\n\nThose that try to stay open have been fighting against a whiplash of regulatory changes. Restaurants in New York City, for example, which were told they had to cut capacity by 50 percent on March 13. Just three days later, they were forced to close their doors to diners altogether. Restaurateur David Chang, owner of the worldwide Momofuku restaurant group, noted the absurdity in drumming up a new, pared-back business model in the midst of a crisis and mocked the idea that pick-up and delivery would be a Band-Aid for forced closures.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret many workers in the food and beverage and service industries live paycheck to paycheck and, as my colleagues pointed out this week, are among the most vulnerable in an economic crisis. And filing for unemployment can be a tedious process, because waiting periods and benefits vary state by state. Many business owners are still struggling to decide whether to furlough, lay off or hold on to employees in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, which only creates more uncertainty for Americans about next steps. Amendments to the current process for filing unemployment (like these in North Carolina or these in New York) will be vital for the wave of workers who have lost their jobs.\n\nAs states continue to order restaurant closures, we\u2019ll almost certainly see more abrupt drops in patronship like we saw in Ohio. To soften the economic blow, advocacy and nonprofit groups are calling for relief funds and resources to support laid-off workers and small business owners. But without tax relief or other forms of economic forgiveness from local and federal governments, it\u2019s unclear how many will once again open their doors.\n\nHow should you social distance?", "author": ["Anna Wiederkehr"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-workers-are-most-vulnerable-to-the-economic-costs-of-the-coronavirus/", "published": "2020-03-18T15:53:31", "title": "Which Workers Are Most Vulnerable To The Economic Costs Of The Coronavirus?", "text": "Kolby Ledbetter, 25, began worrying about the new coronavirus a few weeks ago, when it became clear that it was starting to spread in the United States. He works two jobs \u2014 a full-time job as an Americorps service member in Chicago and a part-time job at a bar \u2014 and at first, his main concern was for his health, since he doesn\u2019t have paid leave at his bar job or health insurance to fall back on.\n\nThen on Sunday afternoon, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced that all bars and restaurants would be shut down for dine-in customers through the end of March. The bar where Ledbetter works closed the next day, leaving him with a whole new set of worries. \u201cEven before all of this coronavirus stuff, I had a lot of financial anxiety because I was basically living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have a lot of worry about my health, but I\u2019m also terrified about my ability to stay afloat financially even if I don\u2019t get sick.\u201d\n\nWhy we shouldn\u2019t hope COVID-19 is seasonal like the flu\n\nAs dramatic measures to tamp down the spread of the virus are implemented across the country, workers like Ledbetter will likely be among the first to feel the economic effects. Big retailers like Gap and Columbia Sportswear are cutting their hours or shutting down entirely in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. And bars and restaurants have also been closed or restricted in a number of states beyond Illinois. On Monday, President Trump urged Americans in a press conference to avoid congregating in groups of more than 10 people.\n\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers like Ledbetter could be especially hard hit economically by the coronavirus, as part-time workers, very young or old workers, and workers in the lowest quartile of earnings are disproportionately likely to work in service industry or sales jobs.\n\nMartha Ross, a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution who studies the labor market, told us that workers like Ledbetter have few economic protections right now. \u201cThere are a lot of folks who don\u2019t get paid leave if they get sick. They probably can\u2019t work remotely, so they\u2019re more likely to get sick if they do go to work,\u201d said Ross. \u201cAnd even if they don\u2019t get the virus, they\u2019re still at higher risk of losing their jobs or having their hours cut. They\u2019re vulnerable no matter what happens.\u201d\n\nCrises have a way of exposing inequalities that linger uncomfortably below the surface when times are good. A few groups of workers are particularly likely to lack both paid leave and the ability to work from home: part-time workers, the youngest and oldest people in the workforce (those under the age of 25 and over the age of 65) and workers who fall below the 25th percentile of earnings.\n\nWho is economically vulnerable to the coronavirus?

Workers over the age of 65 \u2014 who are also at elevated risk of a life-threatening infection because of their age \u2014 only make up about 5 percent of people with jobs, for instance. But part-time workers make up about 20 percent. Some of these groups may overlap \u2014 young workers, for example, are disproportionately likely to be part-time workers \u2014 but they still represent a sizable chunk of the country\u2019s workforce.\n\nMany of these workers are employed in jobs that will be hard-hit by the recent wave of closures and cancellations, too. Almost one-third of part-time workers are employed in the service industry, which includes people who work in food preparation, and 25 percent work in sales. About 40 percent of workers under the age of 25 are employed in service or sales, too. Other research suggests that contingent workers \u2014 independent contractors, freelancers, or other people who work in the \u201cgig economy\u201d \u2014 are disproportionately likely to be affected, since they\u2019re more likely to be young and to work part-time. And they typically have no access to paid leave or other benefits because their employment is only temporary. They also tend to make less than workers in traditional, permanent jobs.

She has the money to cover her rent for April, but says she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019ll do if the entertainment industry remains shuttered. \u201cI have no idea how to get income.\u201d\n\nAnd Taylor is not alone. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad week to be a waiter, or a cashier, or any kind of contractor whose work relies on in-person interaction,\u201d said Jesse Rothstein, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThose people are going to see dramatic cuts to their income \u2014 their hours might be reduced, or they might lose their jobs altogether.\u201d\n\nTaken together, all of these factors create a bleak outlook, no matter what happens next. People who don\u2019t have access to paid leave and the ability to work remotely are disproportionately likely to be low-income, which means if their workplace isn\u2019t shuttered, they\u2019re more likely to keep coming to work out of necessity, even if they\u2019re not feeling well. That can put them at greater risk of being infected, since their coworkers may be doing the same thing. Research has found some workers in the food service industry kept coming to work even though they had symptoms of norovirus because they were afraid of losing their job or leaving their coworkers short-staffed.\n\nAnd the possibility that many will lose their jobs or have their hours cut because of the coronavirus creates a whole new set of problems. A survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation from March 11 to 15 found that 73 percent of workers with a household income of less than $40,000 a year, 68 percent of part-time workers, and 60 percent of self-employed workers are worried that they will lose income due to a workplace closure or reduced hours because of the coronavirus. According to that survey, part-time and self-employed workers are likelier than full-time or salaried workers to say they\u2019ve already lost income so far.\n\nIf the shutdowns persist, some employers may go out of business, leaving workers who weren\u2019t permanently laid off with no job to return to. \u201cWe have to start thinking about what\u2019s going to happen when people can\u2019t pay their rent or mortgage,\u201d Rothstein said. \u201cBecause these workers are going to start burning through their savings \u2014 if they have any at all.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION (March 18, 2020, 4:26 p.m.): A previous version of this article gave an incorrect number for the share of part-time workers. About 20 percent of people with one job work part time, not 22 percent.", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux", "Ryan Best"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-to-your-mail-order-mattress-after-you-return-it/", "published": "2020-02-19T16:56:30", "title": "What Happens To Your Mail-Order Mattress After You Return It", "text": "Earlier this year, I noticed something curious: four Craigslist ads, selling the same brand of mattress, using nearly the same text, at the same location, but illustrated with different photographs. Let\u2019s just say it doesn\u2019t take a crack journalistic mind to suspect something odd was happening.\n\nSo this journalistic mind responded to all the ads. What I found was a story that went beyond mattresses in Minneapolis. More Americans are buying more stuff online, a trend driven partly by free and easy return policies. But as retailers sell more, they also end up with more items being sent back \u2014 creating a long, winding logistical trail that can very easily end up at the city dump.\n\nThe problem only gets more complicated when the thing being sold is a large, awkward block of heavy foam. Many, many online bed-in-a-box retailers have sprung up in recent years. The first of these companies popped up around 2010. Today, there are dozens of them, and as mattress-in-a-box companies proliferate like so many bedbugs, they\u2019re finding themselves with a waste problem.\n\nPart of what has made these companies successful is their return policies, said J. Andrew Petersen, a professor of marketing at Penn State University. In the early 2000s, his research demonstrated that returns weren\u2019t necessarily bad for business. His work tracked sales data for a catalog clothing company over six years and found that as customers returned more items, they also purchased more \u2014 even as they also were receiving fewer of the company\u2019s catalogs in the mail because of their return habits. There are limits to this, he told me, but in his studies, return rates as high as 13 percent were actually associated with higher profits.\n\nThese findings coincided with an easy-return era in online sales. That\u2019s driven a massive growth in both direct-to-consumer sales and returns, said Paula Rosenblum, managing partner of Retail Systems Research, a market analysis firm. Between 2010 and 2015, returns across the U.S. and Canada increased by 66 percent, according to the U.S. Postal Service. But while shopping got more convenient, \u201creturned\u201d hasn\u2019t always meant \u201cresold.\u201d When items come back to a retailer, they have to be sorted and repackaged, which costs money, and retailers might not be able to resell them at full price. \u201cHow much are you willing to pay for margins so slim?\u201d Petersen said. The result: As much as 5 billion pounds of stuff just thrown out every year.\n\nWhich brings us back to my mattress adventure. Most mattress-in-a-box companies have offered free, simple returns during a long \u201ctry it out\u201d period. If you don\u2019t like the bed, you can return it and get your money back. Seems easy, so I tried it.\n\nI had bought a mattress from a company called Tulo, but wanted to swap a medium-firmness model for a firm one. Which is how I found that, at least for this company, \u201creturning\u201d the unwanted mattress really just meant something more along the lines of \u201cWe\u2019d prefer you donate it, but do what you want with it.\u201d And this is the problem with lenient return policies for mattresses that arrive at customers\u2019 house vacuum packed into a narrow tube. You can\u2019t stuff this particular genie back into the bottle.\n\nI ended up on Craigslist looking at mattresses because I wanted to know if I could resell mine. The four ads I found \u2014 for Purple brand mattresses at half their retail price \u2014 told me resale was possible. But something weird was going on.\n\nAt the other end of those eerily identical ads I found a single seller \u2014 an independent agent for a new kind of company that\u2019s aiming to solve the mattress companies\u2019 problems and reduce landfill waste. Called Sharetown, it works kind of like Uber and Lyft: A mattress company contracts with Sharetown to handle returns and, when one pops up, Sharetown connects the customer with an nearby agent who takes the mattress off their hands, cleans it up, and markets it for sale on local community sites like Facebook and Craigslist. When the mattress sells, everybody gets a cut \u2014 the agent, Sharetown and the company that originally sold the mattress.\n\nCody Hunter, founder and CEO of Sharetown, said it doesn\u2019t compete with new sales because generally the people buying a used mattress aren\u2019t the people who are willing to pay full price. He sees it more like allowing the company to reach customers they\u2019d otherwise never be able to get. Sharetown has partnerships with multiple mattress companies, including Purple, Layla, Nest, Helix, Luma and Nature\u2019s Sleep.\n\nWhile clothing returns have driven growth in a secondhand industry that\u2019s now big enough to be releasing market reports, mattresses have presented more complex logistics. The brands that work with Sharetown aren\u2019t the only ones who\u2019ve had to think outside the box. To make sure its unwanted mattresses go to charity, Tuft & Needle has developed an in-house logistics system and partners with a network of over 250 partner charities, said Melanie LaDue, the company\u2019s giveback lead. When a customer wants to return a mattress, Tuft & Needle sets them up with one of those partners and only processes the refund after the customer uploads a picture of their donation receipt.\n\nIdeally, this system runs smoothly, with mattresses being picked up for free and taken to people in need. But that\u2019s not always the case, LaDue told me. \u201cIn California, a lot of charities can\u2019t accept a used mattress,\u201d she told me. \u201cNew York is another tricky area because charities aren\u2019t willing or able to go into the city for pickup.\u201d In those situations, all the company can do is encourage customers to donate to friends and family or, if all else fails, spend some of its own money to hire a waste removal company \u2014 which may mean at least part of the mattress will go to a landfill.\n\nIt\u2019s not business as usual for retail sales companies to contract out to secondhand dealers or build a charity logistics arm, but avoiding the landfill takes more than just good intentions.\n\nCORRECTION (Feb. 20, 2020, 11:40 a.m.): A previous version of this article inaccurately said that the online mattress sales were a $29 billion industry. That is a 2017 valuation of the entire mattress industry, not just the online sector. Online sales are now about 14 percent of the total domestic mattress market. Also, this article said online sales were worth 20 times as much in 2019 as they had been in 2014. That was an estimate of sales for six companies, not an industrywide measure.

GB WhatsApp and WhatsApp plus are the mods which are extremely popular. Both mods are an amazing alternative to WhatsApp. So which one should you use? For clearing g your confusions we are going to compare: GB WhatsApp vs WhatsApp Plus.\n\nWhatsApp is the most used social messenger in the world, With a Footfall of around 1.2 billion per day. However, most people are shifting from the convention WhatsApp to its mods like GB WhatsApp and WhatsApp plus. This is mainly because of the new features being given by the mods. Features like extended memory booster, amazing themes, and customizable icons have led to the popularity of GB WhatsApp and WhatsApp plus.\n\nFeatures of WhatsApp Plus\n\nWhatsApp plus is one of the most used mods of original WhatsApp. As it runs over the original WhatsApp app, it doesn\u2019t require much space and is also 100% secure. You do not need to download any additional file or root your device for using WhatsApp plus. This is a very big plus point.\n\nWhatsApp Plus comes with a theme store which offers more than 700 types of themes. Besides, you get a wide range of emojis. It even includes the latest emoji layouts like that of Google Hangout. Apart from these emojis of most other social media messengers are included in WhatsApp plus.\n\nHide your online status. Chat with your loved ones anonymously without letting anyone know. Many people don\u2019t like to show their online status while being online. Original WhatsApp doesn\u2019t allow you to hide the status while you are really online. WhatsApp plus offers you this amazing offer.\n\nYou can edit the icons shape, size, and colour. Besides, you can also change the notification type and settings. Which gives WhatsApp plus an upper hand.\n\nGB WhatsApp Features\n\nJust like WhatsApp plus you can download additional themes on GB WhatsApp and customize the look of WhatsApp. The app is user-friendly and easy to use. Although being a really complex software it is very easy to use at the front end. GB WhatsApp is safe and secure but has a bit fewer features than WhatsApp plus.\n\nOne feature which makes GB WhatsApp better than WhatsApp plus is the two-factor enabled lock. Nowadays only the lock screen isn\u2019t sufficient for protecting your files. Hence you get an in-app option to lock the WhatsApp.\n\nYou can send up to 350 pictures at a time and up to 100 documents, unlike normal WhatsApp. Also, send high-resolution pictures with the highest network speed of GB WhatsApp.\n\nGB WhatsApp vs Whatsapp plus: Detailed Comparison?\n\nBoth GB WhatsApp and WhatsApp plus has almost the same features. However, you get a bit more features in WhatsApp plus like a custom theme store, unlike GB WhatsApp which has only a limited number of themes.\n\nIn GB WhatsApp you get additional features like in-app locker and more file sending capacity. Both the mods are built upon the original WhatsApp. Hence both are equally secure. However in WhatsApp plus you get a wider range of emojis than GB WhatsApp. One downside of GB WhatsApp is that it does not allow you to change the icon looks. However WhatsApp plus allows change of icon packs and also provides a wide range of emojis. The network speed of GB WhatsApp is better than WhatsApp plus, which allows you to share documents and media at a faster rate.\n\nGB WhatsApp is more like normal WhatsApp with only a few more features. WhatsApp plus on the other hand lets you customize the whole look from icon to the interior. Hence, is better for people who are looking to change the entire look their WhatsApp. In our comparison of GB WhatsApp vs WhatsApp plus, we found that if you like more customisations then WhatsApp plus is for you.

This ring of gas is slowly growing within the depths of many other fast moving gas filaments and left over dust after a supernova. This sighting allowed a team of expert researchers headed by Frederic Vogt, to monitor the neutron that is deemed to be the first ever isolated star that has low magnetic field found beyond our Milky Way galaxy.\n\nFrederic Vogt and his team of researcher discovered that the ring of gas was located on an X-ray source which had been distinguished years before. However, this source continued to be unknown. It wasn\u2019t clear whether really lies behind it or in the remnant. It was only when this ring of gas- that includes oxygen and neon- was seen with MUSE which the team of researcher seen it perfectly.\n\nThe concurrence was extremely great; they realized that this must lie in the supernova leftover itself. If the location of the said images gathered was recognized, the team utilized X-ray annotations of this from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in order to settle on that it should be a remote neutron star that has a low magnetic field.\n\n\u201cIf you look for a point source, it doesn\u2019t get much better than when the Universe quite literally draws a circle around it to show you where to look. \u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vogt.\n\nWhen huge stars blow up, they leave a curdled trap of dust and hot gas, or also known as \u201csupernova remnant\u201d. These unstable structures are keys to heavier elements of redistribution that are plotted by huge stars as they live and pass on- within the interstellar medium, wherein they form new planets and stars.\n\nLisBarlett, co author and an ESO Fellow based in Chile, summarize this finding stating that. \u201cThis is the first object of its kind to be confirmed beyond the Milky Way, made possible using MUSE as a guidance tool.

This is what the study conducted by Ruhr Universitat Bochum astronomers under the sponsorship of Dr Ralf-Jurgen Dettmar discovered. The findings have been generated following the data analysis with high-tech and up to date radio telescopes. On the other hand, Rubin, science magazine of the said university posted a report relating to the research project.\n\nAccording to Prof Dr Ralf Jurgen Dettma,\u201d Galaxies such as our Milky Way are comparatively flat objects, which we must visualize as discs. \u201cIt had been unspecified in the past that the magnetic fields are blocked in the disc.\u201d he added. On the other hand, based on statistics and facts collected at the Jansky Very Large Array, North America\u2019s state of the art telescope facility, astronomers have confirmed that this isn\u2019t really the case. Same as the magnetic field that surrounds our planet, galactic magnetic field makes bigger from the disc to the intergalactic medium, like for example into the space that is between galaxies.\n\nSupernova Produce Magnetic Fields\n\nThese galactic magnetic fields are created by means of many stellar explosions, the impacts of that last for about millions of years. Energy ruptures of entire supernovas put as one produces a galaxy\u2019s magnetic field. Because of the fact that the explosions of stellar are chaotic procedures, experts and scientists hadn\u2019t anticipated them to produce a magnetic field with a neat, orderly as well as arranged structure on a huge scale. On the other hand, this is precisely what they\u2019ve now confirmed to be the situation in many galaxies, even if the in order and systematic structured didn\u2019t manifest in each single object. The basic and underlying mechanisms haven\u2019t yet been totally understood.\n\nThe Digitalization Make Analysis Easier and Simpler\n\nIt took digitalization system in order to enable investigation and study. Digitalization has made it likely to merge the facts and statistics of many radio antennas and, as a result, to carry out a better sensitivity and in a wider frequency band.\n\nThe statistics upon that the current examination is derived were accumulated in year 2011 and the year 2012.

This testing cargo is one of the testing devices that serve for a longer duration in the space environment. The US Airforce has remained to be a technology demonstrator, according to a professor in the National Security Affairs Department in Rhode Island, Joan Freese. The space plane is said to pursue more vigorously.\n\nThe unpiloted spacecraft will remain to be a reusable craft but most experts believe that the spacecraft will land back on Earth. All prior missions have landed back to Earth at the Air Force base in California. All of the X-37B missions have set its new duration record from the program. The second mission has begun last March 5, 2011, and last until June 16, 2012, and went back to Earth after 468 days of travel in the orbit.\n\nAnother OTV-3 took u nearly 675 days to complete its orbit before it finally came back on October 17, 20114. Another OTV-4 also conducted its orbital experiments for 718 days on orbit. The mission has been extended in space for its OTV program for about 2, 085 days. The Air Force agency managed to send their spacecraft in orbit with the use of its risk-reduction experimentation; it has come up to the development of the more vehicle technologies.\n\nThe X-37B program is consisting of the two reusable vehicles and both of these vehicles are built by Boeing. Looking slowly to the miniature of the NASA\u2019s space shuttle orbiter, the space plane measured 29 feet and 9.6 feet tall and consists of a wingspan of 15 feet. On the orbit done by the spacecraft, it was seen that it significantly has the higher inclination, unlike the previous OTV missions. The final orbit may take the space plane to have a more 60 degree.

Space business is one of the areas of business that continues to boom. The Geospatial analytics is an industry that tracks everything with the use of satellites from food production to retail.\n\nMost of the companies working on the technology have attracted huge money. Many orbital insights have funded more than $50 million last year and while one of the well-known labs has attracted $3o million and some have raised $4 million. James Crawford, one of the industry\u2019s pioneers and has worked for NASA for many years has also found his orbital insights last 2013.\n\nMost of these orbital insights are said to be the large storage of containers and it can provide data to many orbital enthusiasts. Descartes Labs, one of the leading and well-known satellite lab has started its career last 2014. With the lab\u2019s insights in using the AI process amount of satellite data, the first application of the technology was seen in the model of the US corn production. These cornfields are great for satellites when it comes to the resolution of the image. Since cornfields are big, using satellites are highly recommended.\n\nMost of the satellites are used to locate the fields, and to find out how the crops are growing and to assess the crops\u2019 cultivation and their production level. The space agency, SpaceKnow is now building its economic indexes with the use of the earth\u2019s imagery observation blending with other related data. It tracks industrial facilities all the way to China and generates the index of its manufacturing activities.\n\nThe Vice President of the Space Agency SpaceKnow Hugh Norton Smith said that their company aims to make the physical world and index into a digital platform. According to Crawford, he believes that the satellite imagery is made to improve and to make meaning quicker and to have a more accurate and cheaper insight.\n\nToday, more and more space agencies from around the world are planning to launch their own spacecraft. China and India are two countries planning to set up their own space stations by the year 2020. It was also expected that Japan will be constructing the very first elevator to outer space by the year 2024.

Once again, NASA is leading the way in innovative space technology. The agency begins to invest in groundbreaking technology concepts.\n\nThis includes space tech swarms, meteoroid impact detection and mapping technologies for small orbital debris. NASA is hoping that these technologies will one day be used for future space explorations.\n\nFollowing this project, the agency selected 26 space technology proposals still in its early stage. NASA sees a potential to these ideas, seeing that it will transform future space missions and introduce new capabilities for exploration.\n\nOne of the two major groundbreaking technologies chosen by NASA is the Biobots. This is designed for more innovative offloading of astronauts for space exploration. In the design of spacesuits for space exploration, there is no more important parameter than the weight on the back.\n\nWhile on space, the wearer has to support the weight of the suit system. The suit\u2019s added weight as well as portable life support system (PLSS) drives the astronaut\u2019s exertion level. Ultimately, this sets limitations on the astronaut\u2019s EVA duration and the distance they can travel on foot.\n\nIt generally hampers the exploration mission\u2019s productivity. NASA sees that Biobots has the potential to improve exploration activities on planets\u2019 surfaces greatly if astronauts no longer need to carry a PLSS. This NIACC proposal solves two things that restrict planetary surface explorations.\n\nAstronauts will no longer need to carry a PLSS for life support. Furthermore, the limitations on mobility, access, as well as operational capabilities will no longer be. Biobots is able to accomplish this by the application of state-of-the-art robotic systems.\n\nThese robotic systems will handle astronaut\u2019s biological requirements such as life support. The proposal highlighted a design reference scenario where the astronauts will be able to continue on planetary explorations for weeks or even months instead of only days.\n\nBased on this scenario, each astronaut will have a BioBot accompanying it. The BioBot transports their consumables and life support system. An extended umbilical reel connects the BioBot with the astronaut.\n\nThe robotic system can control the motion and direction of the umbilical. With the BioBot connected to the astronaut, they will have access to a small emergency life support system the same as those inside a PLSS.\n\nThe advantage of the robotic systems is they allow the astronaut to anywhere and can transport utilities. Biobots is one of the visionary ideas included in NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Phase I.

From the launch pad on South America\u2019s northern shore, Ariane 5 took off riding an almost 3 million pounds of thrust. Onboard the rocket is a guidance computer that guides its twin solid rocket boosters. The guidance computer steered the rocket\u2019s boosters to spin their exhaust nozzle for the launcher to move towards the east of Guiana Space Center.\n\nThe center is a French-managed, European-funded spaceport close to Kourou, French Guiana. About two and a half minutes into the rocket\u2019s flight, its solid-fueled boosters burned out and discarded. Associates of the Italian company Avio was the main manufacturers behind the boosters. Similarly, Ruag Space from Switzerland built the rocket\u2019s nose fairing. It dropped away about a minute after the launcher\u2019s flight.\n\nAccording to the range operation\u2019s manager from the space center, Arian 5 stayed on the right course as it headed to the space above the Atlantic Ocean. At around 9 minutes after liftoff, the launcher\u2019s main engine \u2013 a core stage Vulcain 2 engine made by the French \u2013 shut down and detached. Around the same time, the HM7B upper stage made by the German ignited.\n\nIt consumed a mix of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen igniting for about 16 minutes until to it placed Hylas 4 and DSN 1/Superbird 8 into ta elliptical geosynchronous transfer orbit. When Ariane 5 reached the orbit, it released DSN 1/Superbird 8, the Japanese satellite, about 28 minutes into launch. The launcher dumped a composite structure just a few minutes later, which revealed the European satellite Hylas 4.\n\nAccording to Arianespace, Hylas 4 satellite was deployed about 34 minutes after launch. Stephane Israel, chair, and chief executive of Arianespace declared success for Ariane 5\u2019s mission moments after deployment of Hylas 4. Israel announced the successful and flawless performance of Ariane 5 in carrying its mission.\n\nAriane 5\u2019s Thursday mission came about two months after the rocket\u2019s January mission. Its last mission came off target, which investigators determined that launcher\u2019s programmed coordinates put the rocket about 20 degrees off course the intended trajectory.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/04/16/nasa-plans-to-extend-boeings-first-flight-to-the-iss/", "published": "2020-04-16T13:10:10", "title": "NASA Plans to Extend Boeing\u2019s first flight to the ISS \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "NASA\u2019s Boeing\u2019s first crewed flight all the way to the International Space Station will take longer than the planned period of time. The mission may also include extra crew member to have a long ride too. The Starliner vehicle of the company is expected to take the astronauts of NASA to the ISS for the very first time this year and will be in space for a couple of weeks.\n\nThe Space agency is also considering the extension of the voyage for the next six months. And instead of sending two persons on the spacecraft, the space agency decided to send a third astronaut to be added to the group as well. The addition of astronaut will complete the first crewed trip of the Starliner which was planned to be a test flight only. As part of the NASA\u2019s Crew Program, both the SpaceX and Boeing have developed their private vehicles to transport most of their astronauts from back and forth to the ISS. Before these companies conduct the test flight ad their full mission to space, NASA aims to conduct their space flight to the ISS first. The test flight will be done in two types: one with a crew and the other one without a people on it.\n\nThe full operation of the mission is expected to last for several months and will have a crew on board. Now, the flight crewed by Boeing is looking for more mission and the Starliners Space Agency is qualified to conduct their mission. NASA is relying on its Commercial Crew partners to take all of their astronauts from coming back and forth to the International Space Station.\n\nA longer test of the mission is expected to be done by NASA for the next months. According to NASA, this could lead to a more microgravity research and maintenance to the ISS. However, Boeing is said to be prepared for the change. Although there are some concerns regarding the support of the month-long missions of the Boeing and SpaceX, these two giant companies are still certified for the crew missions this year. After the test was done, this could take for about six months before these companies are ready to start their space missions again. Chances that some of the space missions will be delayed too. However, by turning the Boeing\u2019s mission into their full mission, the NASA hopes to take all the potential gaps in accessing to the International Space Station.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/04/16/new-startup-plans-to-launch-space-hotels-by-2022/", "published": "2020-04-16T12:10:10", "title": "New Startup Plans to Launch Space Hotels by 2022 \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "Orion Span just launched its luxury plans last day. The Aurora Station is the first orbital community ever made. The space hotel will be launched in the year 2021 and will be recognized as the world\u2019s first ever luxury hotel in space.\n\nBy the year 2022, the hotel is expected to host astronauts, tourists, and space research on the Aurora Station according to the CEO Frank Bunger. Since the company is not a rocket company, they will rely on other rocket companies to transport their customers into the orbit. The company is planning to partner up with the well-known Blue Origin, SpaceX, or other space agency. The company also plans to look for a partner is looking for a place to launch their modules.\n\nWhile the company doesn\u2019t have any facility and spot to build the Aurora Station, the company says that they will probably arrive at their final decision in the next 7 months to 9 months. However, Orion does not stop from just painting pictures that will be seen on their official website. The company is also excited about their very first space hotel which is expected to operate in the year 2022. Arriving at the Aurora Station will make every space tourist greeted and enjoy their stay in the world\u2019s first luxury space hotel.\n\nOrion also hopes to attract more clients to purchase their tickets that may cost $9.5 million. This opportunity is said to be loved by people who are looking for an extraordinary experience. This can also mean for many governments who are looking for an opportunity for their space program a boost. This can also catch the interest of the real estate.\n\nAs of the moment, the company has only six employees and Bunger does not have any direct experience in space. The company Orion Span has joined other companies like the Bigelow Space. They are also planning to partner up with other space agencies in order to carry them in space and fulfill their luxury hotel. However, the company prioritizes the elegance first. It means that the company wants their hotel to be single mode volume which consists of 160 cubic meters. According to the company, the hotel is a single-module space station.\n\nThe Orion Span also announced that they will start collecting ticket deposits. The collection of the $80, 000 tickets will take a turn in Escrow and there are no announcements yet about the food.", "author": []}]}, "insidertradings": {"rss": "https://www.insidertradings.org/feed/", "link": "https://www.insidertradings.org/", "articles": []}, "truthfulreporter": {"rss": "https://truthfulreporter.com/feed/", "link": "https://truthfulreporter.com/", "articles": []}, "highlandmirror": {"rss": "http://www.highlandmirror.com/feed/", "link": "http://www.highlandmirror.com/", "articles": []}, "thefinancialanalyst": {"rss": "https://theanalystfinancial.com/feed/", "link": "https://theanalystfinancial.com/", "articles": []}, "reportagestuff": {"rss": "http://reportagestuff.com/feed/", "link": "http://reportagestuff.com/", "articles": []}, "tokenfolks": {"rss": "https://tokenfolks.com/feed/", "link": "https://tokenfolks.com/", "articles": []}, "heraldanalyst": {"rss": "https://heraldanalyst.com/feed/", "link": "https://heraldanalyst.com/", "articles": []}, "findmarketresearch": {"rss": "https://heraldanalyst.com/feed/", "link": "https://www.findmarketresearch.org/", "articles": []}}}
