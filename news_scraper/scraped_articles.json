And there are 73 cases that the Department of Health, Dr. Zucker, is now studying. But the illness has taken the lives of three young New Yorkers. So this is new, and it\u2019s developing. The Department of Health has communicated with the federal officials, the C.D.C. And the C.D.C. has asked New York to develop national criteria for this so that other states, other hospital systems can also be checking into this and looking into this. Again, as it turns out, these children happen to have the Covid antibodies or be positive for Covid. But those were not the symptoms they showed when they came in to the hospital system. This is the last thing that we need at this time, with all that\u2019s going on, with all the anxiety we have, now for parents to have to worry about whether or not their youngster was infected.

A lot of times, songwriting sessions are hard because you\u2019re on like a blind date, basically.

Which is so important in a room, by the way for producers, because we\u2019re all insecure, trying to make ideas in front of you guys.\u201d \u201cAnd we all were kind of laughing and like, this is crazy. What are we doing?\u201d \u201cIn my mind, her with her deep voice, that kind of, almost Depeche Mode-y, but like a pop version of it, like midnight driving in a Corvette.\u201d \u201cSo Jason\u2019s sitting at his synth, whipping up the track, and what are you guys doing?\u201d \u201cMe, Sarah and Coffee, we just, we\u2019re writing. It really is like a puzzle. You\u2019re constantly putting little bits together, and you work as a team.\u201d \u201cSomeone says a word that leads to a line, that leads to a melody.\u201d \u201cAnything we throw out, I write it down, and I write it in all caps.\u201d Singing: \u201cCommon love isn\u2019t for us.\u201d \u201cI need it to scream at me because if it screams at me and I don\u2019t like it, then maybe we change it.\u201d Singing: \u201cWe created something phenomenal, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d \u201cAsking a question to the audience also feels a little bit nostalgic.\u201d \u201cDua gets right into the booth, man.

Honestly, we were just being so ridiculous in the studio, so I just kind of went on in the room mic, and was like, what if I just do this?\u201d Singing: \u201cWho needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?\u201d \u201cIt allows everything to sort of drop out before it hits again, right?\u201d \u201cYeah. It\u2019s the \u2018suction\u2019 effect. You pull it back, and then you release it.\u201d Singing: \u201cAll night, I riot with you, I know you got my back, and you know I got you.\u201d \u201cThe verses are like this moody vibe, and then it blasts into this anthemic chant.\u201d Singing: \u201cLet\u2019s get physical.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re at a rally.\u201d \u201cRemember \u2018Care Bears\u2019?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cTo me, that\u2019s what the chorus is. It is a Care Bear shooting out a beam of light into the world.\u201d \u201cDua came up with that bridge melody, just messing around. So the fact that the song can even go from the big chorus to the next level is pretty wild.\u201d Singing: \u201cLet\u2019s get physical. Hold on just a little tighter, come on. Hold on.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a roast to sing. It\u2019s the climax of the song, but you have to do that twice through after verse-bridge-chorus, verse-bridge-chorus, double-middle-eight, back into a double chorus. It\u2019s a roast. It\u2019s so hard.\u201d Singing: \u201cTell me if you\u2019re ready, come on. Baby, keep on dancing.\u201d \u201cYeah, really, just like \u2018Aaaah!\u2019 I just see \u2018Flashdance,\u2019 like \u2018Maniac.\u2019 It\u2019s just so feel-good.\u201d Singing: \u201cLet\u2019s get physical.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know how anybody else would react to it. So when I sent it to my manager, I was like, oh, it\u2019s a bit over the top, but I bloody love it.\u201d \u201cThe flute almost didn\u2019t make it. I had to fight for this flute. I think Koz might have saved the day.\u201d \u201cThere was a lot of debate on the flute. The original demo of the flute was blazing off the top. You press play, and then it\u2019s just \u2014 this really loud flute. So my solution was to just filter it down. No one ever really said anything after that, so I assumed that it was OK. It\u2019s all about the flute to me. It\u2019s about the flute, and that drive. You just never want to lose that energy of when they made it because sometimes that\u2019s so hard to recreate.\u201d \u201cDua Lipa, ooh!\u201d \u201cAh, this chorus!\u201d \u201cSo impressed!\u201d \u201cCome on.

His message then was a salute to the men and women at home and abroad, who had sacrificed so much in pursuit of what he rightly called a great deliverance. The war had been a total war. It had affected everyone, and no one was immune from its impact. Whether it be the men and women called up to serve, families separated from each other or people asked to take up new roles and skills to support the war effort, all had a part to play. At the start, the outlook seemed bleak; the end, distant; the outcome, uncertain, but we kept faith that the cause was right. And this belief, as my father noted in his broadcast, carried us through. Never give up, never despair, that was the message of V-E Day. I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. The sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country. It was profound \u2014 though while we celebrated the victory in Europe, we knew there would be further sacrifice. It was not until August that fighting in the Far East ceased, and the war finally ended. Many people laid down their lives in that terrible conflict \u2014 they fought so we could live in peace, at home and abroad. They died so we could live as free people in a world of free nations. They risked all so our families and neighborhoods could be safe. We should and will remember them. As I now reflect on my father\u2019s words, and the joyous celebrations which some of us experienced firsthand, I\u2019m thankful for the strength and courage that the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and all our allies displayed. The wartime generation knew that the best way to honor those who did not come back from the war was to ensure that it didn\u2019t happen again. The greatest tribute to their sacrifice is that countries who were once sworn enemies are now friends, working side by side for the peace, health and prosperity of us all. Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish, instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps \u2014 but our streets are not empty. They are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other. And when I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognize and admire.

But it can\u2019t predict if those antibodies will make them immune. What this and other reliable antibody tests can do is give us a better picture of how widespread coronavirus actually is. And they\u2019re helping researchers design possible treatments and vaccines. \u201cMore widespread testing will help us to better understand more quickly what are the important variables, you know, who\u2019s going to be protected, who\u2019s not.\u201d These are samples from the people we just met including, Heidi and Jamshid. Here, they\u2019ll be spun to separate blood cells from plasma. Next, that plasma is taken to a different lab on campus for analysis. \u201cYou can see the robot is precisely putting in the right amount of each sample into the wells of the plate.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s been great demand for the test. The lab is basically open 24 hours. The instruments have been running day and night.\u201d Dr. Scott Boyd and his team developed this test, and now they\u2019re ramping up quickly. They\u2019ve just received a new shipment of robots called ELISA Instruments. Soon, the team hopes to process at least 4,000 samples a day. They use controls to validate their tests, so they know it works. The positive controls are from coronavirus patients at Stanford, and the negative are from healthy blood donors, taken before coronavirus jumped to humans. Out of 200 people, the results for a few may be inaccurate. But this kind of test is among the best we have. You can see the controls here in the left column of each assay plate. Once the plate finishes processing, you can see a yellow color in the patient samples that have antibodies. The darker the color, the more antibodies there are. \u201cBut just measuring the total quantity doesn\u2019t tell you all the information you\u2019d like to know. The question is, does somebody likely have immunity. The answers are not yet as clear.\u201d Only some antibodies actually fight or neutralize the virus. So the next step for researchers is to identify those ones. Then, how much of those neutralizing antibodies are needed to block the virus and prevent re infection? \u201cSo we\u2019re also now working on developing a neutralizing anybody test that would allow us to test a lot of patients in the hospital, and also health care workers.\u201d That neutralizing antibody test, which Dr. Boyd hopes to have ready by the end of May, will give a better sense of who is actually immune. Remember Heidi from earlier? Well, we watched her sample go through the process. \u201cCoronavirus.\u201d And now her results are in. \u201cNot detected.\u201d All right, so what did the results say? \u201cNegative. Negative COVID and negative serology, unfortunately. But it\u2019s a good thing, right? It can still be good. Today\u2019s really my only safe day, because I go back to work tomorrow. So I feel pretty safe that I can go over, see my mom without a mask. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s got the ability to survive a disease like this, so I\u2019ve had to be very careful. I haven\u2019t seen her face. She hasn\u2019t seen my face without a mask on since like, the beginning of March. I\u2019m negative.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cYay!\u201d \u201cYou get to take your mask off, at least for today. Come out here.\u201d \u201cOh my goodness. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d \u201cI missed you.\u201d \u201cI missed you. Oh, I haven\u2019t had a hug forever. Oh, I\u2019m so happy. O.K. Bye bye, sweetheart. Bye bye.\u201d \u201cAll right. Bye bye.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d Jamshid\u2019s results are the same as Heidi\u2019s \u201cSo I do not have the antibodies, which is great, because it means PPE works, which is fantastic. I\u2019ve definitely been in multiple rooms with people with known COVID, and I\u2019ve been wearing PPE. And I\u2019m glad that I was at a place that I didn\u2019t have to reuse or recycle my PPE.\u201d Preliminary data is starting to show that Heidi and Jamshid\u2019s negative antibody results are representative. \u201cHi, Romey.\u201d In places like the Bay Area that haven\u2019t been hard hit, only a small fraction of people are testing positive for antibodies. \u201cYou know, where I go to the grocery store, I get it. I go to work again, I get it. It\u2019s out there, so I\u2019m still going to take the same precautions. I\u2019m going to still wear a mask.\u201d But these tests are a first step towards understanding immunity.

But it can\u2019t predict if those antibodies will make them immune. What this and other reliable antibody tests can do is give us a better picture of how widespread coronavirus actually is. And they\u2019re helping researchers design possible treatments and vaccines. \u201cMore widespread testing will help us to better understand more quickly what are the important variables, you know, who\u2019s going to be protected, who\u2019s not.\u201d These are samples from the people we just met including, Heidi and Jamshid. Here, they\u2019ll be spun to separate blood cells from plasma. Next, that plasma is taken to a different lab on campus for analysis. \u201cYou can see the robot is precisely putting in the right amount of each sample into the wells of the plate.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s been great demand for the test. The lab is basically open 24 hours. The instruments have been running day and night.\u201d Dr. Scott Boyd and his team developed this test, and now they\u2019re ramping up quickly. They\u2019ve just received a new shipment of robots called ELISA Instruments. Soon, the team hopes to process at least 4,000 samples a day. They use controls to validate their tests, so they know it works. The positive controls are from coronavirus patients at Stanford, and the negative are from healthy blood donors, taken before coronavirus jumped to humans. Out of 200 people, the results for a few may be inaccurate. But this kind of test is among the best we have. You can see the controls here in the left column of each assay plate. Once the plate finishes processing, you can see a yellow color in the patient samples that have antibodies. The darker the color, the more antibodies there are. \u201cBut just measuring the total quantity doesn\u2019t tell you all the information you\u2019d like to know. The question is, does somebody likely have immunity. The answers are not yet as clear.\u201d Only some antibodies actually fight or neutralize the virus. So the next step for researchers is to identify those ones. Then, how much of those neutralizing antibodies are needed to block the virus and prevent re infection? \u201cSo we\u2019re also now working on developing a neutralizing anybody test that would allow us to test a lot of patients in the hospital, and also health care workers.\u201d That neutralizing antibody test, which Dr. Boyd hopes to have ready by the end of May, will give a better sense of who is actually immune. Remember Heidi from earlier? Well, we watched her sample go through the process. \u201cCoronavirus.\u201d And now her results are in. \u201cNot detected.\u201d All right, so what did the results say? \u201cNegative. Negative COVID and negative serology, unfortunately. But it\u2019s a good thing, right? It can still be good. Today\u2019s really my only safe day, because I go back to work tomorrow. So I feel pretty safe that I can go over, see my mom without a mask. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s got the ability to survive a disease like this, so I\u2019ve had to be very careful. I haven\u2019t seen her face. She hasn\u2019t seen my face without a mask on since like, the beginning of March. I\u2019m negative.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cYay!\u201d \u201cYou get to take your mask off, at least for today. Come out here.\u201d \u201cOh my goodness. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d \u201cI missed you.\u201d \u201cI missed you. Oh, I haven\u2019t had a hug forever. Oh, I\u2019m so happy. O.K. Bye bye, sweetheart. Bye bye.\u201d \u201cAll right. Bye bye.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d Jamshid\u2019s results are the same as Heidi\u2019s \u201cSo I do not have the antibodies, which is great, because it means PPE works, which is fantastic. I\u2019ve definitely been in multiple rooms with people with known COVID, and I\u2019ve been wearing PPE. And I\u2019m glad that I was at a place that I didn\u2019t have to reuse or recycle my PPE.\u201d Preliminary data is starting to show that Heidi and Jamshid\u2019s negative antibody results are representative. \u201cHi, Romey.\u201d In places like the Bay Area that haven\u2019t been hard hit, only a small fraction of people are testing positive for antibodies. \u201cYou know, where I go to the grocery store, I get it. I go to work again, I get it. It\u2019s out there, so I\u2019m still going to take the same precautions. I\u2019m going to still wear a mask.\u201d But these tests are a first step towards understanding immunity. Just having antibodies is not a free pass. \u201cHopefully if someone\u2019s positive, it doesn\u2019t give a false sense of security. I still think that everybody needs to protect themselves just the way that we currently are.\u201d", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/new-york-city-coronavirus-outbreak.html", "published": "2020-05-07T19:23:21", "title": "Travel From New York City Seeded Wave of U.S. Outbreaks", "text": "Research showed that by March 1, when the first coronavirus case was confirmed in New York, the city probably had over 10,000 undetected infections.\n\nCredit...

Nice to meet you. My contractions are about 15 minutes apart. And I\u2019m about to get pulled into an O.R. at Cornell to have a C-section. Like any minute now, they\u2019re going to come pull me through that door. And I\u2019m gloved-up and masked-up. And my husband\u2019s all suited-up. He\u2019s literally in a hazmat suit.\u201d Doctor: \u201cDad, do you want to grab those shoes and throw them?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re pulling me in. I have to go. Thank you. My name is Poonam Sharma Mathis. My husband is Kris Mathis. We have a 4\u00bd-year-old, Pierce Mathis.\u201d \u201cI need some Monday motivation, Pierce.\u201d \u201cMy first birth was pretty uneventful. The baby came out, we made eye contact and then I closed my eyes, and I woke up in the recovery room. Everybody was kissing him and hugging him. And I felt like the community and the village that he\u2019s so blessed to be a part of was there. I grew up with a lot of extended family and a lot of love. We\u2019d been wanting a girl in this generation so badly. So when we found out we were having a girl, we were just grateful. I was 37 weeks pregnant when they started to issue stay-at-home orders. OK, so I am officially scared. I\u2019m having contractions this morning. I am not a hypochondriac. I\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s really prone to general mass hysteria. But we are \u2014 I\u2019m breathless. We are dealing with something we don\u2019t understand.\u201d Kris: \u201cOnly a couple of days prior to our birth, they had been saying no partners, no spouses. I was probably one of the first spouses that was allowed into the hospital. I was walking, and it was like, do not touch anything. Make sure your mask is on. Put the booties over your shoes.\u201d \u201cMy husband could catch it right now. Right? He could bring it home, and give it to my son who\u2019s 4 and a half. And there\u2019s a thought about going home with my daughter, and then just immediately quarantining myself and my daughter.\u201d Doctor: \u201cAll right, Mom, are you ready?\u201d \u201cDo you want to open your eyes for me? No? Her name is Asha: 7 pounds, 11 ounces. They put her skin on my chest. But I had a mask on, so I wasn\u2019t breathing on her. Daddy is cuddling with her.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s weird. She opened her eyes right when she was born \u2014 really wide. And then I haven\u2019t seen her eyes since. She didn\u2019t like what she saw or something. Our expectations were that I probably wasn\u2019t going to be there anyway. So just being there for the delivery and seeing the baby, meeting the baby, it was a really exciting thing for me.\u201d \u201cYou realize you have to do a father-daughter dance, and give her away one day?\u201d \u201cBut then immediately after the birth, I had to say goodbye.\u201d \u201cSay, good night.\u201d \u201cSweet dreams.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s 11:30 at night. I\u2019m in my room. I just breastfed. [Asha crying] I wore a mask, and I threw up. The only good news is they let her stay in my room because babies are not being kept in the nursery right now. They\u2019re being kept with the mom. The next step is that we are waiting for news of my coronavirus status. Based on that result, they\u2019ll decide how much interaction I\u2019ll be having with her, for her own safety. So now we wait. I just want to kiss her. It was really exciting to find out that we tested negative, because that meant I could kiss her head. But it\u2019s definitely different delivering and recovering in a hospital during coronavirus, and it hit me yesterday. Yesterday was the worst day of physical pain in my life. I genuinely thought I might die. This is one of the most intense surgeries you can have, is a C-section. But if you have any air bubbles that go into your stomach when they cut you open, which is normal, those air bubbles don\u2019t come out right away. Then they float around your body, I guess, and they feel like knives stabbing you from the inside until they come out. And they don\u2019t want to come out. It is so traumatic being here without somebody to advocate for you when things go wrong, because there\u2019s too much going on. They are overwhelmed. I\u2019m pushing the call button to get care, and they don\u2019t come right away. And last time I gave birth here, four and a half years ago, they did everything right away because they were able to. I was in so much pain for so long, and waiting for my medication for so long, that I was throwing up. I threw up eight times from pain. It feels like I was in a horror movie where they chopped somebody up, but then the person escapes and is running to safety. And that\u2019s a ridiculous thing to say. We have the best health care. We\u2019re in the best city. But that\u2019s how it feels. I just want to get her home as soon as possible. And hopefully then I\u2019m able to walk and stand, and do something to help my husband take care of these kids. Thursday at around 1:30, my husband and son came and picked us up. She was so excited to meet you she didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d \u201cAsha.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t left the upstairs from Thursday till now. It\u2019s Monday morning. There\u2019s so much family that\u2019s just waiting, itching to rush in and be with us. And who knows if that will happen before she\u2019s 3 months old.\u201d \u201cOne toe is kind of curving.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cWill she wrap her finger around your finger if you put it in there?\u201d Poonam: \u201cShe\u2019s like a little animal, huh?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to be such a good big brother.\u201d Poonam: \u201cMm-hmm. I\u2019m just grateful that she\u2019s healthy. I\u2019m grateful that so far, my husband and myself and my son are healthy. I look at her eyes, and I do believe that the eyes show something even from birth. Whenever she does open her eyes, she just looks and she\u2019s just laser-focused. And it\u2019s not a curious focus. It\u2019s like \u2014 like she knows she needs to be calm right now or something. I had a great aunt who always said that if she could come back, she\u2019d come back as my daughter. So maybe that\u2019s her, I hope.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 Nothing so well illustrates Wall Street\u2019s dangerously exuberant state of mind as its triple-digit rally in the wake of Larry Summers withdrawing from consideration to be the next Federal Reserve chairman.\n\nDo you really believe the outlook for corporate earnings suddenly became much brighter just because Summers is no longer in the running to succeed Ben Bernanke?\n\nIf so, I have a bridge I want to sell you.\n\nWall Street is now fully ensconced in that alternate reality in which all news is interpreted as a reason to rally. It\u2019s nice while it lasts, but it probably won\u2019t end well.\n\nIn fact, according to contrarian analysis, this sentiment situation is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the wall of worry that bull markets like to climb. It\u2019s more akin to the slope of hope that bear markets like to descend.\n\nConsider the bullishness that now prevails among the short-term market timing newsletters tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest. Their average recommended equity exposure right now stands at 56.6%, according to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index (HSNSI). That\u2019s 45 percentage points higher than the exposure level that prevailed just 12 trading sessions ago, in late August.\n\nThat\u2019s an awfully quick jump back on the bullish bandwagon by the typical market timer. In fact, the HSNSI is now higher than where it stood at the market\u2019s all-time high in early August \u2014 right before the stock market\u2019s August pullback (see chart).\n\nThis is a textbook illustration of what happens when Wall Street adopts a \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d attitude.\n\nFormer Lehman employees rock out\n\nIf the market really thought it would be so awful if Larry Summers were Fed chairman, then it should have fallen as it looked increasingly likely that he would be appointed. That would have especially been true this past Friday, following a report from Japan\u2019s Nikkei newspaper that President Obama had decided to appoint Summers.\n\nFar from falling, however, the market rose on Friday \u2014 both at the open, right after that story appeared on the wires, and for the rest of the day as well.\n\nIndeed, Friday\u2019s action led some analysts to complain Friday that the market had yet to price in what they referred to as the \u201cSummers put.\u201d Never mind, though, logic has nothing to do with this market: It still rallied on Monday as though it had priced in that put.\n\nThe same has been true recently for other potentially bad news, such as Syria. The market shrugs off the initial threat of that bad news, and yet its removal is taken as the occasion for rallying.\n\nThe contrarian-based worry about this sentiment situation is that the market is being held up more by a happy mood than by a solid assessment of the fundamentals. As a result, the market will fall all the more precipitously when investors\u2019 mood begins to sour \u2014 as it eventually will.\n\nAnd though investor psychology is difficult to analyze, we know investors are notoriously fickle. Will it be paralysis in Washington over the debt ceiling that causes them to become less exuberant? A worsening of the Syria mess? Most likely, it will be something that comes out of left field that isn\u2019t even on our radar right now.\n\nThe one thing we do know is that, when that souring does happen, the market\u2019s lofty level will not be receiving much support from the fundamentals.\n\nBuyer beware.\n\nClick here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/ayrWz1FSrQE/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-12T18:28:34", "title": "Picking a perfect dividend portfolio", "text": "CHAPEL HILL. N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 When it comes to dividends, more isn\u2019t always better: A company isn\u2019t necessarily more attractive just because it pays a higher dividend.\n\nThat is the clear lesson I draw from the dividend-oriented newsletter with the best long-term record among the 200 services in the Hulbert Financial Digest rankings: Investment Quality Trends, edited by Kelley Wright. \u201cHigher\u201d or \u201clower\u201d for him only have meaning when comparing a company\u2019s current dividend with what it paid in the past. He believes that comparisons with other companies are unhelpful.\n\nConsider CVS Caremark Corp. CVS, +2.71% , the drug retailer, and HCP Inc. US:HCP , the health-care real-estate investment trust. Wright rates CVS Caremark more highly than HCP, even though CVS\u2019s dividend yield \u2014 the annual dividend as a percentage of the stock price \u2014 is just 1.6%, while HCP has a 4.1% yield.\n\nWright believes CVS is the better bet because its current yield is at the high end of the range of its past yields, which have extended from a low of 0.4% to its current 1.6%. HCP\u2019s current yield, by contrast, is at the low end of its historical range, which has gotten as high as 12.4%. So, in terms of relative dividend yield, CVS\u2019s is higher than HCP\u2019s.\n\nHidden gems from the '70s\n\nOver the years, Wright has found that high yields come back down to earth and low yields rise back toward the midpoint of their historical range. That would be bad news for HCP, since a likely cause of its yield rising would be a falling stock price \u2014 which could lead to losses that more than eliminate the benefit of the high yield.\n\nFor CVS, by contrast, Wright believes the path of least resistance is for its yield to decline because its stock price rises.\n\nTo be sure, CVS\u2019s yield also would come down if the company cuts its dividend, which would be bad for its stock price. Wright therefore focuses his analysis only on companies with strong balance sheets and a long and consistent pattern of higher earnings and increasing dividends.\n\nThink before you grab those Ivy hunks\n\nSo how has Wright\u2019s strategy performed over time? According to the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s calculations, Investment Quality Trends over the past three decades has beaten the dividend-adjusted return of the entire U.S. stock market by an average of 1.2 percentage points a year \u2014 while nevertheless incurring less risk.\n\nThat is a winning combination: The service is in second place for risk-adjusted performance among the three dozen advisers for which track records extend back that far.\n\nWright\u2019s strategy is to be distinguished from the traditional approach to picking dividend stocks, which focuses on absolute rather than relative yield.\n\nOne popular variant of the traditional approach is the so-called Dogs of the Dow strategy, in which investors buy the 10 stocks among the 30 Dow Industrials DJIA, +1.90% with the highest yields. For example, the three Dow \u201cdogs\u201d that currently have the highest yields are two telecommunication companies, AT&T T, +3.11% (4.7%) and Verizon Communications VZ, +2.55% (4.1%), and tech giant Intel INTC, +0.84% (4.1%).\n\nDespite investing in stocks with yields this high, however, the strategy has disappointed recently. Over the past five years (through March 31), it has produced a 5.0% annualized return, lagging the 5.9% dividend-adjusted return of the S&P 500 SPX, +1.68% and barely half the 10.8% return of a portfolio that is periodically updated to always contain just the 10 stocks that Wright recommends most highly.\n\nAnother variant of the traditional focus on absolute yield can be found in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index. It contains the 50 highest-yielding stocks among the S&P 1500 Composite index that also have a long history of dividend increases.\n\nThe index\u2019s two largest components currently are Pitney Bowes (the mail and document-services company, with a 10.0% yield) and biotech company AbbVie (yielding 3.7%).\n\nThough the performance of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats index in recent years has been better than that of the Dogs of the Dow strategy, it still lags behind that of Investment Quality Trends. Over the past five years, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, +3.27% , which is benchmarked to the index, has produced an annual dividend-adjusted return of 9.2% through March 31 \u2014 nearly two percentage points a year lower than the portfolio of Wright\u2019s 10 most attractive dividend stocks.\n\nNote carefully that this Wright portfolio currently holds none of the stocks that are at the top of the holdings list for either the Dogs of the Dow or the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. In addition to CVS Caremark, the following nine stocks are in Wright\u2019s portfolio: Air Products & Chemicals APD, +2.94% (yielding 3.3%), Archer Daniels Midland ADM, +4.68% (2.3%), Coca-Cola KO, +3.38% (2.7%), ConocoPhillips COP, +2.57% (4.4%), Occidental Petroleum OXY, +8.21% (3.2%), PepsiCo PEP, +2.03% (2.7%), Reliance Steel & Aluminum RS, +4.52% (1.7%), Texas Instruments TXN, +1.18% (3.1%) and Walgreen US:WAG (2.3%).\n\nThe average yield of all 10 stocks is 2.7%, versus 2.0% for the S&P 500 as a whole. And, even better, if Wright is right: These 10 have the potential to outperform the S&P 500 on a price-appreciation basis as well.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/nPEYyo38O6s/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-01T10:01:19", "title": "Car companies stuck in slow lane", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

The two auto makers that garner any buy recommendations from the top performers don\u2019t come anywhere close to that kind of popularity: Currently there are 75 other stocks in addition to Pfizer that those top performers like more.\n\nNote carefully, furthermore, that there are no other auto makers besides these four that the top performers like any better.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 The most cited bullish argument these days, at least among the couple of hundred investment advisers I monitor, is that the stock market will \u201cmelt up\u201d as investors sour on bonds and transfer the trillions they have in fixed-income mutual funds into stock funds.\n\nI suppose it is conceivable. But a careful review of historical fund patterns doesn\u2019t provide much support for this so-called Great Rotation argument.\n\nConsider the share of all mutual-fund assets (excluding money-market funds) that are allocated to either stocks or bonds. According to data provided by the Investment Company Institute in Washington, the equity share at the end of 2012 stood at 65.7%. That is only marginally lower than the 71% average of all comparable monthly readings since 1970.\n\nGiven that pattern, it is difficult to make the case that average fund investors are allocating an abnormally low share of their assets to stocks \u2014 or that they are about to increase that share.\n\nOther mutual-fund data cast doubt on the Great Rotation as well.\n\nPaper or plastic? Dollar bills, that is!\n\nConsider 1987, arguably the period over the past three decades most relevant to the Great Rotation argument today. Then, as now, a bull market was getting long in the tooth. Beginning in April of that year, following more than 60 months in which fund investors had invested an average of nearly $4 billion a month of new money in bonds, they reversed course in a big way. Over the next six months, according to the ICI data, fund investors withdrew an average of $3 billion a month from bond funds.\n\nAs market historians recall, the stock market that year topped out in August, four months after that trend reversal. And the 1987 crash \u2014 the worst one-day drop in U.S. stock-market history \u2014 occurred two months after that. Far from inaugurating a new bull market for stocks, that reversal in fund investors\u2019 opinion about bonds came right before a major stock-market top.\n\nAnother reason to question the Great Rotation argument is that any positive impact on the stock market is likely to be short-term at best. That, at least, is the finding of a study, \u201cMeasuring Investment Sentiment with Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d published last May in the Journal of Financial Economics.\n\nThe authors found that even though the stock market often rises as investors shift assets from bond funds to stock funds, almost all of that increase is reversed within four months\u2019 time.\n\nThe Great Rotation stock-market melt-up hypothesis also would have to fly in the face of well-documented seasonal trading patterns. A study presented in December at the Australasian Finance & Banking Conference in Sydney, \u201cSeasonal Asset Allocation: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d found that U.S. fund investors on average transfer assets from stock to bond funds during the winter months \u2014 and do just the reverse in summer.\n\nAs followers of the famous \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d seasonal pattern will recognize, the implication of this new research is that the stock market on balance has performed better when the direction of fund flows between stocks and bonds is in precisely the opposite direction of what\u2019s presumed by the Great Rotation argument.\n\nEven if a Great Rotation out of bonds comes to pass, it doesn\u2019t mean investors will move all of that money into stocks.\n\nIn fact, they probably would put much of it in boring old money-market funds, according to Claude Erb, a former fixed-income fund manager at Trust Co. of the West.\n\nInvestors are reluctant to transfer funds between one asset class and another, Erb says. Since they typically consider money-market funds to be in the fixed-income asset class, money funds most likely would be the primary beneficiary of bond-fund redemptions, he says \u2014 especially since the higher interest rates that make bond funds less attractive would make money funds more so.\n\nIf these patterns are any guide to the future, now might be the time to pull back from stocks rather than dive in. As Russ Wermers, a University of Maryland finance professor and one of the authors of the research presented at the December conference, puts it: \u201cFor most investors, the more proper response to the fund flow premise of the Great Rotation argument is probably to reduce equity exposure rather than allocate new sums to equities.\u201d", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/3FYsOI8GjSk/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-06T12:30:38", "title": "Insiders now aggressively bearish", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 Corporate insiders are aggressively selling their shares.\n\nThis is worrisome because corporate insiders \u2014 officers, directors and the largest shareholders \u2014 presumably know more about their companies\u2019 prospects than the rest of us do. If they were confident that the shares of their companies would soon be trading markedly higher, they wouldn\u2019t be selling them now.\n\nYet selling they are \u2014 at an alarming pace.\n\nConsider an insider indicator calculated by the Vickers Weekly Insider Report, published by Argus Research. The indicator is a ratio of all shares that insiders have recently sold in the open market to the number that they have purchased.\n\nFor the week that ended last Friday, this sell-to-buy ratio for NYSE-listed shares listed stood at 9.20-to-1. That means insiders of these companies, on average, were selling more than nine shares of their firms\u2019 stock for every one that they were buying.\n\nMutual funds take big bite of Apple\n\nThe last time a weekly sell-to-buy ratio was worse than this was in late July 2011, right before that year\u2019s debt-ceiling debate began to spiral out of control. Over the next couple of weeks, of course, as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s credit rating was downgraded, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.90% lost some 2,000 points.\n\nTo be sure, insiders have been selling heavily for several weeks now, and the market has continued to rise \u2014 including the Dow\u2019s eclipsing of the 14,000 level in recent sessions. This surprising strength in the face of insider selling has prompted a number of you to inquire how unusual it is for the insiders collectively to be such poor market timers.\n\nAs you can imagine, it\u2019s not unprecedented. But it is more the exception than the rule.\n\nConsider where the sell-to-buy ratio was in mid-December, which is the last time I devoted a column to the insiders\u2019 behavior. For NYSE-listed stocks, the ratio at that time stood at 8.38-to-1. Read Dec. 18 Mark Hulbert column on insider selling.\n\nUpon reviewing the historical data, shared with me by Argus Research, I found four occasions over the last decade in which the ratio got this high or higher and the market continued rising for at least another month or two.\n\nOverall, however, the market fell. On average over the month following each prior occasion when the sell-to-buy ratio got this high, the broad market fell by 2.1% \u2014 as measured by the Wilshire 5000 total-return index.\n\nIn any case, as others among you have pointed out, the high level of insider selling in December could very well have been caused in large part by the prospect of higher tax rates in 2013 \u2014 which would have prompted them to accelerate their sales. To the extent this was so, of course, the high sell-to-buy ratio at that time would have been a false signal.\n\nRegardless, the sell-to-buy ratio today is even higher than it was in mid-December, and it can\u2019t be discounted because of the immediate prospect of higher taxes.\n\nAll of which suggests to me that there is a distinct possibility that this time around, unlike in December, the insiders will be right.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/wPEX3LaXAsc/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-05T12:01:27", "title": "How to pick dividend-paying stocks", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 So you\u2019ve finally decided to heed the oft-repeated advice to invest in dividend-paying stocks.\n\nNow what?\n\nIt turns out that you still have an overwhelmingly large number of stocks to choose among. In 2012, for example, more than 400 of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.68% paid dividends \u2014 or more than 80% of them.\n\nTelling me to confine myself to just the dividend-payers, therefore, doesn\u2019t narrow my buy list down to a helpful number.\n\nThe best way of going about constructing a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks, based on the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s monitoring of more than 500 separate strategies, is to follow the methodology employed by Investment Quality Trends.\n\nWhy Dow may hit 15,000 in 2013\n\nThis service, inaugurated by Geraldine Weiss more than four decades ago and currently edited by Kelley Wright, doesn\u2019t simply recommend the dividend stocks with the highest yield. The service instead focuses more narrowly on the bluest of the blue-chip dividend-paying stocks, and recommends one of them only when its yield is near the high end of its historical range.\n\nThe service\u2019s restriction to just the bluest of blue-chip companies is designed to avoid companies at which the dividend yield is only temporarily high \u2014 firms that are about to cut their dividends, in other words.\n\nSpecifically, Wright puts a stock on his watch list only if it satisfies at least five of the following six criteria:\n\nHas increased its dividend at least 5 times over the last dozen years\n\nHas an S&P Quality Ranking in the \u201cA\u201d category\n\nHas at least 5 million shares outstanding\n\nHas at least 80 institutional investors\n\nHas paid dividends for at least 25 straight years\n\nHas produced higher earnings per share in at least 7 of the last 12 years\n\nThe service\u2019s focus on relative dividend yield is a recognition that each company has a different baseline. A utility company, for example, may still pay a much higher dividend yield than other companies, even when that yield is lower than its baseline \u2014 and when, therefore, it more likely than not is overvalued.\n\nHow has this approach performed? Over the last 12 months, for example, it has outperformed all of the major dividend-oriented ETFs. The average portfolio from Investment Quality Trends has gained 16.9% over this period, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest.\n\nBetter yet, this superior return was produced with nearly 20% less volatility, or risk \u2014 which means its performance on a risk-adjusted basis is even better than the raw numbers already suggest.\n\nIts record over the longer term has also been impressive. Over the 25 years the Hulbert Financial Digest has tracked it, it has beaten a buy-and-hold by one percentage point per year on an annualized basis, while nevertheless incurring 14% less risk.\n\nInvestment Quality Trends currently is in third place for risk-adjusted performance over the last 25 years.\n\nWhich high-quality stocks are currently recommended by this approach? The following is Wright\u2019s \u201cTimely Ten\u201d list of his top 10 current recommendations:\n\nThis package of 10 stocks not only has an average dividend yield of 2.6% but, Wright is convinced, has good capital-appreciation potential in the event of a continuation of the bull market, and healthy downside protection in the event of a bear market.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/stWPJLBZcDU/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-01T12:01:39", "title": "The 5 biggest investor mistakes of 2013", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

If I had assumed a higher return number, then the outcome of my analysis would have been an even lower fair value today.\n\nArmed with these three otherwise generous inputs, calculating a fair price for Facebook was a matter of simple math: As I reported last May, that price was $13.80. Read previous column: Facebook\u2019s stock should trade for $13.80.\n\nHow can Facebook overcome this awful fate? Since investors won\u2019t be happy earning less than 11% per year, and since it\u2019s unreasonable to expect the company\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2017 to be markedly higher than Google\u2019s is today, the only realistic way for Facebook to overcome my dismal price target is for its revenue growth rate to be far higher than 25.6% per year through 2016.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Getty Images\n\nYet the company has not shown that it can maintain this much higher revenue growth rate.\n\nTo be sure, it might on the surface seem otherwise. The company\u2019s revenues for calendar 2012 were 37% higher than in 2011.\n\nBut, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who is one of academia\u2019s leading experts on IPOs, the typical pattern is for a post-IPO company\u2019s revenue growth rate to decline over its first several years after going public.\n\nTo average 25.6% over its first five years after coming to market, therefore, a company\u2019s revenue growth in its first couple of years needs to be above that rate.\n\nConsider, for instance, the average revenue growth rate over the first three years after a company comes to market. According to Ritter, this three-year growth rate was 36.7% per year for the same sample of IPOs that produced a five-year annualized growth rate of 25.6%.\n\nSo Facebook\u2019s revenue growth over this past year is almost precisely in line with the rate that was the basis of my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nHow, then, is Wall Street able to persuade itself that Facebook should be trading at its currently high price? As far as I can tell, by assuming Facebook deserves to have a sky-high price-to-sales ratio \u2014 not just now, but also well into the future.\n\nConsider, according to FactSet, the consensus estimate of Facebook\u2019s revenues in calendar 2015 \u2014 the furthest year out for which a consensus estimate is provided. That consensus is $10.5 billion\u2014not that far off of what was implied by my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nAssuming that consensus is on target, and assuming Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2015 will be the same as Google\u2019s is today, then Facebook\u2019s market cap at the end of 2015 would be around $52 billion. That\u2019s some 25% lower than where the company\u2019s market cap stands today.\n\nDon\u2019t like the conclusions of my calculations? Be my guest and go through the exercise yourself, employing any of the standard valuation metrics. And use your calculations to subject Facebook\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report to a smell test.\n\nMy hunch is that if you do so, you will not be running out to buy Facebook stock afterward.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/WztdRhRt8IM/story.asp", "published": "2013-01-25T16:27:45", "title": "Apple\u2019s drop shows price of popularity", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 What investment lesson are you drawing from Apple\u2019s breathtaking plunge over the last couple of months?\n\nThe one I think is most important is a contrarian one: To find your prince, you need to be willing to kiss a frog.\n\nFor years now, this contrarian lesson was dismissed by Apple AAPL, +2.38% investors, who racked up huge gains by ignoring contrarian analysis and instead investing in the most popular, coolest and best-performing company in sight. (Read blog post on the more than 5,000 mutual funds and ETFs that own Apple shares.)\n\nHowever, now that the stock is down nearly 40% since its peak of last September \u2014 including a more than 12% drop in Thursday\u2019s trading alone \u2014 perhaps they will be more open to considering the contrarian wisdom of investing in out-of-favor companies.\n\nThe stocks of such companies may be less exciting, but over the long term they usually provide a superior \u2014 and certainly less volatile \u2014 return.\n\nJust consider a spectacular bet that Robert Arnott, chairman and founder of Research Affiliates, made in the summer of 2010. To set the context of his bet, Apple that summer surpassed Microsoft MSFT, +0.58% to take the No. 2 spot in the market-cap rankings \u2014 and was fast closing in on ExxonMobil XOM, +4.38% as the largest publicly traded company in the world.\n\nAs contrarian investors know, sometimes you need to kiss a frog to find your prince. Reuters\n\nBP BP, +2.56% , in contrast, was on life support as it struggled to cope with the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Its stock price had plunged to its lowest in over a decade. Survival was by no means assured.\n\nLike the good contrarian he is, however, Arnott was willing to \u201ckiss the frog\u201d: He publicly bet that BP would outperform Apple over the longer term.\n\nThat was a gutsy bet indeed. If you don\u2019t believe me, take a look at the vitriolic comments my column received for merely reporting Arnott\u2019s bet. Read August 2010 column in Barron\u2019s by Mark Hulbert: Is Apple\u2019s market value too big for comfort?\n\nTo be sure, Arnott\u2019s bet only recently became a winner. But he is today enjoying the last laugh: Since BP\u2019s low in the summer of 2010, it has produced a cumulative real return of 77%, in contrast to 71% for Apple.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only time Arnott has kissed a frog. Another came a year after his BP-over-AAPL bet: In August 2011 he predicted that Bank of America BAC, +3.19% would outperform Apple over the long term.\n\nAt that time, it was hard to imagine Bank of America\u2019s reputation being more awful. It represented all that was dysfunctuional about bank and mortgage-company behavior that led to the credit crunch and liquidity crisis of 2008.\n\nEven today it is paying the price for its bad deeds: Its latest quarterly earnings, released last week, were hugely depressed by billions in charges related to the settlement of various legal disputes arising out of the subprime-mortgage fiasco. Read full report on BAC earnings.\n\nIs Apple a value investor's dream?\n\nYet on this BAC-over AAPL bet, Arnott is even further in the black than he is with his BP bet: Since my August 2011 column reporting it, Bank of America stock has produced an 18-month real return of 60%, versus 25% for Apple.\n\nTo be sure, contrarian bets like Arnott\u2019s don\u2019t always work out this nicely. But, more often than not, they do.\n\nWe know this because of the superior long-term performance of benchmarks like Arnott\u2019s so-called fundamental indices, which almost always end up underweighting the stocks with the largest market caps.\n\nConsider the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index, which weights stocks according to a number of fundamental criteria rather than market cap. In the summer of 2010, for example, when Arnott made his BP-over-AAPL bet, Apple was the 27th largest company in that index. It would have been the second-largest company in the index if its weight had been based on market cap.\n\nSince the inception of the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index in November 2005, its alternate weighting scheme has added 1.44 percentage points per year to its return. That\u2019s a lot of alpha to trace to changing each stock\u2019s weight in the index.\n\nKeep that in mind the next time you\u2019re tempted to invest in the latest fad on Wall Street.\n\nWhat frog might a contrarian be kissing right now?\n\nIn an email earlier this week, Chris Brightman, head of investment management at Research Affiliates, suggested betting on Wal-Mart WMT, +0.86% over Amazon AMZN, +0.50% . The latter company may not have the same pizzazz that Apple did in its heyday, but it still represents the allure and promise of the high-tech sector \u2014 especially in contrast to Wal-Mart.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock is up over 50% over the last year, triple Wal-Mart\u2019s stock gain of just 17%.\n\nBrightman\u2019s contrarian-based reasoning: \u201cToday, Amazon has a market capitalization of $124 billion, more than half of Wal-Mart\u2019s $233 billion market cap. Yet Wal-Mart is more than five times the size of Amazon measured by sales, cash flow, dividends, and book value. Wal-Mart has free cash flow ... of $11 billion per year to distribute to its shareholders \u2014 which is paid as $5 billion in dividends and $6 billion as share buybacks \u2014 providing a nearly 5% annual yield.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon [in contrast] has only $2 billion of free cash flow and pays nothing back to its shareholders. Amazon\u2019s sales and cash flow will need to more than quintuple relative to Wal-Mart to match Wal-Mart\u2019s ability to pay its shareholders. Anything less, and Wal-Mart is the better investment.\u201d\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}]}, "marketwatch_stories": {"rss": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/topstories/", "link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/newsviewer/", "articles": [{"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B25E55C66-8BF6-11EA-B500-29C0C34A0E28%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-05-10T10:07:10", "title": "Hedge fund blames U.S. meat processing \u2018oligopoly\u2019 for \u2018excessive concentration, reduced competition and\u2026a decline in resilience\u2019", "text": "A portfolio manager at one of world\u2019s leading hedge funds has launched an attack against America\u2019s big four meat processing firms for their alleged part in breaking the U.S. food supply chain.\n\nThe comments by Tim Bond, partner and portfolio manager at Odey Asset Management, were triggered by full-page newspaper advertisements taken out by meat processor Tyson Foods TSN, +5.46% at the end of last month. The ads warned \u201cthe food supply chain is breaking.\u201d\n\nBond told MarketWatch that John Tyson, the chairman of Tyson Foods, \u201conly has his own company to blame, along with the three other companies that constitute the oligopoly controlling 85% of U.S. meat processing,\u201d after industry consolidation meant there were fewer larger processing plants, which now find themselves struggling to cope with the impact of coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThe industry is a poster child for the trend towards excessive concentration, reduced competition and \u2014 as we are now discovering \u2014 a decline in resilience,\u201d said Bond.\n\nOdey Asset Management, which has over $3 billion funds under management, was established in 1991 by billionaire Crispin Odey. Odey Asset Management said it had no positions in Tyson Foods and has not shorted the stock. It said Bond has a history of championing competition.\n\nRead:Trump issues executive order for meat processing plants to remain open amid pandemic\n\nTyson Foods, has been a driving force transforming the industry from its fragmented past to fewer larger integrated processing facilities. But labor-intensive production lines have become hotbeds for the spread of coronavirus, and the resultant closure of such big facilities has threatened the supply of meat to people\u2019s homes.\n\nTyson, which posted a 15% fall in second quarter net income on Monday, compared with the previous year, has had to shut plants in Nebraska, Washington and Iowa.\n\nIn 1977, the four largest meat processing firms constituted just 25% of the market, claims Bond. Today, they control 85% of the slaughter market, as well as some 35% of cattle ranches and around 65% of the entire chicken industry, he said.\n\nSince 1990, the number of slaughter houses, excluding poultry, has declined by 46%, from 2,709 establishments to just 1,461 establishments.\n\nRead: Keeping slaughterhouses open to protect U.S. meat supply may boost these food-packaging companies\n\n\u201cAs a result, when a handful of these factories are forced to close due to coronavirus-related absences, farmers have nowhere to slaughter their animals and the industry grinds to halt,\u201d Bond said.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, the increase in industry concentration is highly correlated with an increase in beef and veal consumer prices relative to overall food inflation. So the oligopoly of this industry has simultaneously ripped off consumers and producers and is now incapable of feeding the nation.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Tyson Foods said: \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen the analyst report so we can\u2019t comment on it. The truth is this pandemic has affected businesses across our nation, in every sector of the economy, regardless of size, service, location, or ownership. It\u2019s also affected thousands of farmers and ranchers whose continued viability is extremely important to us.\n\n\u201cAs the world population continues to grow, so does demand for protein. That\u2019s why food companies with the resources and innovative capabilities like Tyson Foods are needed to help meet that growing demand.\u201d\n\nRead:Reduced dividends, softer growth and an economy haunted by zombie companies \u2014 that\u2019s the postpandemic future seen by this Odey fund manager\n\n\u201cGiven the symbolic importance of the beef steak in American culture, the weekend whine for more government financial aid will probably prove effective,\u201d Bond said. \u201cA sensible support package would include measures that ensure the breakup of this oligopoly, but one somehow doubts that they will be forthcoming.\u201d\n\nHowever, Steve Kay, owner of Cattlebuyer Weekly, and an authority on the read meat industry, said competition in the U.S. is healthy: \u201cIt\u2019s factually incorrect to say concentration has increased over the last 7 years. The data proves that. There is not only plenty of competition in the market there are sizable players.\u201d\n\nLast Tuesday, just two days after Tyson published its full page advertisements, President Donald Trump took executive action to order meat processing plants to stay open, amid concerns over growing coronavirus cases and the impact on America\u2019s food supply.\n\nTrump cited the Defense Production Act, classing the processing of meat as critical infrastructure.

It projects 100,773 deaths from COVID-19 by May 21.\n\nThat projection, which is one of key measures watched by the White House, could go as high as 243,000, taking into account the institute\u2019s margin of error. Christopher Murray, the director of the institute, cited \u201cpremature relaxation of social distancing\u201d as the primary reason for the increased projection.\n\nCoronavirus-related deaths could rise to 3,000 per day by June 1 from 2,000 deaths a day currently, according to preliminary data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, first reported by the New York Times on Monday. The data are based on a model developed by Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\n\n\u201cOur rough guess is that come June, at least 95% of the U.S. will still be susceptible,\u201d IHME\u2019s Murray told NPR. \u201cThat means, of course, it can come right back.

I have to furnish everything for both houses.\n\nI have a much lower income then my ex husband: about $20,000 versus $70,000.

But you ultimately have no control over what happens next, or your ex-husband\u2019s actions. That\u2019s why you divorced. After you take these actions, I implore you to move on.\n\nOption 1: Ask your ex for the $500.

So what happens now?\n\nOption 2: Claim your child-tax credits next year in the hope the IRS recognizes that this $500 is due to you, gives you that money in your 2020 tax refund, and deducts the same amount from your ex-husband\u2019s tax refund next year. However, whether or not you have bought furniture for your ex-husband\u2019s home, this $500 should not be given to you twice, by him and also by the IRS.\n\nIf your ex-husband does give you the $500, and the IRS effectively moves the $500 from his 2019 taxes to your 2020 taxes, you will have a decision to make. Again, it\u2019s an ethical one. Should you give the $500 to your ex, or should you keep it because of all the ways he has allegedly not acted appropriately or responsibly in the past? My suggestion: Give it back.\n\nDispatches from a pandemic:Letter from New York: \u2018New Yorkers wear colorful homemade masks, while nurses wear garbage bags\u2019\n\nThe CARES Act was written hastily to deal with a public-health emergency and economic crisis that are still unfolding.

She also noted, \"We have been working with them, looking at some of their safety plans, and have had some recommendations.\"\n\nTesla had wanted to start production again on Friday afternoon. The plant is where the company makes vehicles for Europe and North America. The company's headquarters are in Palo Alto, not part of Alameda County.\n\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla's employees are not part of a union, so it would be easier for the company to significantly alter its operations.\n\nInsulting Pan personally, Musk wrote on Twitter:\n\n\"Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected & ignorant 'Interim Health Officer' of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!\"\n\nHe also claimed that: \"Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.\"\n\nAlameda County responded with a statement saying its Health Care Services Agency and Public Health Department have been working closely with Tesla in Fremont on a safety plan. They said they aim for Tesla to reopen while protecting the health of thousands of employees who travel to and from work at the factory.\n\n\"We look forward to coming to an agreement on an appropriate safety plan very soon,\" the county said without offering specific details on a timeline. \"We appreciate that our residents and businesses have made tremendous sacrifices and that together we have been able to save lives and protect community health in our region. We need to continue to work together so those sacrifices don't go to waste and that we maintain our gains.\"\n\nWhile Musk characterized Pan as \"ignorant,\" the doctor has deep experience in both public health and infectious diseases.\n\nAmong other things, Pan is a graduate of Tufts medical school, completed a residency and fellowship at UCSF and has worked at Alameda County Public Health Department since 2011 while also working as a physician and professor.

Johannes Eisele | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has tested the patience of Amazon shoppers, as many of the perks they've come to expect from the website, such as free, two-day shipping and an endless library of affordable products, are no longer guaranteed. It's easy for consumers to point the finger at Amazon for out-of-stock notices, far-off delivery dates and higher prices. But Amazon and the sellers that supply the products on its site are not entirely to blame. Amazon has been combating coronavirus-related issues on multiple fronts for the past several months. It was hit with a surge of online orders in March as shoppers were panic buying essential items on its site. At the same time, Amazon was policing a widespread price gouging problem and its grocery delivery services were buckling under the weight of online orders. By mid-March, Amazon made the decision to prioritize shipments of household items and medical supplies at its warehouses, while vastly limiting who could sell goods like face masks and sanitizer, which left many sellers in the lurch. Last month, Amazon started allowing merchants to ship in some nonessential items, but it is still limiting the quantity of items in new shipments. The quantity restrictions signal that the logistics nightmare might not be over yet for Amazon or third-party sellers, who say the restrictions are preventing their businesses from recovering. Amazon and the third-party sellers that make up more than half of its sales agree: There were few ways anyone could prepare for the crisis and the supply shortages and delays that came along with it. \"They had no time to plan and that's the really scary part,\" said James Thomson, a seller consultant and former head of Amazon Services, the team that recruits third-party sellers to list on Amazon's marketplace. \"Amazon is great at forecasting when the data is predictable. Well, this was unpredictable.\"\n\n'No such preparation'\n\nAmazon's fulfillment and delivery operations are used to taking on millions of packages per day, but the coronavirus presented a unique set of challenges. The company continues to deal with delivery delays caused by bottlenecks in its logistics network. Shipping methods it would usually rely on have strained capacity, making it harder for Amazon to quickly transfer inventory from one fulfillment center to another. On top of this, Amazon's last-mile delivery partners struggled to handle the demand from the surge in online orders. For every wrinkle in the shipping process, time is tacked onto the delivery date, frustrating shoppers and merchants who are used to Amazon's traditionally speedy one- or two-day delivery promise. Amazon acknowledged on its most recent earnings call that it quickly became overwhelmed by the demand for essential items at the height of the crisis. \"While we generally have experience in getting ready for spikes in demand for known events like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods,\" Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told investors on the call. \"The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation.\" Additionally, in an April memo to sellers, one of the top executives that oversees Amazon's sprawling marketplace, Dharmesh Mehta, acknowledged the situation \"is definitely not business as usual.\" As it raced to keep up with a spike in online orders, it also faced growing unrest among warehouse workers across the country. Workers who feared for their safety on the job were absent for weeks or more than a month as they took advantage of unlimited unpaid time off (a policy that has since been eliminated). Inside warehouses, social distancing rules meant workers were farther apart than usual, which slowed down the process of getting packages out the door. The company has hired more than 175,000 warehouse workers and delivery drivers to better keep up with the demand.\n\nGiven the scale of the issues at hand and their variability, Amazon has hesitated to provide any kind of prediction for when delivery times will return to normal. The pandemic has made it harder for Amazon to source more products at its warehouses when it needs them. If a shopper places an order for an out-of-stock item, Amazon can usually take steps to get that product quickly from another fulfillment center. Those levers have largely been inaccessible during the pandemic, and its remaining options take longer to deliver or are much more costly, Thomson said. For example, Amazon may be relying more on trucking amid higher air cargo costs and limited capacity. Trucking is inherently slower than flying packages across the country. It's a problem that's especially difficult to solve because Amazon \"can hire a million new people, but it doesn't matter if there's no air cargo,\" Thomson said. \"One of the reasons Fulfillment by Amazon is so good is they have so many modes of shipping,\" Thomson said. \"They figured out how to optimize all those pieces, but all of a sudden, those pieces don't exist. Amazon is having to optimize its network using higher expense or longer time transportation modes.\" These types of efficiencies are crucial in order to reduce delivery delays, Olsavsky said on the call. \"The cost structure, the ability to get products, your capacity for shipping and delivering, those are usually things that you can take for granted,\" Olsavsky said. \"And in this quarter you can't. That's really where the uncertainty is driven.\"\n\nSellers bear the brunt\n\nThird-party merchants told CNBC they felt the company made the right decision by prioritizing essential items, but that it also created headaches for their businesses. Merchants said the quantity restrictions mean they won't be able to ship in all the inventory they were hoping to sell. As a result, they won't be able to restock some products, even some that are best-selling items on the site. All the while, demand for goods remains at levels similar to Black Friday. \"There's no doubt that the US response to this crisis has been to buy more things online,\" said Chris Palmer, an Amazon seller and CEO of SupplyKick, which advises sellers and brands. \"Amazon's hallmark is being the everything store and all of a sudden you have hundreds of millions of people that want a very narrow selection of products, like face masks and toilet paper. \"I don't think Amazon was very well set up for that,\" Palmer added.", "author": ["Annie Palmer"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/09/coronavirus-cdc-director-to-self-quarantine-for-two-weeks.html", "published": "2020-05-10T01:47:38", "title": "Anthony Fauci will follow 'modified' quarantine after exposure to White House aide with coronavirus", "text": "US President Donald Trump (L) listens as Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci speaks during the daily briefing on the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, at the White House on March 24, 2020, in Washington, DC.\n\nWhite House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci will follow a \"modified\" quarantine after \"low-risk\" exposure to a White House aide who tested positive for coronavirus, an administration official told NBC News.\n\nFauci is expected to work mostly from home, but may go into his office while observing social distancing and wearing a face mask, the official said.\n\nFauci is the third high-ranking member of the White House coronavirus task force to enter some form of quarantine.\n\nThe director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert Redfield, is also expected to self quarantine after exposure to a White House aide who tested positive for coronavirus, two administration officials told NBC News, as is FDA Director Stephen Hahn.\n\nRedfield and Hahn will testify before a Senate hearing on reopening the economy via videoconference from self quarantine Tuesday.

Now, he's hoping that as states and communities slowly start coming back online, his own fortunes as well as those of the rest of the country will start to improve. Leff, the CEO of Hand & Stone Massage and Facial Spa, has seen this before, through the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks and the financial crisis that exploded in 2008. Both times, he's heard much talk of things getting back to normal after largely unforeseen disruptions. But if he learned anything from the two seminal crises, it's that things never really do return as they were. \"We never got back to normal. We created a new way of doing business,\" he said. \"We will have that happen here as well. We have a resilient economy.\"\n\nLeff spoke the same day as the world digested some of the most devastating economic news in U.S. history: The Labor Department reported that businesses shed 20.5 million workers from payrolls during April as the unemployment rate climbed to 14.7%, both numbers well beyond anything the country has seen since World War II. They were far worse than the financial crisis or 9/11 and a testament to just how much of a depressant the coronavirus containment measures have been to activity. But they also are backward-looking. More current numbers, like weekly jobless claims, are showing that even though the damage is still awful, the worst is likely behind. That's where entrepreneurs like Leff come in.\n\nTemporary for many, but not all\n\nOne bright spot from the jobs report was that 18.1 million of the layoffs were reported as temporary. So while some jobs won't be coming back after the lockdown, most, at least for now, will. Leff has begun reopening some of the more than 450 Hand & Stone franchise operations that were shut, and he's calling back some workers as locations open in Georgia, Utah, Colorado, Texas and Florida. Running a literally hands-on business poses its own challenges in the coroanvirus climate, but intense safety precautions the company is taking appear to be paying off. \"Our intent is to call back really the vast majority or maybe all our workers,\" he said. \"From our early state reopenings, we're actually seeing very encouraging numbers, both on the consumer side and the willingness of employees to come back to work.\" Not everyone is so eager. There are some workers at fast-food restaurants and other businesses who are earning more being unemployed under a government rescue program than they did on the job. They have been reluctant to return, according to several executives at job placement firms who spoke to CNBC. \"People are actually making more in unemployment than they would if they went back to work and exposed themselves to the Covid disease. One of the things we're seeing is a lot of the small businesses, a lot of these front-line companies, are having a difficult time in getting their employees back,\" said Irina Novoselsky, CEO at CareerBuilder.\n\nAn opportunity for seniors\n\nIn some cases, senior citizens, themselves an especially at-risk population, are taking those jobs. \"People over 65 actually are looking for jobs,\" Novoselsky said. \"An increasing amount of people are coming back to work in pretty unprecedented numbers.\"\n\nIndeed, Daniel Jan is looking to hire 1,500 such folks for his business, Seniors Helping Seniors, a franchise operation based in Reading, Pennsylvania, that matches up older caregivers with those in need of help. There's been a big demand for the services during the pandemic as the nursing home system has taken a black eye due to a high mortality rate in the facilities. In Jan's state, 2,458 of the 3,616 deaths, or 68%, have occurred in nursing homes, according to the Department of Health in Pennsylvania, which has some of the most stringent stay-at-home rules in the country. \"It's created an opportunity for those seniors again, giving them an opportunity to continue working while also giving something back,\" Jan said. \"There's this perception now that facility-based care is less safe. We are the alternative. On one hand, they're part of the highest-risk group. On the other hand, if they're home self-isolating, they are isolated and become lonely and they become depressed and need someone to check on them.

Making sense of rising equities and ultra-low Treasury yields", "text": "The stock and bond markets agree on zero right now. Meaning not that they disagree on everything, but that they agree zero is where the Federal Reserve will keep short-term interest rates for the foreseeable future. The way equity and government-bond prices incorporate this consensus on zero rates makes it appear to many as if the equity and fixed-income markets are offering divergent messages on the economic outlook. Yet there is less of a disconnect than might be obvious. The effect on bond yields is pretty straightforward. Market expectations for zero official rates indefinitely is anchoring Treasury yields, with the two-year note at a record low of 0.1% last week and some Fed funds futures contracts pricing in a prospect of negative overnight rates on the more distant horizon. This reality makes it tough to impute to the bond set-up much of a signal on what a recovery looks like beyond what is known: The Covid-19 shock and bulge in unemployment will keep the economy operating way below potential for a while, sapping inflationary pressures. It's become understandably popular to contrast this message of prolonged struggle with the relative resilience over in equity land, where the S&P 500 is up 33% in seven weeks and is less than 14% off its record high, while the Nasdaq is positive for the year. But it's not all that hard to reconcile the implied world views of equity and bond investors.\n\nGrowth stock dominance\n\nIt's first pretty important to define what the stock market represents now. The S&P 500 is now swayed to an unusual degree by a small number of enormous tech companies with dominant businesses and stable profitability. As has been widely notes, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook together amount to more than a fifth of the S&P 500's value, and make up 40% of the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq 100 has outperformed the industrial sector of the S&P 500 by more than 20 percentage points this year. The median stock in the broad S&P 1500 is still down more than 30% from its high. SunTrust strategist Keith Lerner notes that growth and defensive sectors represent 62% of today's S&P 500, a much higher weight in noncyclical companies than it had historically. In other words, the stock market has registered the poor economic outlook where it has the greatest relevance, in the more cyclical areas, which hold less sway in the benchmark. And the same deflationary forces and zero interest-rate floor that have the 10-year Treasury stuck below 0.7% also translate into a hefty premium placed on the scarce supply of reliable long-term cash flows represented by big growth companies. This doesn't mean the Nasdaq is attractively or correctly valued now. It doesn't change the fact that growth stocks' outperformance over value stocks has stretched to an historic extreme and the trend looks a bit vulnerable to a quick reversal. But the sturdy performance of the big-cap indexes thanks to this group means \"the stock market\" is not pricing in a cheery economic scenario about to unfold. In fact, signs of a handoff to early-cycle stocks have tentatively emerged the past two weeks, suggesting an improving \u2014 if not a satisfying \u2014 economic pace. The well-ingrained behavioral tendencies of markets also argue that stocks and bonds are not in fierce disagreement right now.\n\n'Very bad' to 'less bad'\n\nThroughout history, equities have done better when economic conditions are transitioning from \"very bad\" to \"less bad.\" For instance, according to Ned Davis Research, the best annualized returns for the S&P 500 have come when unemployment claims were very high but falling (as they have been in recent weeks \u2014 albeit lately giving devastating new definition to \"very high.\") Equities tend to attempt to look ahead several months and ride the direction of incremental change in conditions. The bond market, meantime, is only likely to start repricing yields aggressively higher if this incremental improvement is seen making the Fed less accommodative or driving inflation expectations higher. And yet, even at such low absolute levels, the spread between short- and long-term Treasury yields has widened quite a bit, which is typical of a market maneuvering for incremental economic improvement. And when investors have undergone a shock and urgent liquidation of risk assets, as they did in March, the resulting flight to cash and cautious psychology tends to keep Treasuries well-bid while also supporting equity valuations. Bank of America notes that another $55 billion entered money-market funds in the latest week \u2014 taking their assets to a ten-year high relative to total equity market cap \u2014 as equity funds saw their largest outflow since the March collapse. This abiding defensiveness, even as equities have risen nicely off their lows, is also starkly evident in last week's American Association of Individual Investors sentiment poll, showing bearish respondents exceeding bulls by the largest margin since early 2016. This is quite rare to see after stocks have been rallying for weeks, and serves as a contrarian bullish signal that the public remains skeptical of this market. Source: AAII This all helps explain how stocks got here and why that doesn't mean they're blithely ignoring the negatives that underpin today's bond prices. But it doesn't express clearly where stocks head in the immediate moment. The S&P has a bit more to prove on a technical basis, stalled at the upper end of a multi-week range and last week failing in several tries to break back up to April's post-crash high of 2955.

Five market experts weigh in on what this means for the U.S. economy.\n\n'Composition of the economy'\n\nKate Moore, head of thematic strategy for BlackRock's Global Allocation investment team, says investors should turn their focus to the composition of the economy rather than its size. \"There are so many variables in predicting economic growth over the next couple quarters or the next couple of years even. And so, as investors, you know, we can't focus so much on the size of the overall economy. I think the real project has to be the composition of the economy. And over the last six to eight weeks, we've started to see some consumption patterns change. What I'm really looking forward to is sort of thinking about the themes that are going to be dominant in the overall market. Where will people feel comfortable spending over the forward quarters? Where will businesses be putting their investments spent around technology [or] around systems? And, you know, really focusing on the composition, not the overall size. I have to say, as investors, it's tempting to look really far forward. We always want to have a long-term perspective in terms of forecasting earnings, or in terms of forecasting overall activity, and it is really challenging in this environment. So, getting to know balance sheets and really digging deep with management teams I think is the best way to pick the winners.\"\n\nContinued government intervention\n\nGlenn Hubbard, former economic advisor for the White House, says the government needs to continue to provide support during the economic recovery period. \"I think we could be back to the same level of GDP by late 2021 or early 2022. That's not a good news story, and it could well be worse. What we need is government intervention to continue. ... We've got to focus on the public health aspects first, the testing and tracing, and then see what it needs to be for a gradual reopening. And that's probably going to require continued support for businesses and employees during that period of reopening. Government really has to get its act together, and I say government meaning both the federal government, which provides a lot of the funding, but [also] the state government, where a lot of the action will occur\u2026 The Fed will be standing up its so-called Main Street lending facility, but we're going to need help for small businesses and mid-sized business employers. Whether it's partial wage credits, whether it's an extension of PPP, whether it's the Fed getting its act together, we need the Treasury Department active and thinking about these things now.\"\n\n2021 could be a 'boom year'\n\nJeremy Siegel, professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania, says future economic growth hinges on therapeutics and vaccines. \"There's something I emphasized very early on when we began to get this virus news, and I think it's an important reason why the stock market has actually held up so well, is that more than 90% of the value of stocks is from earnings more than 12 months in the future. These next 12 months are going to be [a] disaster \u2014 is a disaster \u2014 but stocks are the longest-lived assets and more than 90% of their value is earnings from the second quarter of 2021 beyond. Now, [how do we get there?] Depends on therapeutics, and vaccines. And that's why any encouraging news on that is so great for the stock market, far more important than whether unemployment claims are going up or down, or durable goods are going up or down. I mean, we know that this impact has been dramatic. If we get therapeutics that reduce the severity of this disease to a bad flu or a vaccine that could inoculate the at-risk members of the community, again that reduces that fear, [then] I think 2021 can be a boom year. With the liquidity that the Fed is adding, unprecedented, it could be a really good year.\"\n\nA 'U'-shaped recession\n\nDavid Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, says the stock market is not reflecting the severity of the economic impact. \"I think the stock market probably will see some further correction here. I think there are too many people betting on a 'V'-shaped recovery in the U.S. economy, but we think it is a 'U'-shaped recession. You know, this has carved out the first of the left wall of the 'U' year, but I think the unemployment will go up a little bit more in the next few months before it begins to come down, then it comes out very slowly. But I think we have to get into 2021 before we see a meaningful recovery, and I don't think that that is built into the stock market. As for the bond market, I don't think the rates ought to go lower here, because we are printing a huge amount of money to buy a huge amount of bonds. We could see another $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus here. So, at some stage down the road ... once we've got a recovery going, the Fed is going to have to raise rates. And that makes interest rates at these levels somewhat unappetizing, so I think both the bond market and the stock market are, to some extent, looking further ahead. I think the bond market can see that at some stages, there will be higher rates to pay for this. And I think the stock market is hoping that this thing's not too long, but, boy, is it deep, and I don't think the stock market is quite reflecting the depth of the recession that we're seeing right now.\"\n\nStock market looking ahead", "author": ["Ivana Freitas"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/why-the-market-is-up-even-with-historic-job-losses.html", "published": "2020-05-08T19:57:00", "title": "Why the stock market is up even with historic job losses", "text": "A record number of Americans just lost their job, and yet stocks are moving higher. This seems paradoxical given the economic toll \u2014 to say nothing of the emotional toll \u2014 on millions of people across the country without a job. While some say this is further indication that the stock market has become decoupled from reality, others say there are clear reasons why stocks have rebounded, and can continue to move higher. For one, the jobs data in and of itself is backward-looking. The April figures \u2014 which saw a record 20.5 million Americans lose their job \u2014 is from the height of the crisis. Since then, economies have begun to reopen. There is still a long way to go, of course, but the market is discounting what's going to happen six months from now, when most states will be getting back to business.\n\nStrategists also point out that the losses have been somewhat concentrated in the leisure and hospitality sector, whose underperformance has overshadowed strength in other areas of the market. And with the government and federal reserve providing record stimulus measures, some argue that once businesses do get back up and running, the recovery will be swift.\n\nThe S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite all opened higher on Friday, with the Dow surging more than 300 points. Since the March 23 low, all three averages have bounced more than 30%.\n\nWorst over?\n\nWhile the debate among health experts about how and when economies should reopen is ongoing, some states have already started easing shelter-in-place measures. A number of states including Florida began phase one reopenings on Monday. California became the latest state to lift some of its precautionary measures, with certain low-risk retailers allowed to open beginning Friday. \"The market knows that the job losses are self-inflicted due to the widespread shutdowns,\" Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar told CNBC. \"Thus, now that we are beginning the reopening process the market assumes many of these people will hopefully get hired back over the coming months and quarters.\"\n\nAdditionally, 78% of those who lost their job in April said they were furloughed, meaning the unemployment in theory will be temporary. Goldman strategist Jan Hatzius said this is an important distinction to make, given that it suggests the recovery will be swifter. \"If job losses are concentrated in this segment [furlough], it would increase the scope for a more rapid labor market recovery when the economy eventually rebounds (because employees can be recalled to their previous jobs, as in several past recessions),\" he wrote in a note to clients ahead of the report.\n\nPockets of strength?\n\nAt first the market sell-off was broad in nature as the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus sent the major averages tumbling into a bear market at the fastest pace on record. But since then, the divide between the winners and losers widened. Unsurprisingly stocks most exposed to the coronavirus threat \u2014 including hotels and airlines \u2014 have continued to trade lower. But other names are showing strength. On Thursday the Nasdaq went positive for the year, as names like Netflix and Amazon surged to all-time highs. \"Large companies have fallen much less than smaller companies. It is likely that as a result of this crisis the strong will get stronger ... and so the stock market is reflecting that in its relative valuation,\" Peter Orszag, Financial Advisory CEO at Lazard and former OMB director under Obama, said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"The US consumer has proven to be the economic engine over the last decade, and investors who are buying heavily into this market believe that behavioral changes are unlikely to create a dislocation in demand longer than a couple of quarters,\" added Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private Wealth. That said, Saccocia said a more cautious tone is warranted, since she believes it's a \"misconception\" that demand for consumer services will return quickly once government edicts lift.\n\nOngoing stimulus?\n\nAs the coronavirus wreaked havoc on markets, governments and central banks around the world stepped in in an effort to prop up prices. In March, President Donald Trump signed into law a record $2 trillion federal stimulus package known as the CARES Act, while the Federal Reserve announced that it would engage in unlimited asset purchases. \"While the collapse in economic activity is historic, so too is the global policy response to cushion the impact and support a recovery as containment measures are relaxed,\" JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic said in a recent note to clients. \"We estimate the impact of Fed easing in both rates and credit more than compensate for the temporary hit to corporate earnings when valuing the US market via discounted earnings,\" he added.\n\nZero rates?\n\nAs part of its stimulus measures, the Federal Reserve in March slashed interest rates to near zero. At the central bank's most recent meeting at the end of April, it pledged to keep rates at historic lows until the economy recovers. This supports economic activity since it makes borrowing money cheaper. \"Interest rates are going to be extremely low -- barely positive -- for a very long period of time, so that does provide some support to equity prices,\" noted Orszag.\n\nLooking forward", "author": ["Pippa Stevens"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/coronavirus-and-the-economy-how-the-fed-is-fighting-covid-19.html", "published": "2020-05-08T19:24:40", "title": "How the Fed's fighting to keep Covid-19 from causing an extended financial crisis", "text": "The U.S. Federal Reserve is trying to keep the coronavirus crisis from becoming an extended financial crisis.\n\nThe Covid-19 outbreak brought the U.S. economy to a standstill.

Some consider this week's landmark decision by Germany's Constitutional Court, casting doubt on the European Central Bank's authority for its public sector bond buying, as just another nail in that supranational coffin following the United Kingdom's departure.\n\nAs always in EU matters, however, the truth is more complicated. The European Union remains a heavyweight economic force with 22% of global GDP in 2018, which falls to some 18.5 % after Brexit. It maintains its uncontested role as the world's regulatory superpower. Beyond that, EU countries through a host of government-supported schemes have kept their pandemic-era unemployment at the far lower rate of 6.6% in March than in the United States, where it is 14.7% and rising. The real Covid-19 threat to the European Union isn't one of its impending collapse but rather one of its perceived irrelevance as a public defender and global actor. The danger is that the coronavirus period could so seriously dent public confidence in the EU's value and so damage its international ability to act cohesively that its relevance to its own citizens and the world could suffer a stunning blow.\n\nWhat is not well enough understood even by Europeans, let alone by Americans, are the global perils in a weaker and more vulnerable European Union. With a major power competition heating up between the United States and China, alongside a systemic struggle between authoritarian and democratic forms of government, how the European Union emerges from its Covid-19 challenges could be of decisive significance for world democracies.\n\nWhile the coronavirus reach is global, nowhere is a common cause more crucial than among European countries. Their coming together after World War II ended conflict, expanded democracy, and contributed to Soviet Communism's collapse. The EU's enlargement after the Cold War sealed its position as one of history's great democratizing forces \u2013 and as well as one of the United States' greatest foreign policy accomplishments.\n\nThe timing of this historic test could not be more auspicious.\n\nToday marks the 70th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration of May 9, 1950, when French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman proposed to place French and West German production of coal and steel under a common High Authority, open to participation of other West European countries.\n\n\"Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan,\" said the declaration with its modest language and extraordinary ambition to pacify a continent that had produced two world wars. \"It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity. The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany.\"\n\nIt was a cruel irony that in this anniversary week the German Constitutional Court would conjure up a new, fundamental challenge to the European Union. The judges put the European Central Bank on notice, arguing that the ECB had failed to conduct a \"proportionality assessment\" of bond buying to ensure \"economic and fiscal effects\" didn't exceed the bank's mandate and outweigh other policy objectives.\n\nThe ticking time bomb is that the court told the Bundesbank, by far the most significant central bank for eurozone monetary operations, to stop buying any more bonds within three months if the ECB didn't comply.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde, a lawyer herself, didn't flinch from the challenge. \"We are an independent institution, answerable to the European Parliament, and driven by our mandate,\" she told Bloomberg in a webinar. \"We will continue to do whatever is needed, whatever is necessary, to deliver on that mandate. Undeterred.\"\n\nHowever, the specifics of the German court's ruling aren't as significant as the signal they send to other European countries looking to challenge the authority of EU institutions. The decision comes against the current European background music, heard particularly in Italy and Spain, where European solidarity has been lacking in the virus fight.\n\nThe economic numbers don't help.\n\nThe European Commission said this week in its spring forecast that the pandemic-triggered economic slump \"could ultimately threaten the stability of the economic and monetary union.\"\n\nIt pointed to \"severe distortions within the single market and to entrenched economic, financial and social divergences between euro area member states\" as primary risks.\n\nThose, in term, could feed growth gaps among the European states that could exacerbate tensions. It forecasts more than 9% GDP declines in 2020 for Greece, Italy and Spain. Germany would suffer less, with a 6.5% fall in growth.\n\nAlthough the European Union has been slow to move, this week brought encouraging news of new momentum, including what The Economist called the welcome emergence of a \"genuinely European debate.\"\n\nThe EU confirmed a $3.3 billion commitment to help countries of the Western Balkans fight the pandemic, at a time when concerns were growing several countries were more closely aligning themselves with Russia and an increasingly assertive and generous China.\n\nThe move came after a virtual EU-Western Balkans summit, where the 27 leaders of EU member states said \"this support and cooperation goes far beyond what any other partner has provided to the region and deserves public acknowledgment.\"\n\nWhat China can't offer states in the Western Balkans is the prospect of EU membership, and that's what Brussels did in March for Albania and North Macedonia. Accession talks could start within a year. But the road ahead will be a long one for them and four other aspiring countries of the Western Balkans, all of which \"belong in the European Union,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nLast Monday, the EU-led fundraising campaign for Covid-19 vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics reached some $7.5 billion euros, including 1.4 billion from the EU. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has warned that the EU faces \"a moment of truth\" for its political project, kicked in 500 million euros.\n\nIt's not too late for the EU to demonstrate its resilience and relevance at this time of crisis. On this 70th anniversary, it's also worth remembering the common global and transatlantic interest in European stability and success.\n\nFrederick Kempe is a best-selling author, prize-winning journalist and president & CEO of the Atlantic Council, one of the United States' most influential think tanks on global affairs.

He was 87.\n\nPastor Bill Minson, a close friend of Little Richard's, told The Associated Press that Little Richard died Saturday morning. Minson said he also spoke to Little Richard's son and brother.\n\nMinson added that the family is not releasing the cause of death.\n\nBorn Richard Penniman, Little Richard was one of rock 'n' roll's founding fathers who helped shatter the color line on the music charts, joining Chuck Berry and Fats Domino in bringing what was once called \"race music\" into the mainstream. Richard's hyperkinetic piano playing, coupled with his howling vocals and hairdo, made him an implausible sensation \u2014 a gay, black man celebrated across America during the buttoned-down Eisenhower era.\n\nHe sold more than 30 million records worldwide, and his influence on other musicians was equally staggering, from the Beatles and Otis Redding to Creedence Clearwater Revival and David Bowie. In his personal life, he wavered between raunch and religion, alternately embracing the Good Book and outrageous behavior.\n\n\"Little Richard? That's rock 'n' roll,\" Neil Young, who heard Richard's riffs on the radio in Canada, told biographer Jimmy McDonough. \"Little Richard was great on every record.\"\n\nIt was 1956 when his classic \"Tutti Frutti\" landed like a hand grenade in the Top 40, exploding from radios and off turntables across the country. It was highlighted by Richard's memorable call of \"wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom.\"\n\nA string of hits followed, providing the foundation of rock music: \"Lucille,\" \"Keep A Knockin',\" \"Long Tall Sally,\" \"Good Golly Miss Molly.\" More than 40 years after the latter charted, Bruce Springsteen was still performing \"Good Golly Miss Molly\" live.\n\nThe Beatles' Paul McCartney imitated Richard's signature yelps \u2014 perhaps most notably in the \"Wooooo!\" from the hit \"She Loves You.\" Ex-bandmate John Lennon covered Richard's \"Rip It Up\" and \"Ready Teddy\" on the 1975 \"Rock and Roll\" album.\n\nWhen the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opened in 1986, he was among the charter members with Elvis Presley, Berry, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, Sam Cooke and others.\n\nFew were quicker to acknowledge Little Richard's seminal role than Richard himself. The flamboyant singer claimed he paved the way for Elvis, provided Mick Jagger with his stage moves and conducted vocal lessons for McCartney.\n\n\"I am the architect of rock 'n' roll!\" Little Richard crowed at the 1988 Grammy Awards as the crowd rose in a standing ovation. \"I am the originator!\"\n\nRichard Wayne Penniman was born in Macon, Georgia, during the Great Depression, one of 12 children. He was ostracized because he was effeminate and suffered a small deformity: his right leg was shorter than his left.\n\nThe family was religious, and Richard sang in local churches with a group called the Tiny Tots. The tug-of-war between his upbringing and rock 'n' roll excess tormented Penniman throughout his career.\n\nPenniman was performing with bands by the age of 14, but there were problems at home over his sexual orientation. His father beat the boy and derided him as \"half a son.\"\n\nRichard left home to join a minstrel show run by a man known as Sugarloaf Sam, occasionally appearing in drag.\n\nIn late 1955, Little Richard recorded the bawdy \"Tutti Frutti,\" with lyrics that were sanitized by a New Orleans songwriter. It went on to sell 1 million records over the next year.\n\nWhen Little Richard's hit was banned by many white-owned radio stations, white performers like Pat Boone and Elvis Presley did cover versions that topped the charts.\n\nLittle Richard went Hollywood with an appearance in \"Don't Knock the Rock.\" But his wild lifestyle remained at odds with his faith, and a conflicted Richard quit the business in 1957 to enroll in a theological school and get married.\n\nRichard remained on the charts when his label released previously recorded material. And he recorded a gospel record, returning to his roots.\n\nA 1962 arrest for a homosexual encounter in a bus station restroom led to his divorce and return to performing.\n\nHe mounted three tours of England between 1962 and 1964, with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones serving as opening acts. Back in the States, he put together a band that included guitarist Jimi Hendrix \u2014 and later fired Hendrix when he was late for a bus.\n\nIn 1968, Richard hit Las Vegas and relaunched his career. Within two years, he had another hit single and made the cover of Rolling Stone.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Richard was battling a $1,000-a-day cocaine problem and once again abandoned his musical career. He returned to religion, selling Bibles and renouncing homosexuality. For more than a decade, he vanished.\n\n\"If God can save an old homosexual like me, he can save anybody,\" Richard said.\n\nBut he returned, in 1986, in spectacular fashion. Little Richard was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and appeared in the movie \"Down and Out in Beverly Hills.\"\n\nA Little Richard song from the soundtrack, \"Great Gosh A'Mighty,\" even put him back on the charts for the first time in more than 15 years. Little Richard was back to stay, enjoying another dose of celebrity that he fully embraced.\n\nMacon, Georgia, named a street after its favorite son. And Little Richard was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In August 2002, he announced his retirement from live performing. But he continued to appear frequently on television, including a humorous appearance on a 2006 commercial for GEICO insurance.\n\nRichard had hip surgery in November 2009 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, and asked fans at the time to pray for him.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Spencer Platt\n\nAmericans have lost jobs by the millions as the coronavirus pandemic continues to bludgeon the U.S. economy. However, many jobless workers stand to reap a financial benefit from their layoffs. Some could more than double their prior salaries. The distortion results from the $2.2 trillion economic relief bill enacted in March, which boosted jobless benefits to a level unseen since the unemployment insurance program was created in the 1930s. Around 40% of all workers could theoretically earn more while unemployed than going back to work, according to an analysis by Noah Williams, director of the Center for Research on the Wisconsin Economy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nCritics say the policy serves as a disincentive to return to work as states start re-opening their economies \u2014 in turn limiting the country's economic rebound, according to critics. Labor economists generally agree the situation isn't ideal. However, it's necessary given the extraordinary health and economic crises at hand, they said. \"This is definitely a second- or third-best solution to a very serious problem,\" said Stephen Wandner, senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance. \"But I'm not sure they had a much better way of dealing with this.\"\n\nThe relief law, known as the CARES Act, enhanced unemployment benefits in several ways. It boosted weekly benefits, increased their duration and extended jobless pay to previously ineligible groups like the self-employed. The law offered an extra $600 per week, funded by the federal government, to unemployment recipients. That infusion supplements the unemployment benefits typically doled out by a worker's state. While unemployment insurance is a joint federal-state program, states control key aspects like benefit levels and vary significantly in generosity. The average worker in more than half of states stands to collect more from unemployment than from their prior job, according to an analysis conducted by Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI.\n\nThese dynamics are largely a function of a state's wages and unemployment generosity. Generally, the lower the wages and the greater the unemployment benefits in a state, the more it pays to be unemployed. (This, of course, doesn't account for the negative effects of long-term unemployment such as suppressed wages or benefits like health insurance that an employer may offer.) More from Personal Finance\n\nCan't pay your rent? Here's what you should do\n\nUnemployment just hit 14.7% yet the market is way up\n\nFamilies of dead Covid-19 victims may have to give back stimulus checks States cap their maximum weekly unemployment pay, meaning the financial benefits of unemployment dissipate after a certain point for those making higher salaries. Take the accommodation and food services industry, for example. This industry category includes restaurant and hotel workers \u2014 among the worst-hit sectors of the U.S. economy as state lockdown orders led to mass layoffs in the hospitality sector.\n\nThe average worker in this industry, which employs 14 million people, makes $13.45 an hour \u2014 the lowest compared with other industries. These workers would benefit most under the unemployment system when compared to others \u2014 collecting 182% of their previous wages, according to a CNBC analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics and Labor Department data.\n\nThe dynamic could be especially lucrative for the typical fast-food worker, who would collect 219% of prior pay from unemployment, among the occupations that stands to benefit most. That wage replacement rate means the average worker would earn more than twice as much as from their regular job, which pays just $11 an hour.\n\nIn normal times, state unemployment benefits replace less than half of prior wages for out-of-work Americans. That's meant to incentivize individuals to find a new job and provide financial support until they do. The $600-a-week infusion aimed to boost that ratio to 100% \u2014 or, full wage replacement \u2014 for the average American. That makes sense when U.S. and state officials are urging people to stay home, forcing businesses to close and preventing huge swaths of people from looking for work, economists said.\n\nWorkers in New Mexico, for example, would replace 129% of their prior salaries on average from unemployment \u2014 the largest \"wage replacement rate\" among any state. In Kansas and Montana, more than half their respective state workforces could make more on unemployment than by working \u2013 the largest shares of any other states, according to Williams.\n\n\"I think it's a good compromise with the situation we're in,\" Jesse Rothstein, director of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley, and former chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor, said of the $600 payments. \"We needed to support families, and dramatically scale up the amount of benefits,\" he added. \"It would have been much, much worse without something like this.\" Absent a significant infusion, the economy would have suffered from even greater spending pullbacks as more people curtailed purchases and delayed rent payments to make ends meet, economists said. \"Giving extra income payments to people who make less than $20 an hour is pretty much getting money in the hands of people who need it to pay utility bills, buy groceries, and help [the economy] right now,\" said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.\n\nThat was the case for one Amazon warehouse worker in Kentucky. The worker, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of company reprisal, has been collecting unemployment benefits in the state since the end of April after the warehouse temporarily closed. The individual makes nearly double his typical pay from a 40-hour work week pre-pandemic \u2014 $1,150 a week from unemployment benefits compared with $600 a week from a $15-an-hour wage. (The company recently instituted a $2-per-hour temporary raise and increased overtime pay from 1.5 times to 2 times hourly pay, the worker said.)\n\nThis is definitely a second- or third-best solution to a very serious problem. But I'm not sure they had a much better way of dealing with this. Stephen Wandner senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance\n\nThe worker's warehouse has since re-opened, but the individual plans to take unpaid time off and collect unemployment benefits through July due to a risk of contracting the Covid-19 by returning to work \u2014 an especially fraught idea given that the worker is caring for high-risk family members due to health conditions. The $600-a-week additional payments are a \"relief,\" the person said. \"It eased financial strains in an already strained situation,\" the worker said. \"The [state benefit] would've kept the four walls up and everything else on. But it would be tight.\" Absent the $600-a-week payments, the worker would still opt to collect unemployment due to health concerns.\n\nThe beefed-up unemployment benefits was also an issue of expediency. State unemployment systems are clunky and outdated even in the best of times, economists said. Instating a more-complicated formula would have delayed benefits for months \u2013 a potentially devastating outcome for families in dire straits, they said. However, some critics believe taking additional time to ensure workers couldn't make more from the unemployment system than their previous job would have been worthwhile, even if it resulted in delays.\n\n\"I understand it could have added a little time,\" said Rachel Greszler, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. \"But I don't think it's a good argument for incentivizing unemployment.\" The Heritage Foundation believes the CARES Act enhanced benefits could increase unemployment by nearly 14 million people and reduce U.S. gross domestic product by up to $1.49 trillion. The $600 weekly payments are ending after July 31, however, after which point Congress would have to extend them. Economists don't believe that's likely.\n\nBut there are mechanisms that will blunt any adverse impacts of people choosing not to return to work, economists said. For one, if workers refuse a work offer \u2014 say, from a prior boss who'd furloughed them or laid them off \u2014 they generally won't be able to continue collecting unemployment. Because more than 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment over the past seven weeks, state unemployment funds are being drained quickly, giving states an incentive not to be lenient in their interpretations of who can continue to collect benefits, Stevenson said. States may also try to claw back some unemployment pay in certain circumstances like fraud.", "author": ["Greg Iacurci"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/09/coronavirus-ppp-may-have-left-minority-business-owners-behind.html", "published": "2020-05-09T13:33:12", "title": "Paycheck Protection Program may have left minority business owners behind due to an implementation failure", "text": "A worker for United Parcel Service Inc.

The reversal came after receiving severe backlash from law-enforcement authorities and politicians, who argued that the reforms threatened public safety. Sandra Mayson, an assistant professor at University of Georgia School of Law who has researched bail reform, said the pandemic is forcing local criminal justice systems to take stock of who is in their jails and why, which is \"not something they had been doing with regularity.\"\n\nA Sheriff's deputy and on-site nurse give medications to an inmate at Las Colinas Women's Detention Facility in Santee, California, on April 22, 2020. Sandy Huffaker | AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"The bail reform conversation has lately been centered on who's dangerous enough to need to be detained, when it's really about public safety,\" Mayson said. \"Too often in my view, people assume that the calculus is a tradeoff between public safety on one hand and the liberty of the accused on the other. There are public safety concerns on each side of the equation.\" According to a 2015 study, people detained before trial were four times as likely to be sentenced to incarceration than those released before trial. People held for 8-14 days before trial were more likely to recidivate, or commit more crime, after completing their sentence.\n\nWe're all being forced to confront the extreme threat in jails and the threat of having too many people in jails. Sandra Mayson University of Georgia School of Law\n\nMayson said people usually forget that throwing someone in jail is a dangerous situation in the first place. \"Now the danger in jails is very real,\" Mayson said. \"We're all being forced to confront the extreme threat in jails and the threat of having too many people in jails.\" About 2.3 million are incarcerated in the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest prison population in any country by far \u2014 with nearly 83% in state prisons or local jails. People not found guilty of a crime accounted for 95% of jail population growth from 2000 to 2014, according to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Incarcerating people before trial costs U.S. taxpayers $38 million a day, according to a 2017 report from Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research organization. That adds up to nearly $14 billion annually. In contrast to New York, California passed an April 6 emergency bill setting bail at zero for misdemeanors and low-level felonies and postponing trials that could result in evictions or foreclosures.\n\nEliminating money bail just a 'first step'\n\nSome reform advocates argue that these issues span much further than money bail. The Pretrial Justice Institute says on its website that eliminating money bail, while a necessary first step, does not fully \"address bias and unequal outcomes.\" It suggests various additional methods of improving pretrial justice, including reducing arrests, restricting detention and increasing the equity of marginalized communities in decision-making. Esquenazi said most people ignore that bail bond companies ensure that the accused will appear in court and \"the crime victim could always have his/her day in court.\" \"Our industry is not the demonic spawn of Satan,\" Esquenazi said. \"We have been attacked, and it really is unwarranted, especially here in New York.\" Mayson said that while she has sympathy for the individuals running bail bond businesses, the industry as a whole poses a significant problem to mass incarceration. \"In the aggregate, unfortunately, I think it's an industry that has been built on the backs of the poor,\" she said. \"And it does dramatically more harm than good.\"\n\n2.3 million are incarcerated in the U.S., the world's largest prison population in any country, with nearly 83% in state prisons or local jails.

As of April 1, more than 1,400 NYPD officers had tested positive for COVID-19, and one out of six NYC officers were out sick or in quarantine. The number of inmates in New York City jails fell more than 1,100 \u2014 roughly 20% of the city's jail population \u2014 between March 16 and April 6, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio's office. Clayton said he does not think the circumstances of the pandemic warranted releasing prisoners. \"We've got an emergency, and the last thing police and fire departments need to be doing is handling additional crimes,\" he said. Mayson said releasing inmates, along with reducing arrests in the first place, is a \"logical approach\" to improving the criminal justice system. \"It is so patently within the realm of the possible \u2014 and not even that hard \u2014 to reduce the number of people in the jails that we have,\" she said.", "author": ["Sully Barrett"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/09/dividend-etfs-still-winners-despite-sp-500-dividend-cuts-analyst.html", "published": "2020-05-09T13:15:01", "title": "Dividend payers are still 'winners in this market,' ETF analyst says.

Here's what experts are saying", "text": "A pedestrian adjusts his facemask while walking past a closed Artisan House restaurant in Los Angeles on May 7, 2020. Frederic J. Brown | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic continues to disrupt economies and lives in ways we never could have imagined. But the world won't stay on lockdown forever. We asked public health and industry experts to share their thoughts on what things will look like when the pandemic finally recedes. In this segment of our series \"The Next Normal,\u2033 we look at what experts are saying about when restaurants and bars may reopen for business. Restaurants and bars have been among the hardest-hit businesses during coronavirus quarantines. While some establishments will reopen with limited capacity sooner rather than later, the sector is likely to face widespread decimation, according to industry and health experts. The National Restaurant Association projected the industry would take in $899 billion in sales in 2020 before coronavirus quarantines swept across the country. But most depend on consistent cash flow to keep their doors open and people employed. Since widespread lockdowns began in March, more than 8 million restaurant industry employees have lost their jobs or have been furloughed, according to a survey of 6,500 establishments by the association. That equates to a loss of $80 billion through April, and up to $240 billion by the end of the year. While some restaurants and bars have pivoted to offering takeout and delivery, many others chose to close their doors entirely for the duration of local lockdowns. That could be a death knell for thousands of locations. The California Restaurant Association estimated in late March that 30% of the state's 90,000 restaurants would not survive the crisis. Restaurant owners are facing steep costs to reopen, including hiring back staff, paying off invoices and replacing spoiled ingredients. Even the country's best restaurants won't bounce back from prolonged closures. \"There is definitely a question mark over Eleven Madison Park \u2014 if it will reopen,\" Daniel Humm, the owner of the three-Michelin-star New York restaurant, told Bloomberg Pursuits this week. \"It will take millions of dollars to reopen. You have to bring back staff. I work with fancy equipment in a big space. I want to continue to cook with the most beautiful and precious ingredients in a creative way, but at the same time, it needs to make sense.\"\n\nWhat reopening might look like\n\nFrom a public health standpoint, restaurants and bars should have an easier path to reopening than arenas, schools and many offices because owners or managers can space out tables and limit capacity, said Dr. Peter Bach, a physician and epidemiologist at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where he also runs the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes. Restaurants in Asia are providing U.S. owners with a model of how to reopen their dining rooms, with wider spacing between tables, customer temperature checks and masked wait staff. Black Sheep, a Hong Kong-based restaurant chain, has publicly shared its 17-page playbook on how it is navigating the pandemic. Suggestions include requiring customers to sign health declaration forms before entering the restaurant and offering a hygienic way to store masks during a meal. Black Sheep co-founder Syed Asim Hussain said that he has heard from restaurateurs from around the world about the guidelines and how to adapt their businesses. \"I've been telling them, if anyone is waiting for things to go back to how they were, you'll be waiting a long time,\" Hussain said.\n\nA pedestrian wearing a protective mask walks in front of a temporarily closed Starbucks coffee shop in Brooklyn, New York, on Monday, April 27, 2020. Gabby Jones | Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nStarbucks plans to reopen 85% of its U.S. coffee shops by the end of this week, emphasizing cashless payments and contactless and curbside pickup. \"The foundation of our approach comes from what we have learned in China, where more than 98 percent of our stores are now open and operating under revised protocols,\" Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said in letter Monday to Starbucks employees and customers. California restaurants have already drafted their own proposed plan to allow the industry to reopen with an array of safeguards, like requiring servers to wear masks and placing hand sanitizer on every table, while avoiding more drastic measures such as taking every customer's temperature upon entrance, The Associated Press reported this week. The plans are only recommendations and haven't been approved by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Social distancing will need to be part of any proposal to reopen, said Dr. Ashish Jha, professor of health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Jha recommended 50% capacity cuts, while noting that \"even 50% capacity feels a lot to me with bars.\" \"I don't know that you even want to get to 75% without a vaccine,\" he said. The problem is opening doors at 50% capacity probably is seldom economically feasible. \"For most restaurants to open and only have 50% of their seats occupied indoors, they're probably not going to make enough money to stay open \u2014 unless they sell a lot of alcohol,\" said Stephani Robson, senior lecturer at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration. In Texas and Georgia, where restaurants were allowed last Friday to reopen dining rooms with limited capacity, fewer than half of restaurant operators resumed operations that day, according to Black Box Intelligence.\n\nMore than an economic question\n\nEven if restaurants find it economically feasible to reopen, there's no guarantee Americans would feel safe enough to show up in the numbers necessary for a recovery. In fact, 68% percent of Americans say they would feel uncomfortable eating at a restaurant, according to a late April survey from SAP's Qualtrics, the employee management software company. Building up the courage to return to restaurants may be one of the most essential elements to returning to normal, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. Restaurants can serve as a confidence bellwether for Americans who are dipping their toes back into normal society, he said. \"People miss it, and it's relatively inexpensive,\" Gordon said. \"We're going to go stir crazy. It's something that doesn't require a lot of planning. And it's public, so other people will see it and ask themselves, 'Am I ready for this?''\" But confidence becomes a chicken-and-egg question, as the current lack of consumer demand will likely cause restaurants and bars to stay closed. If restaurants were to reopen and demand was poor, employees whom they tried to hire back would no longer be eligible for unemployment because they'd have a job opportunity that they were turning down. That's an incentive to keep doors shut until it's clear people are ready to come back. \"It doesn't matter what Trump or any governor might say, when people still see the number of deaths in their state or region are considerable, people aren't going to participate in normal everyday life,\" said former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who teaches public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. \"They're not going to feel safe going back to crowded airplanes, restaurants, bars, sporting events, anything.\" Restaurants may also be reluctant to reopen for liability reasons. \"If business interruption insurance didn't cover the industry when this happened, what makes them feel that the insurance companies would cover them on the liability of coronavirus lawsuits?\" said Aaron Allen, founder and CEO of restaurant consultancy Aaron Allen & Associates.\n\nFast food will bounce back first\n\nFast-food chains have largely weathered the coronavirus quarantines, leaning on drive-thru lanes, delivery and lower prices. Same-store sales declined less than 2% in the week ended April 26 compared with a year earlier, according to industry tracker Black Box Intelligence.\n\nFast food restaurant chain, Wendy's seen in Tokyo, Japan.

Chick-fil-A, the third-largest U.S. restaurant company by sales, is preparing to reopen some restaurants for takeout by installing plexiglass partitions at its front counters and adding more hand sanitizer stations. Floor decals will help customers maintain their distance from other people. Shake Shack CEO Randy Garutti said that there will be fewer cashiers and self-order kiosks inside the burger chain's locations. Shake Shack is also planning to modify restaurants with drive-thru lanes and pick-up windows.

Because they were a 5% holder before the company went public, Pershing Square was able to be a 13G filer even though they were not a passive holder. However, they were required to convert to a 13D filing when they acquired an additional 2% beneficial ownership within a year. That is what necessitated this filing.\n\nQSR is comprised of Burger King, Popeyes and Tim Hortons and is a pure franchising company. So, with very little capex, the company just collects royalties which leaves it in an excellent position to weather the current COVID crisis. The Burger King brand was a turnaround story that was accomplished by 3G Capital and management. Tim Horton's is in a similar situation right now with flat same store sales, and Popeyes is doing great.\n\nPershing Square increased its position because it thinks the stock is cheap and is one example of throwing the baby out with the bathwater during the COVID crisis.

As of Thursday's close, the S&P 500 has gained more than 30% from its virus low.\n\nSiegel, a longtime bull, said he believes the only way the stock market could retest the March 23 bottom is if there were a more severe coronavirus outbreak in the fall and full-scale lockdowns have to be implemented once again.\n\n\"I don't think that's going to happen.

Since then, economies have begun to reopen. There is still a long way to go, of course, but the market is discounting what's going to happen six months from now, when most states will be getting back to business.\n\nStrategists also point out that the losses have been somewhat concentrated in the leisure and hospitality sector, whose underperformance has overshadowed strength in other areas of the market.

California became the latest state to lift some of its precautionary measures, with certain low-risk retailers allowed to open beginning Friday. \"The market knows that the job losses are self-inflicted due to the widespread shutdowns,\" Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar told CNBC. \"Thus, now that we are beginning the reopening process the market assumes many of these people will hopefully get hired back over the coming months and quarters.\"\n\nAdditionally, 78% of those who lost their job in April said they were furloughed, meaning the unemployment in theory will be temporary. Goldman strategist Jan Hatzius said this is an important distinction to make, given that it suggests the recovery will be swifter. \"If job losses are concentrated in this segment [furlough], it would increase the scope for a more rapid labor market recovery when the economy eventually rebounds (because employees can be recalled to their previous jobs, as in several past recessions),\" he wrote in a note to clients ahead of the report.\n\nPockets of strength?\n\nAt first the market sell-off was broad in nature as the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus sent the major averages tumbling into a bear market at the fastest pace on record. But since then, the divide between the winners and losers widened. Unsurprisingly stocks most exposed to the coronavirus threat \u2014 including hotels and airlines \u2014 have continued to trade lower. But other names are showing strength. On Thursday the Nasdaq went positive for the year, as names like Netflix and Amazon surged to all-time highs. \"Large companies have fallen much less than smaller companies. It is likely that as a result of this crisis the strong will get stronger ... and so the stock market is reflecting that in its relative valuation,\" Peter Orszag, Financial Advisory CEO at Lazard and former OMB director under Obama, said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"The US consumer has proven to be the economic engine over the last decade, and investors who are buying heavily into this market believe that behavioral changes are unlikely to create a dislocation in demand longer than a couple of quarters,\" added Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private Wealth. That said, Saccocia said a more cautious tone is warranted, since she believes it's a \"misconception\" that demand for consumer services will return quickly once government edicts lift.\n\nOngoing stimulus?\n\nAs the coronavirus wreaked havoc on markets, governments and central banks around the world stepped in in an effort to prop up prices. In March, President Donald Trump signed into law a record $2 trillion federal stimulus package known as the CARES Act, while the Federal Reserve announced that it would engage in unlimited asset purchases. \"While the collapse in economic activity is historic, so too is the global policy response to cushion the impact and support a recovery as containment measures are relaxed,\" JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic said in a recent note to clients. \"We estimate the impact of Fed easing in both rates and credit more than compensate for the temporary hit to corporate earnings when valuing the US market via discounted earnings,\" he added.\n\nZero rates?\n\nAs part of its stimulus measures, the Federal Reserve in March slashed interest rates to near zero. At the central bank's most recent meeting at the end of April, it pledged to keep rates at historic lows until the economy recovers. This supports economic activity since it makes borrowing money cheaper. \"Interest rates are going to be extremely low -- barely positive -- for a very long period of time, so that does provide some support to equity prices,\" noted Orszag.\n\nLooking forward", "author": ["Pippa Stevens"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/bitcoin-btc-cryptocurrency-prices-rise-as-halving-approaches.html", "published": "2020-05-08T05:45:03", "title": "Cryptocurrency market jumps by over $13 billion driven by bitcoin as major technical event approaches", "text": "Mehmet Ali Ozcan | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nA rally in bitcoin led the cryptocurrency market higher ahead of a major technical event for the digital coin and as industry participants report an increased interest from institutional investors. Bitcoin crossed $10,000 on Friday morning Singapore time, the first time it has hit that price since February, according to data from CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency had pared some of those gains and was trading around $9,900.75 as of 1:39 p.m. Singapore time, still representing a more than 6.4% rise from the day before. The entire market capitalization or value of the cryptocurrency market had jumped by more than $13 billion from the day before, as of around 1:39 p.m. Singapore time. That move had been largely driven by bitcoin which makes up most of that figure. The value of the entire market stood at $268.07 billion.\n\nIndustry participants said that a number of factors \u2014 from supportive central bank monetary policy to increased interest from institutional investors \u2014 has factored into the bitcoin rally. Bitcoin suffered two bouts of intense selling in March sending it to a low of around $3,867, a price not seen since March 2019. Since then, the price has rallied over 150%. Meanwhile, stock markets, which also saw sharp drops in March, have recovered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28.4% since its March low. \"Overall markets have been bullish since the March lows and this is across asset classes, including crypto,\" Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"Money printing by the Fed and other central banks globally have given a lot of confidence to investors that the economy will be supported no matter what.\" The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced a number of unprecedented measures to help cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak. Other central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank (ECB), have unveiled their own stimulus packages. Central bank policies are seen as supportive of risk assets like stocks.\n\nThe 'halving'\n\nPart of the rise in bitcoin's price since the March low has been anticipation of a technical event known as \"halving.\" Bitcoin is not issued by a centralized authority like fiat currencies are. That is why it is often called a \"decentralized\" cryptocurrency. Instead it is governed by code and is underpinned by a technology known as blockchain. In the world of bitcoin, so-called miners with specialized high-powered computers compete with each other to solve complex math problems to validate bitcoin transactions. Whoever \"wins\" this race gets rewarded in newly minted bitcoin. This \"mining\" activity happens in blocks, which is essentially a group of transactions joined into one. Currently, these miners receive 12.5 bitcoin per block mined. The rewards are halved every few years to keep a lid on inflation. On May 12, the reward per miner will be cut in half again, to 6.25 new bitcoin. The effect is that the supply of bitcoin coming onto the market is reduced. Previous halving events, which happen every four years, have preceded big price increases in bitcoin.\n\n\"For the past few weeks, we have seen additional players enter the BTC market as prices have trended upward in anticipation of the halving event as bulls saw this as an opportunity to buy BTC ahead of a price pop and what many expect will be significant price appreciation,\" Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a bitcoin index fund provider, told CNBC. BTC refers to bitcoin's currency code like USD for the U.S. dollar. \"This has undoubtedly continued into this week and may even carry over the weekend as the halving draws closer.\"\n\nInstitutional buying?\n\nDibb said there are other factors at play as well, including more institutional money flowing into bitcoin. Paul Tudor Jones, a high-profile Wall Street hedge fund manager, revealed in a message that one of his funds holds a low single-digit percentage in futures on the cryptocurrency, Bloomberg News reported. \"The news that renowned investor, Paul Tudor Jones, has backed bitcoin\u2014publicly praising the asset for its properties as a store of value has almost certainly helped catalyse BTC's sudden movement into the US$10,000 zone,\" Dibb said. \"With monetary easing policies and 'unlimited' economic stimuli being recently unveiled across the world, fiat currencies seem set to weaken substantially. This has, in turn, led to bitcoin's narrative as a 'store of value' to gain added traction amongst investors who are seeking to hedge against volatility in traditional markets.\" Bitcoin has often been compared to gold as a so-called safe haven asset during turbulent times for other risky assets like stock markets. However, recently, bitcoin has fallen and risen when stock markets have.\n\nFlashbacks to 2017?", "author": ["Arjun Kharpal"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/bubble-stocks-like-beyond-meat-and-peloton-were-supposed-to-blow-up-but-the-opposite-happened.html", "published": "2020-05-08T11:37:07", "title": "'Bubble' stocks like Beyond Meat and Peloton were supposed to blow up, but the opposite happened", "text": "Peloton machine Source: Peloton\n\nMany on Wall Street were convinced the usual playbook would occur when this market and economic downturn hit. Bubble-like tech stocks that led the way up would get crushed as a bear market exposed their hype and sent stock speculators scrambling. But the opposite has happened. The names skeptics used to point their fingers at are actually among the biggest winners this year, and their strength pushed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite into positive territory on Thursday. High-flyers Amazon and Netflix were the among the first stocks to fully make back the losses from the coronavirus sell-off that triggered the fastest bear market on record. Meanwhile, shares of Beyond Meat and Peloton rebounded violently, and are now up more than 50% each this year. Tesla is up a whopping 86%.\n\nIt turns out society shutting down to curb the spread of the coronavirus is good business for many of these speculative names. Investors flocked to their old loves Netflix and Amazon in the stay-at-home age, while cheering positive news from smaller players like Beyond Meat and Peloton. Beyond Meat reported that sales more than doubled in the first quarter thanks to newfound demand from its partners and retailers looking to bulk up on alternative meats in an age when meatpacking plants are shutting down because of the virus risk. Peloton said it held its largest class ever last week, with more than 23,000 people streaming it from home. The shares surged on Thursday after it said sales were up 66%. That is not to say these stocks didn't suffer from the market's historic rout at first as investors dusted off the old playbook. In fact, Beyond Meat, Tesla and Peloton all fell more severely than the S&P 500 during the rapid plunge. \"Several of these stocks did get hit hard initially,\" said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. \"It was only after the worst was over that people came running back into those names.\" \"Once investors saw that the Fed was going to provide a strong safety net, they came back into the market, but they still wanted to weight their holdings towards those that would actually benefit from the lockdown,\" Maley said.\n\n'Cult of personality'\n\nTesla is a different story. The stock had a massive run earlier this year, driven by analysts upping price targets and short covering by those who bet against Elon Musk's automaker. Many were worried Tesla might be a speculative bubble that sometimes occurs near the end of bull markets. \"Tesla is its own cult of personality,\" said Dan Nathan, principal of RiskReversal Advisors. \"When the history books are written on this period of the stock market, this is going to be a big asterisk.\" Shares of Tesla surged more than 40% in the past month, boosted by strong quarterly results with better-than-expected deliveries even amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGetting crowded again", "author": ["Yun Li"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/cargo-carriers-are-reaping-the-rewards-of-the-coronavirus-slowdown-in-air-travel.html", "published": "2020-05-07T21:01:11", "title": "Cargo carriers reap rewards of coronavirus chaos", "text": "A Boeing 747 cargo freighter belonging to the Atlas Air flies into the clouds after lifting off from Hong Kong International Airport, on 23 October 2017, in Hong Kong, Hong Kong.\n\nNot all airlines are reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.

ATSG posted net income of $133.7 million for the first quarter, compared with $22.6 million in the first three months of 2019, according to FactSet.

How can anyone possibly figure out what's going to happen to earnings when the companies themselves have admitted they don't know? Regardless, one of the defining characteristics of stock investors is that ignorance of the future has never stopped them from making bets \u2014 big bets, in some cases. The last few weeks have seen many unusual flows into exchange-traded funds that offer an insight into what those bets look like. Here are some broader themes:\n\nIs this the bottom?\n\nHow many times have you heard this story? Despite the worst possible outlook, some investors are trying to call bottoms in beaten-up industries like energy and airlines Shares outstanding in the S&P 500 Energy ETF, for example, have increased 45% since the beginning of April. It's even wilder for U.S. Global JETS ETF, a basket of mostly American airlines. Shares outstanding have gone from 1.5 million at the end of March to north of 40 million shares.\n\nThe winners will keep winning\n\nGold diggers\n\nA smaller but equally enthusiastic groupis continuing to pour money into gold ETFs. Call them the doom-and-gloomers: those who believe gold is a haven in uncertain times. Investment demand for gold is way up even as jewelry demand in China and India, the two largest jewelry markets in the world, is down. Shares outstanding in the largest ETF that holds gold directly, SPDR Gold Trust, are at their highest level since 2013, even as gold prices also hit a seven-year high, swelling the value of the fund to over $50 billion. Shares in competitor iShares Gold Trust have also skyrocketed.\n\nInto the US, out of everywhere else\n\nAnother noticeable trend: into America, out of Europe and Asia. There have been outflows in the largest European ETFs, including Vanguard FTSE Europe, SPDR EuroSTOXX 50, iShares MSCI Eurozone and iShares Core MSCI EAFE. The picture in emerging markets is a bit more nuanced, but in general there have been outflows from the larger funds as well, including Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets and iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF. Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, said it was no surprise investors were reducing exposure to areas with significant China influence. \"With expectations that China and other historically fast growing markets experiencing the same pain as the US, investors have chosen to reduce their risk profile,\" he wrote to me.\n\nWhat's it all mean?", "author": ["Bob Pisani"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/jim-cramer-plant-based-meat-is-a-trend-investors-should-not-ignore.html", "published": "2020-05-06T15:35:17", "title": "Cramer says the plant-based meat 'movement is happening' and investors better 'get on the bus'", "text": "CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday that investors cannot ignore the rising popularity of plant-based meat products.\n\n\"This movement is happening.

Priced at $25 per share, the stock saw a meteoric rise to nearly $240 by last July. But come December, it had lost about 70% of its value. In the early part of this year, the stock rebounded before falling off a cliff, bottoming at about $48 in mid-March. Since then, the stock has more than doubled.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, in addition to strong revenue, Beyond Meat posted quarterly net income of $1.8 million, up from a net loss of more than $6 million last year. It did warn of a hit to its restaurant business due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, the \"Mad Money\" host said he believes the plant-based meat industry may ultimately be beneficiaries of the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nMeatpacking plants across the U.S. have seen significant virus outbreaks, forcing some to slow down production or temporarily close as workers became sick. The developments ignited concerns about the country's food supply, although President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week requiring the plants to remain open during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"I think there are people who are getting appalled by what's happened at the meat packers. ...

David A. Grogan | CNBC\n\nWarren Buffett made a lot of news at Berkshire Hathaway's first virtual annual meeting on Saturday, including revealing that he sold all his airline stocks and didn't see any value in any major acquisitions amid the coronavirus pullback in stocks. The 89-year-old \"Oracle of Omaha\" was joined at the meeting with Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel and was asked shareholder questions by CNBC's Becky Quick. Here's a full recap:\n\n9:19 pm: Buffett takes question from actor Bill Murray\n\nMurray asked via Quick: \"This pandemic will graduate a new class of war veterans: Health care, food supply, deliveries, community services. So many owe so much to these few. How might this great country take our turn and care for all of them?\" Buffett: \"We won't be pay to pay, actually. It's like people that landed at Normandy...The poor, the disadvantaged... They suffer, there's an unimaginable suffering and at the same time they're doing all these things. They're working 24-hour days and we don't even know their names...If we go overboard on something, we ought to do things that can help those people. This country \u2014 I've said it a lot of times before \u2014 but the history of it. I mean we are a rich, rich, rich country and the people that are doing the kind of work that Bill talks about, they are contributing a whole lot more than some of the people that came out of the right womb. Or got lucky or know how to arbitrage bonds. And in large part, I'm one of those guys. So you really try to create a society that, under normal conditions, with more than $60,000 of GDP per capita, that anybody that works 40 hours a week can have a decent life without a second job and with a couple kids. They can't live like kings, I don't mean that. But nobody should be left behind.\" Murray and Buffett met up last year in Omaha over ice cream. \u2014 Franck\n\n9:03 pm: Buffett on why he didn't buy more Berkshire stock\n\nBuffett explained why he didn't repurchase more Berkshire Hathaway shares during the sell-off in the first quarter. The company only repurchased $1.7 billion of Berkshire shares even as it sits on a record $137 billion cash pile. \"The price has not been at a level where it really feels way better to us than other things, including the option value of money, to step up in a big way,\" he said. \u2014 Franck\n\n8:53 pm: Being against buybacks is now 'politically correct,' Buffett says\n\nBuffett said the criticism towards buybacks is largely uncalled for. \"It's very politically correct to be against buybacks now,\" he said. \"There's a lot of crazy things being said about buybacks. Buybacks are so simple. It's a way of distributing cash to shareholders.\" Buffett noted share repurchase programs should be executed in a price and need-sensitive manner, but \"when the conditions are right, it should also be obvious to repurchase shares and there shouldn't be the slightest taint to it anymore than there is to dividends.\" \u2014 Imbert\n\n8:40 pm: Buffett says he's not breaking up the conglomerate\n\nBuffett was asked whether he would consider breaking up Berkshire Hathaway. Here's his answer: \"If you were to sell Berkshire's various subsidiaries you would incur a very significant amount of tax at the corporate level before anything was distributed to the shareholders...The interaction of being able to move capital around in terms of being able to do in insurance that we couldn't do unless there were the backup earnings and capital employed. And the other entities -- there's enormous advantages in capital deployment within the place. There is not a big discount to break up value embodied in Berkshire's price...It isn't going to happen. Now I will tell you everybody in the world will come around and propose something and say 'it's wonderful for shareholders and, by the way, it involves huge fees.'...My plan has been thought out and in place for a long time. And it not only ensures that the money that's been made at Berkshire all of it ends up going to various philanthropies staggered over time, but it also --- it will keep the wolves away.\" Abel added: \"I think the comment on the capital allocation is critical. That we have the ability to move the capital among the --- be it the operating businesses or up to the insurance or down --- with really no consequences to our shareholders. That's the value driver, the unique structure of Berkshire and it creates immense value.\" \u2014 Franck\n\n8:27 pm: Buffett says he and Charlie Munger are in good health\n\nWarren Buffett said he and Charlie Munger, his longtime business partner, are in good health, adding the 96-year-old vice chairman will return to the annual meeting next year. The 89-year-old chairman and CEO said that Munger added Zoom Video to his repertoire and is having virtual meetings every day. Asked about future management who will allocate capital at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett listed Greg Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance operations, Todd Combs, Ted Weschler, his two key investing deputies. \"Charlie and I are around. We like capital allocation ourselves. We are not going any place voluntarily, but we probably will be going some places involuntarily before that long,\" Buffett said. \"Charlie is in good health. I'm in good health.\" \u2014 Li\n\n7:55 pm: Greg Abel doesn't see Berkshire's culture changing\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel \u2014 one of the potential successors to Warren Buffett \u2014 said he doesn't see the company culture changing whenever the \"Oracle of Omaha\" and his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, leave. \"A large part of that [culture] is having the business acumen to understand the transaction and economic prospects and the ability to act quickly,\" Abel said. \"I really don't see that changing. There's no one better than Warren and Charlie, but equally we have a talented team at Berkshire.\" \u2014 Imbert\n\n7:20 pm: Buffett says he's 'willing to do something very big,' but hasn't seen anything 'attractive'\n\nWarren Buffett hasn't made a major acquisition in several years despite Berkshire Hathaway's record cash pile. Buffett said it is because there hasn't been anything \"that attractive,\" \"We have not done anything because we haven't seen anything that attractive,\" Buffett said. \"We are not doing anything big obviously. We are willing to do something very big. I mean you could come to me on Monday morning with something that involved $30, or $40 billion or $50 billion. And if we really like what we are seeing, we would do it.\" Berkshire's quarterly earnings revealed that the conglomerate had a record $137 billion in cash and equivalent instruments on its balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. \u2014 Li\n\n7:10 pm: Buffett says he sold his entire stake in airlines\n\nBuffett reveals Berkshire dumped its entire airlines stake. \"The world has changed for the airlines. And I don't know how it's changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way,\" Buffett said. \"I don't know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.\" But \"I think there are certain industries, and unfortunately, I think that the airline industry, among others, that are really hurt by a forced shutdown by events that are far beyond our control,\" he added. Asked by CNBC's Quick to clarify if Berkshire had sold all of its airline holdings, Buffett answered \"yes.\" The prior stake, worth a collective several billion dollars, included United, American, Southwest and Delta Airlines. \u2014 Franck\n\n6:52 pm: Buffett now taking shareholder questions\n\nCNBC's Becky Quick has been collecting shareholder questions and is now asking Buffett the questions via a video link.\n\n6:42 pm: Buffett says he was 'wrong' about the airlines\n\nWarren Buffett said he made an \"understandable mistake\" when valuing the airline stocks as a near-global halt in travel due to the coronavirus sent their prices sharply lower. \"When we bought [airlines], we were getting an attractive amount for our money when investing across the airlines,\" he said. \"It turned out I was wrong about that business because of something that was not in any way the fault of four excellent CEOs. Believe me. No joy of being a CEO of an airline.\" \"I don't know that 3-4 years from now people will fly as many passenger miles as they did last year .... you've got too many planes.\" \u2014 Imbert, Quick\n\n6:32 pm: Buffett thinks highly of Fed Chief Jerome Powell\n\n\"I've always had Paul Volcker up on a special place, a special pedestal in terms of Federal Reserve chairmen over the years... Jay Powell in my view, and the Fed board, belong up there on that pedestal with him because they acted in the middle of March. Probably somewhat instructed by what they'd seen in 2008 and 2009. They reacted in a huge way and essentially allowed what's happened since that time to play out the way it has. March, when the market had essentially frozen, a little after mid-month, ended up on March 23 \u2014 it ended up being the largest month for corporate debt issuance, I believe, in history... Every one of those people that issued bonds in late March and April ought to send a thank you letter to the Fed because it wouldn't have happened if they hadn't operated with really unprecedented speed and determination.\" \u2014 Franck\n\n6:22 pm: The best thing to do is buy into S&P 500 index fund, Buffett says\n\nWarren Buffett believes average investors should buy the broad market for a long period of time instead of following stock-picking advice of others. \"In my view, for most people, the best thing is to do is owning the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual meeting. \"There are huge amounts of money people pay for advice they really don't need. If you bet on America and sustain that position for decades, you'd do far better than buying Treasury securities, or far better than following people who tell you\" what to invest, he added. \u2014 Li\n\n6:11 pm: Buffett \u2014 don't use borrowed money to participate in markets\n\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett still thinks America is the best bet out there but noted people should not borrow money to participate in market given the uncertainty around the coronavirus pandemic. \"When something like the current pandemic happens, it's hard to factor that in. That's why you never want to use borrowed money, at least in my view, into investments,\" Buffett said from Berkshire Hathaway's virtual shareholder's meeting. \"There's no reason to use borrowed money to participate in the great American tailwind, but there's every other reason to do so.\" \u2014 Imbert\n\n5:56 pm: Buffett says, 'be careful about how you bet.'\n\n\"Perhaps with a bias, I don't believe anyone knows what the market is going to do tomorrow, next week, next month, next year. I know America's going to move forward over time, but I don't know for sure and we learned this on Sept. 10, 2001. And we learned it a few months ago in terms of the virus. Anything can happen in terms of markets. And you can bet on America but you're going to have to be careful about how you bet. Simply because markets can do anything.\" Buffett has said that investors should never buy stocks on margin using borrowed money. \u2014 Franck\n\n5:50 pm: Stock market has produced $100 for every $1 since Buffett finished college\n\nFor every $1 invested when Warren Buffett finished college in the 1950s, the stock market has produced $100, the \"Oracle of Omaha\" pointed out during his presentation at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting.\n\n\n\n\"All you had to do was believe in America. You just had to believe that the American miracle that was intact,\" Buffett said. \"You didn't have to read the Wall Street Journal. You didn't have to look at the price of your stock. You didn't have to pay a lot of money in fees than anybody\u2026Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it.\" There was a testing period after the stock market crash of 1929 where a lot of people \"really lost faith,\" Buffett said. \"In the end the answer is never bet against America.\" \u2014 Li\n\n5:10 pm: Buffett: Economy faces 'extraordinary' range of outcomes, but nothing can stop America\n\nBuffett struck a cautious tone when discussing the U.S. economy at the start of the meeting, warning that the possibilities \"are still extraordinarily wide\" given the coronavirus crisis. But he then went on to reiterate his longtime belief that America will overcome even the most daunting challenges, including the current global pandemic. \"In 2008 and 2009 our economic train went off the tracks, and there were some reasons why the roadbed was weak in terms of the banks. This time we just pulled the train of the tracks and put it on a siding. And I don't really know of any parallel \u2014 in terms of a very, very well the most important country in the world, most productive, huge population \u2014 in effect sidelining its economy and its workforce.\" \"But even facing that, I would like to talk to you about the economic future of the country. Because I remain convinced, as I have -- I was convinced of this in World War II, I was convinced of it during the Cuban Missile Crisis, 9/11, the Financial Crisis -- that nothing can basically stop America.\" \u2014 Franck\n\n5:02 pm: Buffett says he owes a huge debt of gratitude to Dr. Fauci\n\nWarren Buffett thanked White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci for educating and informing him and the country of coronavirus developments, saying he owes a \"huge debt of gratitude\" to him. Buffett said the country is \"very, very fortunate\" to have Fauci who communicates in a \"very straightforward manner\" about the global health crisis. Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the leading public health expert on President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force. \u2014 Li\n\n4:45 pm: The meeting begins\n\nBuffett begins talking with Abel at another table to his side. Buffett has his beloved Coca-Cola next to him in a glass.\n\n4:45 pm: Greg Abel to take the stage with Warren Buffett\n\nAlongside Buffett on the stage answering shareholders' questions will be Greg Abel, Berkshire's vice chairman of non-insurance operations. Abel, who joined the conglomerate in 1992, was promoted to his post in 2018. Prior to that, he served as Berkshire Hathaway Energy's chairman and CEO. Abel, now 57, is seen as a top contender to succeed Buffett, who is 89 years old. At Berkshire's annual meeting last year, Buffett hinted that Abel and Ajit Jain, who handles all insurance-related operations, could be possible successors. Both Abel and Ajit answered some shareholder questions last year. \u2014 Li\n\n4:40 pm: Buffett has doubled the stock market's return\n\nDespite short-term fluctuations, Warren Buffett's long-term track record is why this meeting is such a big annual event for investors. Berkshire Hathaway A shares have returned nearly 21% annually since 1976, more than double the return of the S&P 500's 10% return over the same time, according to FactSet. Over the last year, Berkshire has lost 15%, compared to the S&P 500's 1% loss. Berkshire's heavy investments in banking and insurance has hurt it during this dramatic economic slowdown. \u2014 Melloy\n\n4:39 pm: What to expect from Berkshire's first virtual annual meeting\n\nThis year's Berkshire Hathaway shareholder's meeting, which will be held virtually for the first time, comes at a critical juncture for the conglomerate. Shareholders want more clarity on the company's leadership as Greg Abel shares the stage with Warren Buffett. They also want insight on Buffett's plans regarding the company's massive cash pile. Berkshire Hathaway has more than $137 billion in cash through the end of the first quarter and shareholders wonder if the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has found any attractive investments since the coronavirus pandemic sparked a global market sell-off. \u2014Imbert\n\n4:28 pm: Berkshire reports net loss of $50 billion\n\nBerkshire Hathaway reported a net loss of nearly $50 billion for the first quarter earlier Saturday as the conglomerate's stock investments took a massive hit amid the coronavirus outbreak. But this quarterly result is deceiving as Berkshire owns more stock investments than other companies that fluctuate. Accounting rules require the company to report unrealized losses in equities, so this loss is a reflection of the coronavirus stock market rout. Berkshire's operating earnings actually rose to $5.9 billion from $5.6 billion in the same period a year ago. \u2014 Imbert\n\n4:00 pm: Buffett hunkering down?", "author": ["Fred Imbert Yun Li Thomas Franck", "Fred Imbert", "Yun Li", "Thomas Franck"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/03/how-to-put-the-american-economy-back-together-after-coronavirus.html", "published": "2020-05-03T13:24:21", "title": "Putting the economy back together again: What the future holds for Americans", "text": "A stylist wearing a protective mask cuts a customer's hair at a barbershop in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday, April 27, 2020. Dustin Chambers | Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhen the coronavirus crisis, or at least the worst of it, passes, the U.S. economy will still be big \u2014 the biggest in the world, with any threat to be overtaken likely put at bay for many years. But in other ways, things will feel smaller, much smaller in fact. Growth rates will be lower. Big crowds will be few. Profit margins will be tighter. Life will continue in many regards, but nothing will be the same, not for a long time. Much of what will become routine daily life will go against instinct. Society will reach for ways to continue churning forward. But that will come with a mind not to repeat the trauma wrought by seven weeks of social distancing that has separated this connected world in ways that few ever thought possible. \"There will be lower densities of people everywhere,\" said Nick Colas, a Wall Street veteran and co-founder of DataTrek Research. \"That affects restaurants and bars and sports and everything.\" The size of the world and the magnitude of the task will be important as policymakers try to piece together a broken economy. Layoffs have soared as thriving businesses have been shuttered indefinitely. Manufacturing is in a steep recession, retail and restaurants could take years to get back to normal, and governments will be hamstrung in trying to provide basic services. As the world indeed is apt to feel smaller, it will require big ideas to get the U.S. moving again.\n\n'We're social animals'\n\nWhile formulating investment strategies and market analysis, Colas spends a lot of time studying sociological trends \u2014 how behavioral patterns impact what we do with our money and how we view our lives. One day he might be writing about thought exercises using game theory, the next examining, as he did in a recent daily note, how long specifically it takes people to develop new habits \u2014 66 days, it seems, a number useful when considering the current lockdown. Looking at the present social distancing situation, Colas figures on some key trends developing. He expects a faster return to domestic travel than might be apparent. Restaurants and retail will grapple with a host of challenges, like how to arrange seating and what happens in clothing stores when customers want to try on something. Sports will continue, but with fans mostly watching from home. All of it will come against a backdrop that will force people to keep a safe space from each other, something profoundly counterintuitive to a culture ingrained with hugs, handshakes and kisses. \"It's very hard, because it goes against the most fundamental human need of social contact. We're social animals,\" Colas said. \"This current phase already has been hard on people, particularly in areas like New York where a lot of single people live alone. They're going to want to have contact. That's human nature, that's the human spirit. It's going to be hard to tamp that down without mental health disruptions.\"\n\nBaby steps\n\nRegions of the country are taking the first steps, albeit gingerly, back to normalization. New York is reopening parts of the state, while Mississippi also has loosened restrictions. Idaho is transitioning into the first phase of relaxing its stay-at-home order. Arizona and Nevada have extended their directives to May 15 but relaxed some rules. You can now play golf in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but most of the Keystone State remains closed. Some resorts around the country are taking reservations for June. Reopened areas will serve as fishbowls for others looking to relax restrictions. More than that, they will provide a window into how quickly the $21.5 trillion U.S. economy can get back on its feet. Gross domestic product contracted 4.8% in the first quarter of 2020, the worst decline since the Great Recession, and more than 30 million people have filed unemployment claims, making the progress toward normalization all the more important \u2014 and urgent. \"The issue's going to be, can you get people feeling like the new normal feels like the old normal?\" Colas said. \"It should end up feeling a whole lot better, because some of your normal life is back. You can at least hang out with your friends in the backyard while maintaining social distance. But at least people are coming over again.\" How that translates into economic activity, though, remains uncertain.\n\nThe shape of the future\n\nEconomists have been pondering the shape of the recovery: Will it be a U? V? W? Check mark? Square root? Nike swoosh? No one seems to know, though the immediate expectations are that after the first-quarter slip the second quarter will post a number worse than anything the U.S. has seen before. In fact, the GDP number may be so bad \u2014 something on the order of a 20% collapse or even worse \u2014 and the unemployment rate peak \u2014 anything from 15% to 30% seems perfectly likely \u2014 as to become meaningless. What will matter more is the path forward. Most economists expect a considerable rebound after the second quarter. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he sees \"a fairly large increase given the size of the fall,\" thought \"it's unlikely it would be bring us quickly back to pre-crisis level. \" That's all theory, though. As a practical matter, the country just has to get moving again. \"The point estimate of GDP right now is not really that valuable,\" said Marin Gjaja, a partner with Boston Consulting Group, which is helping businesses come up with strategies for reopening and how to conduct business in an altered landscape. \"The variation by sector is enormous,\" he added. \"You've already seen what this has done to airlines, cruise ships, amusement parks, concert venues, amusement parks, any place where there are large amounts of people involved. They're trying to figure out how they can come back, what they can do to change their business in order to survive.\" Gjaja also sees a landscape dominated by smaller social gatherings. At a business level, that means shopping and eating closer to home. That benefits small retailers and locally focused restaurants but still leaves into question community-based businesses like barber shops and movie theaters. \"We've never seen a recession impact that looked like this with this degree of volatility in terms of impact by sector and geography,\" Gjaja said. \"The degree of variability is really unique. We're going to have to figure out a way to navigate through that.\" Boston Consulting released a report called \"COVID-19: Win the Fight, Win the Future\" that outlines what businesses need to do. Gjaja stressed that different locales will have different needs. New York won't be the same as Montana which won't be the same as Michigan. Certain general rules, though, will apply. Among the contingencies businesses need to take into account before opening are safety for employees and customers, preparation for additional shutdowns, and health monitoring for workers once they do return, he said.\n\nTraveling forward\n\nFor the travel industry, such questions are paramount. The World Travel and Tourism Council, which represents the industry perhaps most impacted by the coronavirus lockdown, is advocating for a global set of rules to follow in airports, hotels and on planes. \"These must provide the reassurance travelers and authorities need, using new technology, to offer hassle-free, pre-vaccine 'new normal' travel in the short term,\" said Gloria Guevara, the council's president and CEO. Guevara sees the liftoff in travel starting with something approaching \"staycations\" with trips near home, but then being led by younger people who can take advantage of lower fares to move about the country. According to the WTTC, some of the changes travelers are likely to see at hotels will include digital check-ins, hand sanitizers in plentiful supply and contactless payments rather than cash. Cruise line workers will wear gloves and the ships themselves will be cleaned more frequently. At airports, flyers will be tested when boarding and exiting, and likely will have to wear masks while on board. Companies that fail to follow safety guidelines may have to pay a steep price just in terms of business lost. A survey from Vital Vio, a New York-based biotech company, found that 51% of people won't do business with companies that don't show a commitment to being sanitary, while 76% said they will \"hold brands accountable\" that don't invest in cleaning up their spaces. Respondents also said they are willing to pay more for cleaner and safer travel as well as activities like dining out and going to the gym. All of the measures will combine to tell what kind of a recovery the U.S. has after what could well be the worst downturn in its history.\n\nWho will be first?", "author": ["Jeff Cox"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/03/rocket-lab-ceo-space-industry-in-coronavirus-slog.html", "published": "2020-05-03T15:18:42", "title": "Rocket Lab CEO: The space industry is entering at least 'a year and a half slog' due to coronavirus", "text": "Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck stands with one his company's Electron rockets. Rocket Lab\n\nMany companies in the space industry have seen operations grind to a crawl in the past two months because of the coronavirus crisis, a problem compounded by frozen venture capital that used to be readily available. Worse, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck told CNBC that this is only the \"early days\" of the crisis for an industry that saw a boom time over the past decade. While he remains hopeful that some creative and well-funded companies may continue pushing forward, Beck warned that this \"is going to be a really challenging time.\" \"This is a year-and-a-half slog, maybe even longer,\" Beck said. Beck is one of the most experienced leaders among the latest generation of space ventures, having built Rocket Lab into a multifaceted company. Begun in 2006, the company is backed by a host a VC firms and, in recent years, has grown its valuation to more than $1.2 billion. It's based in Long Beach, California but was founded by Beck in New Zealand. Rocket Lab has launched its Electron rocket to space 11 times from its New Zealand launchpad, since first reaching orbit in January 2018, and is closing in on the first mission from its second launchpad in Virginia later this year. Additionally, the company last year expanded into the spacecraft building business itself with its Photon satellite platform. Last week, it closed its acquisition of Canadian space systems company Sinclair Interplanetary, which builds satellite hardware. To top it all off, Rocket Lab recently passed key milestones in developing a system to reuse its rockets \u2014 by snagging them out of the sky using parachutes and a helicopter.\n\nAn Electron rocket lifts off from the company's launchpad in New Zealand.

He said VCs are not looking to invest in any companies that are \"pre-revenue\" for at least a year. After talking to Rocket Lab's investors, the general consensus for Beck was that it will take VC firms \"a very, very long time to return to the space industry.\" For context, the first quarter of 2020 alone saw $5.4 billion of equity investment in U.S. space companies. \"If you don't have revenue and you don't have at least 12 to 18 months of runway, it's a scary place to be,\" Beck said. \"Things are going to fail ... and it's going to be tough.\" Beck reflected on his first time raising capital in Silicon Valley. In essence, VC investment in space companies has gone through three phases: Little investment before 2009, an explosion of growth for nearly a decade, and then today's chilled environment. \"It was a totally different environment, none of them were into space at all,\" Beck said. \"I was the crazy guy wanting to build a launch vehicle, trying to raise $5 million.\"\n\nTop 25 VC-backed space companies \u2014 Quilty Analytics Company Total equity raised (millions) Time since last round (months) Revenue generation SpaceX $3,896 1 Yes Planet $444 16 Yes Rocket Lab $257 17 Some Spaceflight $253 5 Some Mapbox $229 30 Yes Tarana $204 2 Some Kymeta $197 37 Yes Relativity $185 6 No Spire $178 7 Yes Astroscale $149 12 No Orbital Insight $129 5 Yes Skylo Tech $116 3 No Kineis $111 2 No Satellogic $110 4 Some AST & Science $110 1 No Astranis $104 2 No Synspective $100 9 No Astra $100 N/A No Hawkeye 360 $99 8 Some Ispace $95 26 No Capella $80 5 No Spinlaunch $78 3 No Reaction Engines $68 24 No ICEYE $65 16 Some Descartes Labs $58 6 Yes\n\nWith investment in pre-IPO space companies cooled off, Beck believes those on the hunt for capital should consider banding together to survive. \"If you're one of these space companies that doesn't have a big runway and a product, perhaps it's time to think about consolidation,\" Beck said. \"Who are the partners that I can leverage with my particular piece of technology and join forces, rather than go completely extinct? \"I'm hopeful that this is not a time of just waste laying,\" he added. \"I'm hopeful that this is a time of consolidation, where these amazing teams and amazing technologies get absorbed under different umbrellas, rather than disband and the technologies go to the graveyard.\n\nGetting government stimulus to 'the highest node'\n\nBoth civil and military agencies are already stepping up funding for corporate space partners. NASA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Defense Innovation Unit are a few government agencies that are accelerating funding to space companies during the crisis. While Beck acknowledged that he doesn't \"have the golden solution\" for how government can further aid the space economy, he said the industry has \"to start talking about it to try and figure a way through.\" \"As the government, you're in a really tricky spot, because which ones do you save and which ones do you not?\" Beck asked. \"I see so much stimulus talk and it really worries me.\" He fears the disappearance of space capabilities provided by companies to the U.S., as well as funding being distributed ineffectively. \"Don't just do stuff for the sake of doing stuff and keeping an industry alive. Do things that do that but at the same time build capabilities that we've never had before,\" Beck said. \"Ultimately, this is an opportunity for nation building.\" Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's acquisitions leader, said last month that companies building small rockets \u2014 like Rocket Lab's Electron \u2014 are among the most impacted by the crisis. But Beck doesn't think the defense department should be prioritizing funds for small rocket builders, and not because it might bring new competition to his company. \"You could pour a whole lot of money into a number of other small launch companies and bring them to market. But my argument is that if there's nothing to be launched then everybody's standing around,\" Beck said. \"If you start down at the bottom somewhere, like small launch, it's pointless if your satellite industrial base is dead.\"\n\nRocket Lab engineers prepare a \"kick stage\" with several payloads attached before a mission. Rocket Lab\n\nBeck thinks any government stimulus for space should go \"to the highest node,\" with funds prioritized for spacecraft. Rocket Lab, its competitors and its supply chain \"will be healthy as long as there are spacecraft to build,\" he said. \"Then everybody's happy.\" He believes prioritizing funds for spacecraft should be based upon the question: \"What are things that have really good benefits for the country?\" \"When I think of America as a nation, I look to the things that have really disproportionate economic outcomes. One of the good examples is the GPS constellation \u2014 the cost of the constellation has a massively disproportionate benefit both for wealth and the economy,\" Beck said. While demand for space services may be resilient, as companies are largely business-to-business or business-to-government models, Beck believes the industry's supply chain \"is very fragile.\" He noted Rocket Lab's acquisition of Sinclair Interplanetary, saying it gave \"insight into a number of programs.\" \"The Sinclair acquisition for us was born out of the fact that the supply chain for those components is incredibly fragile. It helped secure a supply chain of critical parts,\" Beck said. As an example of which technologies he thought the government should prioritize, Beck pointed to companies building synthetic aperture radar satellites. It's a technology that has seen some applications already, such as analyzing oil storage from space, even though a SAR company has yet to complete a constellation of the satellites. \"SAR has great military utility but no one has really brought commercial SAR to the market. There's a number of international efforts going on and I think that's an area that the U.S. should remain leaders,\" Beck said. Beyond SAR, Beck said he will \"always be encouraging investment into sciences.\" \"Here's an opportunity to build some spacecraft to explore other planets and other worlds in the universe. If it's done well, the outcome has the ability to be totally disproportionate to the investment,\" Beck said.\n\nPublic market demand for space companies\n\nBeck also highlighted last year's public market debut by Virgin Galactic, which notably happened before this unprecedented pandemic began. The space tourism company's stock has been a favorite among speculative traders, especially in the final few months of the bull market earlier this year. But Beck said Virgin Galactic going public was \"a really interesting thermometer\" that showed how much investor interest exists for space assets. \"You gotta hand it to Richard Branson, that was a masterful piece of finance,\" Beck said.\n\nVirgin Galactic's spacecraft Unity fires its rocket engine and heads to space on Feb. 22, 2019.

The S&P 500 fell as much as 35% from a record reached Feb. 19 to a March 23 low. Since then, the broader market index has retraced more than half of those losses.\n\nBuffett has used previous price drops to buy companies at a discount or take partial ownership of companies.

I mean you could come to me on Monday morning with something that involved $30, or $40 billion or $50 billion. And if we really like what we are seeing, we would do it,\" said Buffett.

His next energy bet could pay off through a takeover or a rebound in oil prices.\n\nActivist Commentary: Carl Icahn has extensive experience in successful investing in the energy sector. He has had recent activist campaigns at Sandridge , Energen and Occidental Petroleum and had previously ousted Michael Talbert, the chairman of Transocean Ltd ., the world's largest drilling contractor, when one of Icahn's employees was given a board seat by shareholders. Prior to that, another Icahn employee received a board seat at oil and gas company Chesapeake Energy Corp. leading to the ouster of its chairman/CEO Aubrey McClendon. Also in 2012, he spent $2.6 billion to acquire 80% of oil and gas refiner CVR Energy . However, his experience in this industry goes back much further. Icahn acquired National Energy Group, TransTexas Gas and Panaco in 2005 for $625 million, cleaned them up and sold them seventeen months later for $1.6 billion.\n\nIcahn believes that the Company could be a synergistic acquisition opportunity for CVR Energy's petroleum segment that he owns and intends to seek to have discussions with the company regarding potential transactions involving the company and CVR Energy.\n\nWhile many of Icahn's energy investments have not done so well as the price of oil imploded, the investor often hedges out the oil risk so his returns on these investments may not be what they appear to be.\n\nIcahn is universally considered to be one of the best investors and shareholder activists. He has made billions of dollars for shareholders from his activist campaigns. However, he is also an investor and not everything he does is activism. Moreover, just because he files a 13D, it does not make it an activist situation.\n\nThis is a situation of Icahn acting as an investor, and not as a shareholder activist. He is openly trying to buy the company, so his interests are somewhat counter to other shareholders not aligned with them. There is nothing wrong with that, but this situation should not be confused with the many campaigns he launches on behalf of shareholders. While he is interested in buying the company at the best price, that does not mean that any deal would not be fair to shareholders. If the board and other large shareholders do their jobs right and ultimately decide to sell to Icahn, this could be good for everyone.\n\nIcahn has a history of being transparent in these situations and going the extra mile to be fair to shareholders. When he acquired CVR Energy, to assuage shareholder concerns that he was just going to flip it, he offered CVR's existing shareholders $30 a share, plus a \"contingent cash payment agreement,\" which gave shareholders the right to any amount over $30 a share if Icahn flipped CVR to another buyer within nine months.\n\nAt the Ira Sohn conference that year, John Paulson commented on the structure, saying \"CVR Energy is a gift from Carl Icahn. Carl is generally particularly friendly to shareholders.\"\n\nIcahn is also one of the best cyclical investors in history and may also be viewing this as an opportunity to buy good assets at a great part of the cycle. He acquired his position in March of this year when oil was close to its historical lows, and he got in for an average price of $13.09 per share.\n\nWith the stock now at $23.34 per share, Icahn's interest in acquiring the company could be waning; and this could end up being just another well-timed, successful investment for Icahn.\n\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio Manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.", "author": ["Kenneth Squire"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/heres-what-to-expect-from-warren-buffett-during-berkshire-hathaways-first-virtual-annual-meeting.html", "published": "2020-05-02T13:57:58", "title": "Here's what to expect from Warren Buffett during Berkshire Hathaway's first virtual annual meeting", "text": "\"Cash is not paying anything right now, so it behooves to take some of this capital and deploy it,\" said Greg Womack, president of Womack Investment Advisers, which owns Berkshire stock.\n\nThis year's meeting comes at a critical juncture for Berkshire. Shareholders want clarity about Berkshire's leadership moving forward and with its massive cash pile, many owners are wondering whether the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has found some attractive investments amid the pandemic plunge in stocks.\n\nThe meeting will be held Saturday but, unlike previous years, there won't be a crowd of shareholders swarming leaders Chairman Warren Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger with questions. Instead, the meeting will be held virtually, the questions answered will have been previously submitted and Munger will not be there.\n\nThis year's Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting will be like no other as investors look for insight on how the conglomerate will move forward from the coronavirus pandemic and what its future holds.\n\nBerkshire was sitting on more than $120 billion in cash at the end of last year and built up that cash position further in the first quarter. Buffett said in his 2019 letter to shareholders he was looking to make an \"elephant-sized\" acquisition but noted that valuations were too high.\n\nIn 2020, however, the coronavirus outbreak sent stocks tumbling from record levels into a bear market, lowering valuations. The S&P 500 dropped more than 35% from its record high on Feb. 19 to a low reached March 23. The broader-market index, however, then rebounded by more than 28% from that low.\n\nBuffett has used declines like this to make moves in the past. During the 2008 financial crisis, Buffett made special investments in Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.\n\nBut Buffett has remained unusually quiet this time around.\n\nIt would appear, according to the company's first quarter results filed Saturday morning, that Buffett is just building up cash and not buying much stock. So it will be interesting to see what he says on the matter at the meeting.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Munger said Berkshire is being conservative during this pandemic.\n\n\"We're like the captain of a ship when the worst typhoon that's ever happened comes,\" Munger told the paper. \"We just want to get through the typhoon, and we'd rather come out of it with a whole lot of liquidity.\"\n\nBut Womack thinks some of that cash can be reinvested in some of Berkshire's existing holdings, given how much they have fallen. \"As far as looking at what they own and what value could be out there, financials are a big area,\" he said.\n\nBank of America shares are down more than 30% year to date while Goldman Sachs has fallen 22%. Wells Fargo is down over 48% for 2020 and JPMorgan Chase has lost 33% of its value. American Express is down nearly 30% year to date.\n\nCathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, thinks it may be prudent for Berkshire to keep some \"dry powder\" given its large insurance and reinsurance businesses and the potential losses to those businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Berkshire is also an insurance company, and what we have is an insurance event right now,\" Seifert said. \"Berkshire also has a very big reinsurance business.\"\n\n\"Something that doesn't tend to be top of mind, but maybe should be, is what's their degree of exposure to the pandemic within the reinsurance business,\" Seifert said.\n\nInsurance losses from the coronavirus outbreak could range between $32 billion and $80 billion across some classes in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, according to broker Willis Towers Watson. That would surpass the claims total from the September 11 attacks.\n\nTo be sure, UBS analyst Brian Meredith thinks Berkshire's coronavirus risk is \"manageable.\"\n\nHe added that Berkshire's cash hoard \"and strong balance sheet will enable it weather the economic downturn better than most companies, in our view, and potentially afford it opportunities to utilize its cash to make acquisitions at attractive prices.\"", "author": ["Fred Imbert"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/nasas-bridenstine-investment-in-spacex-have-been-very-beneficial.html", "published": "2020-05-01T18:13:22", "title": "NASA's billions of investment in SpaceX have been 'very beneficial,' agency chief says", "text": "NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, left, and SpaceX Chief Engineer Elon Musk, right, speak to press in front of the Crew Dragon that is being prepared for the Demo-2 mission.\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine believes the billions his agency has invested in Elon Musk's SpaceX have been well worth it as the company prepares to launch astronauts for the first time this month.\n\n\"The investments that we have made into SpaceX and the investment SpaceX has made in itself have really resulted in I think something that is going to be very beneficial, not just for human space exploration, but beneficial for the economy,\" Bridenstine said during a press conference on Friday.\n\nNASA has awarded SpaceX with several contracts over the past two decades, ranging from development of new spacecraft to transporting cargo to the International Space Station.

Source: Goldman Sachs\n\nEach weekday morning, Moran Forman wakes up in her Chelsea apartment, takes a few steps to a spare bedroom and powers up the full might of Goldman Sachs on a curved LCD screen. Forman, a 33-year old managing director who runs a team of seven traders dealing in equity index derivatives, says technology allows her to feel so connected to her coworkers and clients, she rarely misses being at Goldman's headquarters a few miles to the south. \"I could be anywhere in the United States right now, and my ability to communicate and manage my team would be similar,\" Forman said in a phone interview. \"It's been amazing to see how much productivity has potentially even gone up during this period while everybody's still separated.\" For decades, Wall Street has been a place rooted in vast physical rooms filled with tightly-packed rows of monitors, specialized phones called turrets and workstations operated (mostly) by men between the ages of 22 and 45. This culture survived every calamity, manmade and otherwise, to happen to institutional trading in the last 20 years: The shift to decimalization in stocks; the 9/11 attacks, the financial crisis, the rise of passive investing and Hurricane Sandy. But now, after the coronavirus pandemic forced traders to work from home, Wall Street has gone virtual, setting off a cultural shift that is only beginning to be understood. As weeks at home stretch into months and traders get habituated to new tech platforms to stay connected, it's likely that Wall Street \u2013 which never before allowed traders to operate away from the floor \u2013 will be permanently changed by the coronavirus, according to traders, bank executives and the CEOs of tech vendors used by banks.\n\nNew normal\n\nWorking from home is now routine for Forman, a rising star at Goldman who was 8 months pregnant when she spoke to CNBC. She leans on Symphony, a messaging platform for investment banks similar to Slack, to create chatrooms for internal teams and clients, and Zoom to host teleconference calls with Goldman traders and clients. On any given day, she has 50 chats open with hedge funds, asset managers and pensions seeking advice on the intricacies of placing huge trades, usually to hedge against losses or wager on volatility. With all these workplace tools at her disposal, including a Goldman-issued Cisco phone that records conversations and lets her reach contacts at the press of a button, Forman said the transition has been easier than she would've imagined. It doesn't matter that colleagues are spread around the country, working from homes in Atlanta and Florida, as well as Goldman offices in Jersey City and Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\n\"Before you would've walked across the trading floor to communicate, and you kind of assumed that everyone knew what was happening because there was this assumption of knowledge transference that happens on the floor,\" Forman said. \"You're now forced to be more systematic and efficient about communicating.\" While companies have been investing in digital tools like Symphony for the past few years to keep up with a younger workforce used to excellent consumer technology, it's only now, amid the pandemic, that they have become crucial, said Ying Cao, director of digital strategy for London-based investment bank Barclays \"People were using it before, but you also had face-to-face,\" Cao said. \"With a very distributed workspace, it's important to have a group of people in a single chat room who can see each other typing and share information in real time, rather than sending an email and you don't know when that person will reply.\" The implications for remote work will be lasting, Cao said: \"Once you are at home and you realize it's so easy to conduct business, you don't want to commute two hours a day just to have conversations with people.\" Exhibit A for how the new Wall Street is operating is the industry's first-quarter results. Banks sent traders home in the second week of March as the pandemic was wreaking havoc, causing a historic surge in stock volatility and dislocations across credit markets. IT departments worked around the clock to equip thousands of traders for the task. But the five biggest U.S. investment banks posted their best trading quarter in nearly a decade as both bond and stock desks handily beat expectations. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman marveled at the results, which coincided with ten of the highest-volume days for stocks on record. \"If you told me three months ago we could have 90% of employees out of the office and be functioning with the volumes we have had,\" Gorman said in an CNBC interview, \"I would've said the probability of that being pulled off is close to zero, but it happened.\"\n\nReopening Wall Street\n\nNow, as the discussion turns to when New York \u2014 the global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic seeing a decline in coronavirus deaths in recent weeks \u2014 can begin to reopen, banks are beginning to plan for the return of workers. It won't be business as usual. Banks could bring back up to half of their staff, but doing more than that will be hard as employees still need to maintain distance from each other. Firms including Morgan Stanley are looking at keeping workers masked and leaving every other seat empty, and have even considered setting up plastic partitions between desks. Goldman is looking at installing infrared body scanners at building entrances, and banks including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are figuring out how to keep lobbies and elevators from becoming focal points of contagion. \"Some portion of our workforce won't need to come back to the office on a full-time basis anymore,\" said Bob Santella, CEO of IPC Systems, the leading maker of trading turrets for Wall Street. \"There will be pressure to space people further at the office, and my expectation is that's going to be offset by a larger percentage of people working from home that weren't doing it.\" This intermediate period could last 12 months or longer, Santella said, meaning that people will continue to rely on tech platforms rather than face-to-face contact. Since the coronavirus pandemic took hold, IPC has sold more than 10,000 licenses for \"soft turrets\" \u2013 cloud based telephones for remote work \u2013 or six to seven times more than in the past year.\n\nDavid Gurle, CEO, Symphony Source: Symphony\n\n\"People have become dependent on Symphony for their daily activities,\" Symphony CEO David Gurle said in interview. \"It's an essential element of their business going forward because they don't think this is a one-off event, they realize that pandemics could be the new reality.\" The Palo Alto, California-based start-up said that from January to March, message traffic on the network jumped 273% while daily active users rose 42%. The story is similar for hedge funds, which have been using Microsoft Teams and Skype, according to Chris Grandi, CEO of Abacus Group. His IT firm serves over 500 hedge funds with a combined $750 billion in assets under management. Even more than banks, hedge funds are likely to adopt a post-coronavirus model where workers don't need to be physically present, he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're a New York hedge fund or a Dallas hedge fund or a hedge fund in Minnesota, nobody's working from the office anymore,\" Grandi said.\n\nEssential workers", "author": ["Hugh Son"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/the-markets-comeback-hinges-on-the-economy-reopening-without-any-major-setbacks.html", "published": "2020-05-01T12:43:45", "title": "Market's comeback hinges on the economy reopening without major setbacks", "text": "April's 12% rally in the S&P 500 has been based largely on hopes for a reopening of the U.S. economy, but if you want to know how fragile the restart may be, try talking to veteran restaurant owner Peter Dissin.\n\nDissin is the owner of Pinefish, a well-regarded restaurant in Center City Philadelphia, which is currently closed.

This permeates not only the sidewalks and grocery stores, but also the media . Each interview of a shop owner in Georgia or state governor considering re-opening spurs multiple \"Do you really think that's safe?\" questions.\n\nI was biking up a big hill in Boston on a recent Sunday morning, an activity I've resorted to now that I can't play tennis or go to spinning class. I was huffing and puffing, so I pulled down my face mask, which is required outdoor attire in my town. I noticed a runner coming downhill on the other side of the wide four-lane street we were sharing. She lifted her hand and then pointed at me, screaming that I needed to pull my face mask up over my nose. Since we were about 50 feet apart, I would never have heard her if not for the decibel level.\n\nIn only five weeks, the S&P has climbed more than 30%, to just 15% below its all-time peak. The market has advanced so fast, during the plight of the pandemic, that it almost seems blasphemous to be bullish. If the moral position is to Covid-shame anyone whose mask is pulled down while biking uphill, how could anyone publicly embrace a rising S&P that ignores increasing deaths, particularly in the home state of Wall Street; unfathomable unemployment; massive business failures; a possible 40% to 50% drop in the nation's gross domestic product this quarter; and huge federal deficits?\n\nNevertheless, the market shook off warnings of policymakers and pundits who are certain that reopening should be both glacial in timing and conditional on universal testing or an effective vaccine \u2014 which are both many months, if not years, away. Stocks have steadily scaled a wall of not just worry, but intense fear of insensitivity to the suffering around us. The implication is that investors believe that the wall was too high and the market was too pessimistic in late March.\n\nThe buyers have been challenging the analysis of every news network epidemiologist and hospital chief of staff as they bet that the worst is behind us. If it is sacrilegious to argue publicly that six weeks of social isolation, stuck in your house with the same few people, should dramatically lower the risk of getting or giving the infection, one alternative is to quietly place buy orders for equities. Likewise, trillions of funding for struggling businesses, consumers, and borrowers is enormously comforting.\n\nLast weekend, Brett Stephens of the New York Times penned a piece with which I agree, sheepishly, of course, suggesting that the entire country should not be on the same re-opening schedule as its hardest-hit state, New York. Westchester County has 1.6 times the deaths as Texas, which has thirty times the population.\n\nOthers of us, who work in a profession often accused of heartlessness, may feel less empowered to be outspoken. It seems particularly callous to defend the market's sharp upward slope as a reflection of curve flattening, while the numbers of people dying continues to rise.\n\nIf we examine the mortality data from my state of Massachusetts, we see that 86% were patients over age 70, 98% had underlying conditions, and only 1% were under the age of 50. None of this makes me feel good, but it suggests that focusing resources on the at-risk groups, rather than all populations equally, is logical. The stock market may have understood these numbers weeks ago.\n\nA day of reckoning will arrive when results need to back up the market's optimism.

While two weeks ago more people thought that the UK had done better than Italy and Spain, now the reverse is the case.\n\nThe findings come after a week in which the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the UK had the highest total of deaths from Covid-19 of any European nation.\n\nThe ONS said 29,648 deaths had been registered in England and Wales with Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate by 2 May.

They were wrong. Grinning, the officer encouraged them to enjoy the sun and suggested that if the park became too crowded they should consider leaving.\n\nFor people sunning themselves in London Fields, Hackney, the incident signified another unheralded shift in the UK\u2019s coronavirus lockdown strategy. \u201cTwo days ago, police were confiscating beer from drinkers\u2019 hands,\u201d said media consultant Gavin Jamieson, 34. \u201cWeeks before that, they were turning up in vans and telling people to leave the park.\u201d\n\nIt was obvious, added his friend Adrian Wilson, 37, that the Metropolitan police had finally abandoned the government\u2019s emergency lockdown measures as unenforceable.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a clear disconnect between the police and the government,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cBoris Johnson has completely muddied the water on what we\u2019re all meant to be doing.\u201d\n\nFurther south on Hackney\u2019s Broadway Market, further confusion reigned \u2013 just 17 hours before Johnson was scheduled to outline his \u201croadmap\u201d for ending coronavirus restrictions. Aurelie Legrand, 22, a physiotherapist from France, said: \u201cThere are so many competing messages that people have decided for themselves that the lockdown has ended.\u201d Gesturing to the passing throng, she said: \u201cLook around you!\u201d\n\nPeople have a need to be extrovert, to be sexy, to socialise Martin Adams, startup founder\n\nOn the pavement, red lines outside shops attempted to enforce social distancing for those queueing. By 10am, at least 15 couples were in a carefully spaced line outside a butchers.\n\nAn hour later, the temperature had nudged into the 20s. The crowd grew. Garfield Bascombe surveyed the scene with a wan smile. The 55-year-old is Broadway Market\u2019s inaugural social distancing inspector. It is his duty to ensure lockdown measures are obeyed in one of the busiest streets in a London borough with the third-highest coronavirus death rate in England and Wales.\n\nYet Bascombe estimated he only had to intervene a handful of times each day, despite the thousands moving through the thoroughfare.\n\n\u201cSo far so good. Most people are listening to the advice of the government. People have got the message: keep your distance!\u201d\n\nSome, though, admitted they had no clue what the message was. Government sources last week raised the prospect of picnics with pals and sunbathing in the park ahead of the hot bank holiday weekend. The briefings induced newspaper headlines declaring \u201cLockdown freedom\u201d \u2013 and equally rapid counter-briefings that the easing of restrictions would be minimal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elaine and Alex Hanna in London Fields on Saturday. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer\n\n\u201cI just hope the new messaging is a lot clearer: their approach does undermine my confidence,\u201d said lecturer and artist Alex Hanna, 56. His graphic designer wife, Elaine, 52, was more abrupt. \u201cIt feels like they are making it up as they go along,\u201d she said.\n\nNearby, clutching a takeaway coffee, Georgina Davies, 26, an interior designer from Byron Bay in Australia, wondered at the furtiveness surrounding public health guidance. \u201cThey are a bit tight-lipped on what exactly people should be doing.\u201d\n\nThe ambiguity was articulated by the rarity of face masks among the visitors to London Fields. Johnson has admitted that scientists think masks might help stop the spread of coronavirus, but there has been no change to government advice that they are not required outside medical and care settings.\n\nOne frequent wearer was 30-year-old care worker Gevon Beckford, who said that although his peers were complying with the lockdown, restlessness was building. \u201cSome are getting a bit frustrated. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty.\u201d Beckford has made 15 home visits a day for six days a week since the start of the pandemic and appreciates that his job carries danger. When told that official figures last week revealed that black people were four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people, he exhaled sharply: \u201cWhoa, I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, others sensed that the government\u2019s messaging has been too weak, given what they should know about human nature. \u201cPeople have a need to be extrovert, to be sexy, to socialise, and these are taking precedence over safety,\u201d said Martin Adams from Essex.\n\nThe 34-year-old artificial intelligence startup founder also questioned the assertion that, in a borough where only 15% are aged over 55, it was largely young people who are breaching coronavirus measures. \u201cI\u2019ve seen older couples in their 40s and 50s meeting obviously for the first time on park benches,\u201d said Adams.\n\nAway from Hackney, evidence of lockdown fatigue has emerged across the UK. The Coastguard reported the highest number of call-outs since lockdown began, evidence that people had started to ignore the stay-at-home message.\n\nIn Manchester, tensions were running high after dozens of people were pictured sitting together soaking up the sun outside a bar. At Heaton Park in the north of the city, officials were pictured trying to stop visitors having picnics and barbecues.\n\nIn Cornwall and Devon, where traffic has been steadily building, police \u201cencouraged\u201d residents and visitors who have concerns about gatherings to immediately contact them.\n\nBack on Broadway Market, as the afternoon temperature climbed on Britain\u2019s seventh lockdown weekend, the Dove pub began serving takeaway alcoholic drinks in an initiative that Hackney\u2019s mayor has branded \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\nJamieson disagreed. \u201cPeople need to congregate, to express themselves. Sometimes they need to live for today.\u201d\n\nThe science behind the lockdown rules\n\nThe government\u2019s rules for protection against Covid-19 are based on a series of assumptions about the virus that causes the disease. In the few months that this virus has been known to science, these are the rules that have been devised, writes Robin McKie.\n\nKeeping two metres apart: This distance is based on the fact that droplets coughed out by a human being will travel no more than two metres before falling to the ground. It is assumed that virus-laden droplets are a key method of the airborne transmission of the disease. However, smaller aerosols may be responsible for spreading some virus particles, though it is not yet clear if they carry enough to trigger an infection in another person. Tests to find out are now under way in laboratories.\n\nFace masks: The non-specialist face masks on sale in the UK are generally not designed to protect the person wearing them but to protect others. \u201cThey are designed to catch what you breathe out, not what you breathe in,\u201d says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. \u201cThe worry is that people will wear them thinking they cannot be infected, and will not feel they have to take other precautions.\u201d\n\nIt is safer outside: \u201cImagine setting fire to a newspaper inside your flat,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThe smoke will hang around for hours. Do it in the open air and the smoke will be wafted high into the air in minutes. And so it will be for virus-carrying droplets hanging in the air. They will dissipate very quickly outdoors and very slowly indoors.\u201d\n\nThe 15-minute rule: According to Public Health England, a quarter of an hour is the maximum time you should spend in conversation with someone you\u2019re not sharing lockdown with. This is based on observations of the behaviour of other airborne microbes. These indicate that 15 minutes is the average time you can spend in safe conversation without breathing in virus-laden droplets.\n\nWashing your hands: The evidence is very clear. The virus that causes Covid-19 has a coat covered with chemicals called lipids, and these are rapidly made inactive by soap and water. \u201cBy washing your hands carefully as often as possible, you can halt the spread of the virus which you can pick up when touching infected surfaces. It is as simple as that,\u201d says Finn.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "author": ["Mark Townsend"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/100-days-later-how-did-britain-fail-so-badly-in-dealing-with-covid-19", "published": "2020-05-10T07:17:18", "title": "100 days later: How did Britain fail so badly in dealing with Covid-19?", "text": "Since the UK confirmed its first case, its response has proved one of the least effective\n\nIt is 100 days since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the UK on 31 January. The official death toll so far from the epidemic has topped 33,000 and is still rising fast. The actual total could be far higher, many analysts say \u2013 leaving Britain among the countries hit hardest by Covid-19.\n\nThe government has struggled to get on top of the crisis, facing growing criticism for its lack of early preparation to tackle the virus, its abrupt shifts in strategy, its failure to provide adequate protective equipment for its medical staff and other key workers, and its inability to organise testing on the scale that many say is vital.\n\nAnd its communications have been widely described as evasive and shambolic \u2013 with many left confused last week as the Cabinet battled to provide a coherent account of its plans to lift the lockdown.\n\nThose plans have been complicated by the fact that our infection rate remains stubbornly high and, as a result, any measures announced by Boris Johnson on Sunday are expected to be modest. While some other countries are embarking tentatively on a return to normality, Britain is struggling to meet its criteria for doing so.\n\nAmid a growing perception that the government\u2019s record in confronting the crisis is amongst the worst in the world, the Labour leader Keir Starmer confronted Boris Johnson this week in their first prime minister\u2019s questions meeting with the stark question: \u201cHow on earth did it come to this?\u201d\n\nBelow Robin McKie, Toby Helm and Emma Graham-Harrison try to answer that question by considering the key factors that might lie behind our disaster.\n\nPolitics\n\nOver the past week there have been moments when members of the government have given up pretending that all has gone well. As evidence of the mishandling of the pandemic response has piled up, some ministers have realised they would sound ridiculous if they could not admit that errors had been made.\n\nOn Wednesday, James Brokenshire, a home office minister, accepted that more testing early on would have helped. \u201cThere is an acknowledgement mistakes have been made \u2013 no government is going to get everything right,\u201d he said. Then at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions the same day Boris Johnson admitted his \u201cbitter regret\u201d at the crisis in care homes. But they have been rare admissions.\n\nOver the last few days the UK\u2019s political leaders have been divided over the lockdown and how to keep the public safe. Mid-week, Downing Street was indicating it wanted to end the \u201cstay at home\u201d message while Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s First Minister, protested that to do so would risk many more lives. The issue was still being debated at the highest levels on Friday as No 10 appeared to be backing off such a change.\n\nNo one can expect politicians to handle a crisis on this scale without things going wrong along the way. Labour, under its new leader Keir Starmer, has acknowledged that. He held back in his criticism until last week, knowing that the country wanted this government to succeed. But he, too, would not have been doing his job had he not highlighted government failings in his first PMQ with Johnson. Why, he asked, had the government been slow on testing, slow on supplying PPE to NHS and care home workers, slow on going into lockdown?\n\nPlay Video 2:24 Keir Starmer confronts Boris Johnson in their first PMQs clash \u2013 video highlights\n\nWhen the inevitable public inquiry is held, Johnson\u2019s government will face hard questions about its response. When many UK scientists were growing increasingly worried about Covid-19 in January and February, Johnson and his team had other things on their minds \u2013 enjoying their general election win and \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d.\n\nJohnson inherited public services ill-equipped to handle a pandemic. The NHS lacked enough intensive care beds, protective equipment for staff and, initially, ventilators. The social care sector, shamefully unreformed, was another victim of Tory austerity that has paid the price. Anglo-Saxon economics has left the UK vulnerable, whereas countries which had spent more on their health systems \u2013 Germany is the prime example \u2013 have fared better.\n\nDecision-making has also been found wanting. The UK ended track-and-trace testing on 12 March, because there was not the capacity to carry on. A sense that the UK could somehow tough it out prevailed for too long.\n\nEarly on in the crisis Johnson missed a series of Cobra meetings about Covid-19 and was still proudly shaking hands with people in hospitals in early March. Now, as he tries to find ways to ease the lockdown, while at the same keeping the risk of a second wave to a minimum, the test for the government is to keep the public believing it has the answers. So far much of the evidence has suggested otherwise.\n\nToby Helm\n\nHistory\n\nBritain\u2019s pandemic planning was extensive \u2013 even if the government did not choose to implement lessons learned from its 2016 simulation, Exercise Cygnus \u2013 but the one thing it did not have was recent first-hand experience of a major respiratory disease outbreak.\n\nWhen Covid-19 arrived, it had been over a century since the Spanish flu swept through the country.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man wears a mask during the Spanish flu of 1918. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nDecades without an airborne epidemic of a new disease may have bred false confidence that viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which spread from China in 2002, and Ebola, which first appeared in Africa in the 1970s, could be contained near their place of outbreak.\n\nCountries that lived through those outbreaks first hand were among those that moved most swiftly and decisively against coronavirus, the tragic lessons of the past a spur to action.\n\nBefore Covid-19 had been identified as a coronavirus, and when it was still being described as a \u201cmystery pneumonia\u201d, Taiwan brought in checks on passengers flying from Wuhan. These soon expanded to over 120 measures including strict quarantine, border controls, testing and contact tracing.\n\n\u201cWe learned very harsh lessons from Sars and that experience is something other countries don\u2019t have,\u201d said Chan Chang-chuan, dean of National Taiwan University\u2019s College of Public Health. To date, its Covid-19 death toll is six, despite its very close economic and cultural ties with mainland China, and a high volume of cross-border travel between the two.\n\nSouth Korea endured Sars and has even more recent memories of a fatal coronavirus epidemic, after Mers (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) broke out there in 2015, killing 36 people. It began ramping up testing capacity from January, before the disease had arrived in force.\n\nAt one point the country had the highest number of cases outside mainland China, but its testing and careful contact tracing meant it was among the first and most successful countries in flattening the curve.\n\nExperience of Sars may have made governments more confident the public would accept restrictions, and that proved indeed to be the case: many people took proactive measures, such as covering their faces, even before authorities stepped in.\n\nAnd in Africa, experience of Ebola may have helped Sierra Leone keep cases to just 231 so far; authorities repurposed tracking systems set up in the wake of the 2014 outbreak.\n\nBut there are also countries that have not lived through recent outbreaks of respiratory epidemics that have responded fast and kept cases low, from New Zealand to Senegal and Denmark.\n\nSo while past experience may have helped some countries, it was not a necessary condition for a rapid and effective response and should not be seen as an explanation for why the UK has been so badly affected.\n\nEmma Graham-Harrison\n\nDemography\n\nAge clearly plays a key part in influencing the outcome of Covid-19 and is highlighted as a cause of some of the widespread variations seen in death tolls from different countries. Italy and Spain have relatively old populations and have suffered high death rates while nations such as Ireland, with lower median ages, have fared better. So could the UK\u2019s relatively elderly population explain our high death rates?\n\nNo, said Professor Sarah Harper, founding director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing.\n\n\u201cFrom a demographic point of view, the UK is no different from most other European countries. In fact, we are on the younger side, so you cannot blame the age structure of the UK for this.\u201d\n\nIn addition, care homes \u2013 claimed by some to be a special UK issue \u2013 have proved to be serious problems in other nations with substantial Covid-19 death rates, including France, Belgium and Norway. \u201cCare home outbreaks are almost inevitable without really radical measures to prevent them,\u201d said Professor Noel McCarthy, of Warwick Medical School.\n\nPlay Video 4:56 Why BAME people may be more at risk from coronavirus \u2013 video explainer\n\nScientists have also found that individuals from black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19 in Britain. About 13% of the UK population come from BAME backgrounds but they account for a third of virus patients in critical care units. Last week, figures for England and Wales suggested that black people were four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people.\n\nHowever, this picture is not unique to the UK. Nations that include Norway and the US have also reported high Covid-19 death rates among BAME people. Just why this is occurring remains unclear \u2013 though scientists point out that BAME groups tend to suffer from higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and obesity, conditions that make people more vulnerable to Covid-19.\n\nAnother key risk factor is obesity. Those with a body mass index greater than 30 are more likely to need intensive care than those with healthy weights. Britain is facing a major obesity problem, doctors have pointed out, and this could explain, in part, our high Covid-19 fatality rate of nearly 500 deaths per million people. Yet this picture is confounded by comparisons with other nations. For example, New Zealand has a worse prevalence of obesity than the UK but has a Covid-19 death rate of only 4 per million.\n\n\u201cTo be blunt, it was a lack of testing, a failure to shut down society in time, and a lack of care equipment that are to blame for current high Covid-19 death rates,\u201d said Harper.\n\nRobin McKie\n\nGeography\n\nBritain is a densely populated nation containing a very large capital city. More than 9 million people live in London and more than 18 million people arrived in the UK in the first three months of the year: a perfect nursery setting for a new virus to take seed and then increase in numbers in an explosive, exponential manner. Other densely populated places such as New York and northern Italy have also suffered.\n\nSo was the UK simply unfortunate? Has its population felt the impact of Covid-19 more deeply because of its geography?\n\nThe link is weak, say epidemiologists, who point to many other cramped, bustling cities that have relatively low numbers of Covid-19 cases at present. A good example is provided by India. It is the world\u2019s second most populous nation and its cities \u2013 including Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata, some of the biggest and most populous urban centres in the world \u2013 are renowned for their dense populations and tightly packed housing. Yet Covid-19 death rates are remarkably low there. Last week, the death rate from the disease stood at 1 per million people in India, it was reported. The UK\u2019s rate is reported at nearly 500 per million.\n\nAs a result, many UK scientists reject the idea that Britain\u2019s high death toll is simply a matter of unfortunate positioning or a result of the high density of much of its population. \u201cWere we unlucky? No. We just didn\u2019t have a proper plan for dealing with this. Other countries did,\u201d said virologist Professor Nicola Stonehouse, of Leeds University.\n\nThis point was backed by consultant cardiologist Amitava Banerjee. \u201cWe were not humble enough to look at other countries \u2013 China, Italy or Spain \u2013 and learn a lesson from them and lock down quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is as simple as that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were arrogant,\u201d added Banerjee, who is also assistant professor of clinical data science at University College London. \u201cWe thought we had nothing to learn from other countries and thought we were an exceptional case. In fact, we had a lot to learn but didn\u2019t take the opportunity.\u201d\n\nTaking lessons from past mistakes and from the examples of other nations will be crucial if Britain is to hope to extricate itself from the medical crisis it now faces, say epidemiologists.\n\nRobin McKie\n\nEndgame\n\nHow Britain extricates itself from its coronavirus lockdown will be a delicate procedure, scientists agree. In general, they envisage an approach that would maintain restrictions until numbers of Covid-19 cases are low enough to allow the tracking and isolating of individual cases.\n\nHowever, at the current rate of infections, it is hard to see when that might occur. Last week, the number of new cases of Covid-19 that were being diagnosed every day hovered around the 5,000 mark. That is far too high to allow tracing of newly infected individuals. The tracking system would be overwhelmed in days. The country therefore faces a choice. It could endure even harsher lockdown rules \u2013 with no exercise permitted \u2013 or maintain the current system for months. Alternatively, it could ease the lockdown in the near future and risk facing a rapidly rising second wave of cases.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A researcher in a lab developing a vaccine for Covid-19. Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhenever lockdown is relaxed, emphasis is likely to be placed on shielding the vulnerable, in particular those who have high risk factors, such as the elderly. They would be isolated and their visitors given daily tests to show if they had been exposed to the virus.\n\nHowever, this idea is questioned by Professor Sarah Harper of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing. \u201cIf you look at the mathematical models, you can see that if we remove the over-70s from everyday life we could slow down viral transmission and possibly stave off a second wave of Covid-19. But we would be doing something purely on the basis of age.\u201d And that, said Harper, could be seen as unfair.\n\n\u201cMathematical models are useful for describing different alternative scenarios but these then have to be considered in the light of societal acceptability by our policy-makers and politicians.\n\n\u201cOlder people are not the only ones vulnerable to Covid-19. Men are twice more likely to die of the disease than women, while people from BAME communities also have higher than average death rates. What if the modelling showed that removing all men from society for a longer time would have a similar effect? Would such a plan be acceptable? Probably not.\u201d\n\nA vaccine is a long-term hope but there may be other measures that decrease transmission that are available now, added Professor Noel McCarthy of Warwick Medical School. \u201cFor example, if public mask-wearing decreased spread by 20% it would reduce mortality by more than the whole of the lockdown to date \u2013 but we need real evidence, such as a large-scale trial, to give evidence to support this in the longer term.\u201d\n\nRobin McKie", "author": ["Robin Mckie", "Emma Graham-Harrison"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/will-covid-19-mutate-into-a-more-dangerous-virus", "published": "2020-05-10T08:48:30", "title": "Will Covid-19 mutate into a more dangerous virus?", "text": "As the coronavirus spreads around the world, there are concerns that it will mutate into a form that is more transmissible, more dangerous, or both, and potentially make the global health crisis even worse. What do we know about the way the virus is evolving?\n\nIs the virus mutating?\n\nAll viruses mutate and the Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus that causes Covid-19 is no exception. Mutations arise when the virus replicates inside cells and mistakes are made in copying its genetic code. Unlike humans, whose genes are written in double-stranded DNA, the coronavirus genes are carried on single-stranded RNA.\n\nHow fast is the virus mutating?\n\nThe coronavirus is actually quite stable. Scientists have analysed about 13,000 virus samples in Britain since mid-March and found that new mutations appear roughly twice per month. The rate of mutations is important because the faster a virus mutates, the quicker it changes behaviour. A fast-evolving virus can be harder to make vaccines against because by the time the vaccine has been developed, the parts of the virus the immune system attacks might have changed. Seasonal influenza mutates so rapidly we need a different vaccine each year.\n\nHow does coronavirus vary around the world?\n\nThe genetic code from coronaviruses around the globe show that it splits into groups as it spreads. There is nothing unusual about this. In April, researchers in Germany identified three main genetic groups of the virus they named A, B and C. Groups A and C are mostly found in Europeans and Americans, while group B is most common in East Asia. But there are smaller groups too, which scientists can use to trace infections back to their sources, and ultimately back to a region such as Wuhan or northern Italy.\n\nWhy do mutations matter?\n\nMutations happen by chance all the time. Most have little effect, and some hamper the virus, but over time, single or multiple mutations can potentially build up that make the virus more successful by allowing it to spread more easily. Mutations can also make the virus more dangerous, for example by making it more efficient at infecting cells.\n\nWhat mutations has the virus picked up?\n\nA number of mutations have caught scientists\u2019 attention. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine studied more than 5,000 coronavirus genomes from around the world and discovered several mutations that may be evidence of the virus adapting to humans. Two mutations are in the critical \u201cspike\u201d protein that the virus uses to invade cells.\n\nThe spike mutations are rare at the moment, but Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases and a senior author on the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, said their emergence highlights the need for global surveillance of the virus. That will reveal whether the new mutations help the virus to spread and whether vaccines may need to be redesigned to account for the mutations.\n\nIn another preliminary study, scientists at Sheffield University and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico found similar mutations in the spike protein which the authors claim may help the infection to spread. While that is possible, other scientists believe it is too early to know whether any of the mutations are helping the virus thrive.\n\nProf Nick Loman, at the University of Birmingham, said that all of the coronaviruses are very similar and that viruses with particular mutations can rise up in different areas for a range of reasons. A major factor is which virus gains a foothold first \u2013 the so-called founder effect \u2013 which may come down to one person\u2019s travel plans rather than any adaptation of the virus. \u201cFrom the point of view of people who are understandably concerned about this pandemic, I\u2019m sure it will not matter which mutations the virus has, it\u2019s not a good virus either way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look to see if any of the mutations change behaviour and we don\u2019t have any evidence for that.\u201d\n\nWhat else can mutations tell us?\n\nAs scientists learn more about the genetic makeup of coronaviruses, they will be able to use the information to trace an individual\u2019s infection to nearby clusters and ultimately back to its origin. That can be useful for tracing outbreaks and spotting newly imported infections. But intense monitoring will also flag up how the virus mutates and acquires resistance to and drugs and vaccines that are used in the future. \u201cAs those become available, we would expect to see functional mutations just like with see with antibiotic resistance in bacteria,\u201d Loman said.", "author": ["Ian Sample"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance", "published": "2020-05-10T05:35:01", "title": "Coronavirus latest: at a glance", "text": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:\n\nGlobal coronavirus cases pass 4 million\n\nGlobal coronavirus cases stand at 4,024,973, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker, with global deaths at 279,321.

Over the last two months, dozens of prospective tests have hit the market, and with many governments wanting to feed the results of large-scale testing into their decisions whether to end lockdowns, biological tests have rarely carried such weight.\n\nMost of the tests are enthusiastically marketed, boasting of their ability to accurately detect whether someone has previously been infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus.

Photograph: Barcroft Media via Getty Images\n\nThe aim of using antibody tests is to conduct what is known as serosurveillance or a serosurvey. This means testing a sample of a population to get an indication of how prevalent Covid-19 infections have been, including those who have been asymptomatic or only suffered mild symptoms.\n\nAntibody tests search for the Y-shaped proteins produced by the body in response to an infection that linger (in some cases permanently) in the blood for some time after recovery.\n\nPlay Video 5:58 Coronavirus tests: how they work and what they show\n\nThe hope is that policymakers will be able to obtain accurate models of how far the epidemic has spread, and what the real infection tallies are, a topic that has become increasingly heated in recent weeks. At the start of April, Bruce Aylward \u2013 the World Health Organization delegate assessing China\u2019s response to the outbreak \u2013 declared that there was no evidence that current infection statistics are only the \u201ctip of a grand iceberg\u201d and suggested that the virus had only affected a very small proportion of communities. He cited a study done in Guangdong province where 320,000 swab samples were retested for Covid-19, with less than 0.5% turning out to be positive.\n\nQ&A What does the 'R' number of coronavirus mean? Show Hide R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread. It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time. The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing; and a population\u2019s immunity. Hannah Devlin Science correspondent\n\nJay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, California, also detected a relatively low prevalence for Covid-19 after conducting antibody testing on 3,330 people in Santa Clara, one of the first serosurveys to be done. Bhattacharya estimated true rates of exposure of up to 4%, but his work has since been criticised by other scientists on various grounds, not least after it emerged that his wife had recruited some of the study participants by emailing a local high school.\n\nAre the differences in deaths between countries due to some populations having had greater exposure to similar viruses?\n\nOther early serosurveys conducted in New York City and the German town of Gangelt have found much higher prevalences ranging from 14-21%. However, these communities were particularly severely affected, so reservations have been expressed about whether they are representative of the entire population.\n\nAcquiring accurate antibody data will also be vital for vaccine developers to verify that their products are working as intended during clinical trials. Results from serosurveys will eventually help tell us whether exposure to Covid-19 provides immunity, or if we will face seasonal waves of infections. And intriguingly, they may assist in determining the importance of pre-existing immunity. Scientists have already wondered whether the differences in fatalities between various countries is due to certain populations having had greater exposure to similar viruses in the past.\n\nBut to gather truly reliable information, the antibody tests used must be shown to have a high degree of accuracy, something that has so far proven to be easier said than done.\n\nRigorous validation\n\nThe majority of current antibody tests target the spike protein. This is the sole protein on the viral surface responsible for entry into the host cell, and so the main part of the virus that elicits antibody responses. However, the amino acid structure of the spike protein has a 60% overlap with the four seasonal coronaviruses that circulate in humans. Targeting the wrong site on this protein means an antibody test is unable to distinguish between people who have had Covid-19 and those who have had the common cold.\n\nThe promise of an Oxford vaccine reveals how a new Britain could thrive | Will Hutton Read more\n\nScientists initially look at a test\u2019s specificity \u2013 the proportion of healthy people it correctly identifies as not having had the virus \u2013 using blood samples from healthy individuals collected before the start of the outbreak.\n\nFor a test to be usable, the specificity should be close to 100%. If, for example, 5% of the population have had Covid-19, a test with only 90% specificity would mistakenly assess 95 people in a sample of 1000 individuals as having had the virus, ie nearly 70% of the positive results would be false.\n\nIf a test\u2019s specificity is sufficient, scientists then begin to examine its sensitivity \u2013 the proportion of people it correctly identifies as having had Covid-19 in the past few months \u2013 steadily increasing the difficulty in the process. To thoroughly assess this, they use samples from people who had severe bouts of the disease, and then samples from those only mildly affected.\n\nBut such verifications take time, and with fears growing daily about the economic consequences of prolonging the lockdown, some countries have responded impatiently. The UK government would like the general public to conduct their own tests through fingerprick kits made available in their millions through Amazon or Boots in the coming weeks.\n\nHowever, these plans stalled last month when 4m antibody tests purchased from China at a cost of \u00a316m were found by Oxford University scientists to have both insufficient sensitivity and specificity for mass use. Up to 17.5m more tests have now been provisionally ordered from companies across the UK.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A serological screening machine in use at one of diagnostic company Quotient\u2019s labs. Photograph: Daniel Hager/Quotient/PA\n\nLast week two companies, Roche and Quotient, announced they have US and EU approval for an antibody test with 100% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity \u2013 however both these tests require a blood sample taken under medical supervision that must be analysed in a lab.\n\nLessons from HIV\n\nThe lessons of past infectious disease outbreaks have shown us that rushing large-scale epidemiological projects is inadvisable. Such initiatives need to be properly planned in order to gather reliable data.\n\nThe only comparable serosurveillance studies of this scale have been for HIV in the 1980s. One pioneer of these serosurveys across the US was James Curran, now professor of epidemiology at Emory University. One of the lessons we can take from that experience, says Curran, is that serosurveys are most useful when targeted at specific populations and that those for Covid-19 should initially be aimed at priority groups such as healthcare workers, care-home residents or schoolchildren to gain information that can be used to make decisions around public safety.\n\nHIV-infected individuals produce large amounts of non-neutralising antibodies that do nothing to clear the disease\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to do systematic surveys to find out what portion of certain populations have been infected and haven\u2019t, and do that for the highest priority groups,\u201d he says. \u201cThe danger is you\u2019re going to have everyone running off to get tested, and then you\u2019ll have to determine retrospectively how representative they are.\u201d\n\nCurran highlights the example of schoolchildren, who so far appear to be rarely affected by Covid- 19. \u201cWe know that children are very efficient transmitters of the influenza virus even if they don\u2019t get sick,\u201d he says. \u201cIs that true also for coronavirus? We need to know that before we reopen schools. They may not be at great risk of dying but they may be great at transmitting. So knowing the past history of the virus in children of various age groups will be really important.\u201d\n\nWill it prove immunity?\n\nOne of the hopes for antibody testing is that it will indicate whether those who have been infected by the virus will have some level of immunity, enabling governments to hand out \u201cimmunity passports\u201d that allow people to return to work.\n\nBut so far we do not know whether those who recover from Covid-19 actually have so-called neutralising antibodies, those that bind to a virus and block any future infection. Questions remain as to whether such antibodies stick around for life or wane over a period of months or years.\n\n\u201cAnswering that question will be critical when it comes to the success of the vaccines,\u201d says Elitza Theel, clinical microbiology director at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \u201cIs there going to be one vaccine or is it going to be like the flu where you need to get boosted and revaccinated every year?\u201d\n\nImmunity to pathogens is a spectrum ranging from the varicella-zoster virus (which causes chicken pox) \u2013 against which antibodies confer lifelong protection \u2013 to HIV, where infected individuals produce large amounts of non-neutralising antibodies that do nothing to clear the disease.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pupils undergo PCR and antibody testing on returning to high school, Hubei Province, China. Photograph: China News Service via Getty Images\n\nSo far, the only hints as to where Covid-19 sits on this spectrum have come from studies out of China. A recent investigation of 175 patients in Shanghai found that those who suffered severely from the virus produced large amounts of antibodies, while those with only mild bouts produced much lower levels. This suggests that people who suffer badly from Covid-19 could be protected against reinfection for a period of time, although immunologists are still trying to confirm that these definitely are neutralising antibodies.\n\n\u201cThe expectation is that there\u2019s at least partial, short-term immunity, but we don\u2019t know that for sure and we don\u2019t know if mildly infected patients have any form of immunity,\u201d says Theel. \u201cFor people that have had a short disease duration, it could be that their body killed off the virus quickly before there was time to mount an antibody response.\u201d\n\nIt will take some time to assess comprehensively the results of antibody testing, and ascertain the level of immunity that we have to Covid-19. People will need to be tested on multiple occasions over the course of months and years to see whether antibodies to the virus remain at a sufficiently high level in their blood. As a result many scientists believe that governments need to make decisions assuming that handing out immunity passports in the near future will not be possible.\n\nKoopmans believes that the practical solution is for governments to prepare to reopen societies with the infrastructure in place for conducting hundreds of thousands of ongoing swab tests.

They want to know what it is like, at an everyday level, to live through a global pandemic, to create an ongoing \u201cweather map of public feeling\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat we are experiencing is forcing new ways to interact with neighbours, friends and family,\u201d says Helen Goulden, chief executive of the Young Foundation, a charity working to strengthen communities. \u201cOur research pre-pandemic shows we were already concerned about safety because of insecure employment, crime and issues such as Brexit.\n\n\u201cNow, as lockdown eases, safety is becoming a deeply personal issue. People are not talking about lifting lockdown to ease inequalities or reduce the economic impact but about the direct risk to themselves and their families. Fifteen million people have underlying health problems \u2013 that impacts on a lot of families concerned for vulnerable relatives.\u201d\n\nMuseum of Covid-19: the story of the crisis told through everyday objects Read more\n\nOn Tuesday, more insight will be gained when the public is asked to keep a single-day diary, unmediated by journalists, commentators or government focus groups, for Mass Observation (MO), now housed at the University of Sussex. MO was established in 1937, when it recruited an army of volunteers and social scientists to create \u201can anthropology of home\u201d.\n\nAt the coronation of George VI on 12 May 1937, the concept of an annual day-long diary was instigated when the public was asked to record their activities and feelings over 24 hours. The scheme was revived again in 2010, and Tuesday marks its 10th anniversary. Anyone can participate, and all contributions are stored in the archive for posterity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s human nature to want to record our own feelings,\u201d says MO\u2019s curator Fiona Courage. \u201cSome people in Wuhan have said: \u2018I wrote every day. It helped to keep me sane.\u2019 Texts and emails mean that diaries have gone into abeyance but, in these extraordinary times, the longer form allows us all to be historians in our own way.\u201d\n\nNormally, the panel of volunteers who write all year round with MO numbers around 400. In the past few weeks, as more volunteers have come forward, the group has swollen to more than 700. The Fawcett Society, a feminist charity, is also asking women to send it their Covid-19 experiences.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest During the Blitz, MO diarists revealed they felt it was one war for the rich and another for the rest. Photograph: World History Archive/Alamy\n\nCovid 19 and Me is using NQuire, a scientific methodology, developed by the OU and overseen by the OU\u2019s Professor Anne Adams, that treats the public as \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d. \u201cCitizen scientists can help to influence policy-making in areas such as health, climate change and social inequality. Their contributions will also prepare us better for future pandemics,\u201d Adams explains.\n\n\u201cIt means that communities can connect up with experts who too often operate in their own boxes. Twitter and Instagram can trivialise. This is about the democratisation of all the channels of information, not just those that are instant or official.\u201d\n\nSo, what are the diaries revealing? How big a gap exists between government action and what the public expects? Whether newfound community solidarity can continue beyond the immediate crisis?\n\nOn 29 April, Professor Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England, during the government\u2019s daily briefing, called for more of what she termed, \u201clocal intelligence\u201d. Adams says \u201clocal intelligence\u201d ought to include these contributions from everyday life, in all its diversity and variations. Experts need to read the pulse of the public. \u201cThe government briefings are drowning in data but what makes the data meaningful is the connection between it and the stories that the public have to tell. People in cities, for instance, are noticing less pollution, clearer air, more birdsong \u2013 data apart, how will that impact on support for climate change post-Covid?\u201d\n\nCitizen scientists can influence policy making ... and their contributions will prepare us better for future pandemics. Professor Anne Adams, Open University\n\n\u201cWho would have thought in a liberal democracy so many people would do what they were told?\u201d the former cabinet secretary Gus O\u2019Donnell noted recently about the compliance to lockdown. Was that surprise because of a lack of feel for the warp and weft of what the public is really experiencing?\n\nDuring the Blitz, diarists for MO revealed that there was one war for the rich and another war for the rest. In heavily bombed Leicester, the rich were \u201ctaking their cars out into the country\u2026 and spending the night there\u201d \u2013 rather like some of those with country estates advocating a rapid easing of the lockdown now.\n\nGoulden points out it that it allegedly takes 21 days to make a habit and 90 days to break it. Already during the Covid-19 outbreak, the new habits include avoiding others, drinking more and rediscovering a sense of solidarity. Can the latter, at least, last? Or will that become fractured by easing the lockdown?\n\n\u201cPeople are writing to tell us that while they have bent the rules responsibly, others are doing so blatantly,\u201d says Goulden. \u201cA relaxation in rules may become increasingly contested, confused and personally interpreted, possibly leading to sharper exchanges between people and more stark inequalities at a national level.\u201d\n\nHowever, when events are changing so fast during the pandemic, can the diaries and questionnaires have any permanent value? Goulden agrees that they can only provide a snapshot, and contributors are, of course, self selecting. Over time, though, they may provide an invaluable picture of what we have lived through and what may have permanently changed.\n\nThe MO diaries during the war years reflected patriotism and admiration of Churchill but they also revealed the regard some had for Hitler, and a far less gung-ho spirit than the government portrayed. There was also a strong expression of the growing expectation that whatever came after the war had to be better.\n\nSo, will our contemporary diaries begin to record the limits on neighbourliness, respect for key workers and the NHS and mutual aid as we venture out of our homes? Or will they underline that health, wellbeing, fairness in society and all that has been lost to communities during austerity \u2013 parks, libraries, children\u2019s centres, youth clubs, community centres \u2013 have a newfound alue that no government can afford to ignore post-Covid?\n\nDiary extracts\n\n\n\n\n\nWoman, aged 30-44\n\nWe live in a fifth-floor flat in London, so we have been finding things a bit cramped and I had trouble getting my medications, but when the council support kicked in, this helped.

It resembles the scene of a bad traffic accident where shocked passers-by look away with pity and horror in their eyes. Alarmed by what they see, governments around the world practise their own form of social distancing. Once again, Britain is the sick man of Europe.\n\nLethal mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic is not the sole reason for this un-splendid isolation. The disease\u2019s sudden onslaught is the third national disaster in almost as many years. The first was the decision to walk away from Europe. The second was the advent of Donald Trump and his anarchic America First agenda.\n\nHowever the virus\u2019s death toll is calculated, the perception is taking hold, abroad as at home, that the Johnson government\u2019s performance is one of the world\u2019s worst, second possibly only to the US. Sympathy for Britain\u2019s plight has not forestalled scathing international criticism.\n\nItalians may surely be forgiven a sense of relief that their country is no longer Europe\u2019s biggest blackspot. With this unwanted title came the unspoken inference that Italy was uniquely unprepared. Some in the UK certainly saw it that way. They thought they were immune. They were betting, as usual, on a bogus British exceptionalism.\n\nBritain \u201cdid not pay enough attention to what was happening here\u201d, commented Beppe Severgnini in Corriere della Sera, referring to the two- to three-week period when Italy was ahead of the corona curve. The UK \u201clost the advantage that fate and Italy gave it... when it was obvious the virus was spreading\u201d.\n\nThe view of Britain as Europe\u2019s \u201cproblem child\u201d predates the pandemic but has been greatly reinforced by it. Foreign perceptions of the UK as a badly governed, disorderly, embittered and chronically divided country took deep root in the politically chaotic years that followed the 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that outside observers who were surprised by the anger and passion aroused by Brexit simply did not understand Britain. But the stunning levels of incompetence, jingoism and arrogance displayed by the British side during the withdrawal talks dismayed many Europeans. It was genuinely unexpected.\n\nThis altered view of Britain, or at least of Britain\u2019s government, as a not entirely serious, capable or trustworthy partner is not confined to Europe. Given that Brexit is premised on \u201cglobal Britain\u201d forging a web of dynamic new trade relationships, such reputational damage is potentially calamitous. Unpropitious, too, is the current plunge towards a world recession. The WTO predicts that trade may decline by up to 34%.\n\nWhat is China, for example, to make of leaders who fail to clearly disassociate from Trump\u2019s self-serving claims that Beijing deliberately spread what he calls the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d? Huffing and puffing on the Tory right over Huawei hardly bolsters Britain\u2019s claim to be a free-trade champion open for business.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s government is easy prey. The age of the unequal treaty is back - with Britain the loser this time\n\nYet Boris Johnson\u2019s government, ever more desperate for investment, is easy prey. Beijing\u2019s \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomats will see the lack of substance at the heart of a remarkably low-calibre cabinet, and spot a chance for knockdown bargains. The age of the unequal treaty is back \u2013 with Britain the loser this time.\n\n\n\nWhat is true of China is true in spades of Trump\u2019s America. Talks about a free-trade deal, begun last week, promise to expose the harsh reality of an isolated Britain\u2019s feeble leverage vis-\u00e0-vis a relentlessly self-interested superpower. Lowered food safety standards may be among many enforced compromises.\n\n\n\nYet the Trump presidency\u2019s negative impact on British interests and values far surpasses disputes about chlorinated chicken. Since 2017, Trump has blasted many holes in the foundations of UK security, defence and foreign policy. Britain long counted the US its foremost friend and vital ally. Now that bond is breaking.\n\nOn the climate crisis, on Iran, on Nato, on Israel-Palestine, on the UN and boycotted agencies such as the Human Rights Council, on multilateralism in general, on the primacy of international law, on relations with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, and on limiting new nuclear weapons, Trump has mostly ignored Britain\u2019s views.\n\n\n\nTo this sorry list of spats, splits and schisms may be added Trump\u2019s support for big cuts in foreign aid, crude Islamophobia, the militarisation of space, commercial exploitation of the Arctic and his worrying contempt for democracy, honesty and accountability, as revealed by the Mueller inquiry and his Senate impeachment.\n\n\n\nWhat Johnson and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, dare not admit, for it would wholly explode their Brexit fantasies, is that Trump\u2019s America has become an unreliable, problematic and in some respects, hostile entity, with a tendency to belittle Britain, not build it up. His re-election would extend and intensify the nightmare.\n\nTrump, the greatest of all coronavirus failures, is dangerous to know. And yet still they hug him close, risking infection, petitioning for a deal at almost any cost, mimicking his anti-Europe, populist posturing, rejecting pandemic cooperation with the EU and insisting, even now, that Brexit will be sewn up by December. A stitch-up is more likely. It will end in tears.\n\nOne disaster has swiftly followed another. Rarely in modern times has Britain\u2019s place in the world looked so precarious. Rarely has its global reputation for competence, pragmatism and good sense been so battered and disrespected. Rarely have its people and economy faced such challenges and such crippling levels of debt.\n\nPerhaps the last time the country stood alone like this, frightened, sickened, beleaguered, lacking funds and resources and separated from friends, was when it faced a deadly invasion of a different type, 80 years ago next month. As it remembers the victory in Europe that eventually followed in 1945, Britain needs another miracle, a fresh strategy \u2013 and much better leaders.", "author": ["Simon Tisdall"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/johnson-and-starmer-both-know-a-true-exit-plan-means-reducing-our-freedoms", "published": "2020-05-10T07:00:18", "title": "Johnson and Starmer both know true exit plan means reducing our freedoms", "text": "A commonplace criticism of political parties is that they have drifted \u201cinto their comfort zone\u201d, which mostly means that Labour talks a lot about raising spending, while the Conservatives talk about cutting taxes. But politicians have comfort zones that are operational as well as ideological: ways of working that they find more attractive than others.\n\nIn late 2014, one ambitious young shadow cabinet minister asked his aides to draw up a 14-point plan to help him become leader of the Labour party. Step two involved an itemised list of Labour MPs, each of whom, he was told, he needed to wine and dine if he was to have any hope of making a successful bid at the job. The frontbencher in question contemplated evening after evening spent in conversation with his colleagues versus time spent with his wife and children. Surely, he reasoned, he could achieve the same end by writing thoughtful columns in the newspapers and delivering wide-ranging speeches? His leadership bid never recovered.\n\nThe government has, similarly, fallen back into its comfort zone in the fight against coronavirus. There are few problems in life that Whitehall doesn\u2019t seek to solve through swallowing up our personal details: if the second coming were to take place in modern Britain, the authorities would doubtless immediately want Jesus to fill in 2,000 years of backdated tax returns.\n\nThe desire to know our secrets is present in essentially every British government regardless of its political hue\n\nOfficialdom\u2019s addiction to hoovering up information has numerous benefits: it has allowed the Office for National Statistics to establish a link between ethnicity and the risk of dying of Covid-19, because it was able to eliminate other explanations \u2013 income level, household type, occupation and so on \u2013 through the use of the vast reams of information that the state collects.\n\nBut the downside of the government\u2019s appetite for surveillance can be found in the NHSX contact tracing app that is a vital plank of any attempt to keep new infections down and isolate outbreaks once lockdown ends. Although the app asks only for a postcode, storing the information centrally will allow the government, armed with the huge amounts of data it already holds, to identify other facts and secrets about the app\u2019s users. That horrifies privacy campaigners, but the biggest problem in practice will be the efficiency of the app. As designed, it is a battery hog that saps the life from users\u2019 phones \u2013 probably a far bigger barrier to people downloading it than its implications for surveillance. A second app is now in development \u2013 one that will be free of the government\u2019s tendency to collect as much information as it can about citizens.\n\nThe endless desire to know our secrets is present in essentially every British government, regardless of its political hue. But this government has also reverted to a comfort zone that is distinct to itself: treating the battle against the virus as if it were a battle against a rival political party, one to be defeated by a savvy media strategy and careful leaks to preferred outlets. Genuine transparency should be kept to a minimum, with real news confined to setpiece events featuring the government\u2019s biggest gun, the prime minister.\n\nAs a method to dispatch Labour in 2019, it worked like a charm. As an approach to defeating Covid-19 it lacks a certain something. Leaks beget leaks \u2013 cabinet ministers see that leaks are emerging from \u201cDowning Street\u201d and grumble to journalists; civil servants surmise that their bosses are spreading stories too, and also complain to the press. The process has also led to a muddled understanding of what exactly is being eased and when.\n\nOne Conservative gleefully told me that they would make Starmer 'a collaborator' in any politically painful decisions\n\nThe reality is that the changes to how we live \u2013 people to be able to go out for exercise twice a day, garden centres to be reopened \u2013 are minor and sensible. The disease spreads less effectively in the open air, provided people observe physical distancing. It\u2019s easy to observe social distancing in garden centres, which will, in any case, probably fold if they cannot reopen over the coming months, which are as important to them as Christmas is to the high street. But the drip-drip of headlines suggesting an \u201cend\u201d to lockdown has made some voters think the government is taking unnecessary risks, and encouraged others to take unnecessary risks of their own, safe in the apparent certainty that the lockdown will soon be ended.\n\nThe comfort zone strategy has real long-term downsides, too. MPs generally agree that Keir Starmer has had a good week: the Labour leader\u2019s call for the government to publish its lockdown exit plan has been validated twice over, once by the unhelpful culture of leaks and hints about what is to come, and once because, when all is said and done, the government will have actually produced and published an exit strategy.\n\nThe fear among Labour MPs, however, is that the government will try to bind Starmer to any unpopular measures he signs up to. One Conservative gleefully told me that they would make Starmer \u201ca collaborator\u201d in any politically painful decisions. Hardly anyone believes that the global increase in the popularity of incumbent governments will last all the way to the next general election, but many think it will be harder for Starmer to criticise the government\u2019s unpopular decisions \u2013 of which, it\u2019s assumed, there will be many, due to the economic consequences of the lockdown \u2013 if he has been brought into the fold.\n\nBoris Johnson has had regular conversations with the opposition parties, but he has thus far failed to establish any crucial moments at which Starmer\u2019s hands are also at the tiller. The leaks have also allowed the devolved governments in Scotland and Wales, neither of which have been without fault during the crisis, to assert their distinctiveness from Westminster simply by clearly communicating a near-identical approach openly and transparently, rather than through the pages of favoured papers.\n\nBut the comfort zone approach has obscured an issue that ought to be a real source of political pain for Johnson and Starmer. The way out of lockdown isn\u2019t a mystery: governments must first reduce the rate of new transmissions to as close to zero as possible, and then have the necessary infrastructure to test at scale, track the movements of possible carriers, and isolate the infected as and when new outbreaks emerge.\n\nThere are two barriers in the UK\u2019s path to that destination. The first is logistical: Britain doesn\u2019t yet have the capacity to implement a system of testing, tracking and isolating infections. That is a painful area for the Conservatives, as it means discussing whether they have fallen short in procurement, or if the spending decisions taken since 2010 have left the state ill prepared for crisis.\n\nBut the second barrier is painful for both parties: a functioning system of testing, tracing and isolating new cases would require a major reduction in our liberties and a prolonged period of increased surveillance. It\u2019s far from clear that there is a majority in parliament for that approach, and it\u2019s not a natural political position for Johnson or Starmer. Both are commonly said to be \u201cinstinctive liberals\u201d, though their records at the big organisations they ran, whether as mayor of London or director of public prosecutions, are muddier than that.\n\nWhat matters more is that most British people are not liberals, instinctive or otherwise. It\u2019s easy to forget that while New Labour\u2019s ID cards scheme was unpopular within the party and in parliament, it enjoyed majority support in the country as a whole. The great British public has enthusiastically embraced CCTV, and no successful political party in the democratic era has been without a generous bung to the police. Whether the SNP in 2007, Johnson in 2019 or even Jeremy Corbyn in 2017, the way to win votes and influence people in British politics has long run on an authoritarian axis.\n\nSo what will happen if British politics is dominated by two men, neither of whom are instinctively minded to point to the clearest and safest way out of lockdown? The lesson of Johnson\u2019s recent electoral success, in which he tapped into a political demand that has long existed \u2013 for a party that is tough on migrants and criminals but spends lavishly on the NHS and schools \u2013 but has been unavailable to voters since 2005, is that eventually the voters get what the voters want. If neither Johnson nor Starmer is willing to leave their comfort zone, they may find that someone else will.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Bush is the political editor of the New Statesman", "author": ["Stephen Bush"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/the-observer-view-on-the-governments-lack-of-a-proper-lockdown-plan", "published": "2020-05-10T05:00:16", "title": "The Observer view on the government's lack of a proper lockdown plan | Observer editorial", "text": "\u2018In spite of the sunny bank holiday, it is vitally important that we continue to abide by the current restrictions: stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d That was the message delivered by the environment secretary, George Eustice, at Friday afternoon\u2019s press conference. Yet just the day before, most newspapers were emblazoned with excited headlines foretelling a significant relaxation of social distancing restrictions, based on briefing from government sources: \u201cLockdown freedom beckons\u201d, \u201cFirst steps to freedom from Monday\u201d and \u201cStay home advice to be scrapped\u201d.\n\nDespite the critical importance of clear public messaging to any public health strategy, the government\u2019s communications have been marred by mixed messages throughout this deadly pandemic. Its core message, asking the public to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives, has been very effective, but this has consistently been undermined by ministers and advisers inaccurately briefing the press that there is about to be a shift in policy. Before the Easter weekend, reports appeared that ministers thought that the public had been too obedient in following the lockdown, and that a relaxation was imminent. The same happened before this bank holiday weekend, forcing the government to clarify that there was no change in restrictions and that people must continue to abide by the law.\n\nThe tone of these briefings has been shockingly out of step with reality. Last week, the UK\u2019s official death toll overtook Italy\u2019s to make us the worst-hit country in Europe at this point (the UK\u2019s official statistics capture a smaller proportion of excess deaths than in many other European countries, suggesting that, if anything, the UK will look worse as the death toll becomes more accurate). Every day, hundreds of families lose their loved ones to this virus, healthcare workers put their lives at risk by going to work without adequate protection, and care homes struggle to manage the spread of the disease among residents. As a result of high levels of public compliance with the lockdown, infection rates have fallen, but not to a point where there can be any significant relaxation of social distancing: the measures that will be announced later today will rightly be very incremental.\n\nIt beggars belief that government sources have, regardless, been briefing that the end of lockdown is nigh, and floating, then stepping back from, major policy changes \u2013 such as the potential for households to mix in closed groups of up to 10 people. It is a recipe for sowing confusion and seeding a laidback approach to social distancing. New policy should be announced only to parliament or at the daily press conference. We can only hope that the public continues to listen to and comply with social distancing, despite the government\u2019s unclear messages.\n\nThese shambolic communications are a sign of a worrying lack of competence at the heart of government. Bombastic war metaphors are being used as a substitute for long-term strategy. The government\u2019s success in rapidly expanding NHS critical care capacity has not been matched in other areas, from ensuring adequate supplies of protective equipment for frontline workers, to delays in expanding testing capacity, to the disaster that is unfolding in many care homes.\n\nBombastic war metaphors are being used as a substitute for long-term strategy\n\nThe government has consistently faced calls from the opposition and scientific experts to be more transparent about how it intends to relax social distancing restrictions without triggering a second wave of deaths later in the year. Any significant relaxation of the lockdown is contingent not just on getting infection rates lower but on having adequate testing and tracing capacity to quickly identify and isolate new outbreaks.\n\nYet the government has failed to publish a proper strategy. It has adopted arbitrary testing targets: first a quarter of a million tests a day, then 100,000, and now 200,000, without explaining how these targets fit into a strategy for managing future outbreaks. It manipulated testing figures \u2013 sending out a large number of tests post on one particular day, and counting these as completed tests \u2013 in order to meet its arbitrary 100,000 target, which it has since fallen back from. It would make more sense to adopt a dynamic target that aims to keep the proportion of tests that come back positive below a fixed figure: this would help ensure that we are testing in sufficient numbers given the incidence of the virus. We do not know what assumptions the government is relying upon; for example, how quickly test results will need to be turned around to feed into an effective track and trace system.\n\nIn terms of tracing, experience from countries such as Singapore suggests that technology and contact tracing apps can only assist, not replace, teams of human contact tracers. Yet there are worrying signs the UK may be relying too heavily on the development of an app, with all the privacy concerns that this involves, and not enough on building skilled teams of contact tracers. While it has committed to recruiting 18,000 contact tracers by the middle of this month, this may not be enough, and it emerged last week that the government is in talks with large private-sector contractors to provide 15,000 call-centre staff, who would have only a day\u2019s training. One company is Serco, which was last year fined \u00a323m by the Serious Fraud Office over its delivery of electronic tagging contracts. Meanwhile, it is unclear if and how the government intends to deploy the thousands of environmental health officers who work for local councils; it has been far too slow to involve local government public health experts in other areas, for example testing in care homes.\n\nThis is the most difficult governing challenge the country has faced in decades; the gaps in our knowledge about this virus means that there is often uncertainty as to the best way forward. It would be unreasonable to expect a government to make no missteps. Yet the evidence is mounting that this government\u2019s rank incompetence has contributed to the terrible numbers of deaths of recent weeks. This cannot wait for a post-hoc public inquiry: ministers have to face up to and learn from their mistakes in the here and now.

The virus acts like no other pathogen. Two metres is entirely subjective now, expanding and contracting to meet our needs. Time is non-Newtonian, like the cornflour you\u2019ve probably resorted to if you have small children to entertain, stiff and fluid at once. Numbers are basically meaningless: in pandemic maths, a figure such as 413 deaths \u2013 the one released on the day I am writing, an unthinkable catastrophe at another time \u2013 is encouraging, a cause for some optimism.\n\nThe old certainties are eroded, but tucked away in our isolation pods, new physical laws are emerging for this way of living. The science is in its early stages, but empirically, some important developments have been observed. As a person with absolutely no grasp of science of any kind, I am your perfect guide to these.\n\n1. Wherever you want to be in your lockdown space, someone else urgently needs to be there. Yes, right now. In my space, that person is also always wielding a hammer. I believe it was Chekhov who said do not introduce a hammer in act 1 if you are not going to hammer like a maniac through acts 2-4 and this dramatic principle is respected here.\n\n2. Windows. However you like them is the opposite of how your fellow inmates like them. Now your life is just a window-based war of attrition. This is how the new proverb \u201cWhen a window opens, a window closes\u201d has emerged.\n\n3. Since we are all now ruminants, constantly grazing, we have developed an extra stomach to accommodate our preferred self-soothing lockdown snack when full of other foods. I have a cheese and onion crisp stomach now. Don\u2019t argue with science.\n\n4. Speaking of food, that treat item you have been looking forward to, saving, obsessing over? Someone has already eaten it. They didn\u2019t even enjoy it! They were just filling time. They might even have left a bit, in the bin for you to find.\n\n5. On the topic of bins, Bin Perception Syndrome, whilst not new to science, has been reportedly exacerbated during the corona crisis. The syndrome manifests in two ways: either sufferers can no longer see the bin at all, even when surrounded by flies and being excavated by an opportunistic dog, or they can see nothing but the bin, which they perceive as vast, pulsing, taking up their entire consciousness.\n\n6. Fractions: for any attempt to watch something \u201cas a family\u201d or other collective isolation unit, the following proportions apply: \u00bc asleep; \u00bc claimed they wanted to watch but are now fiddling with their phones; \u00bc never pretended they would do anything but fiddle with their phones; and \u00bc loudly criticising, hating every moment, but in fact the only person with eyes actually on screen.\n\n7. If you work solidly for eight hours, taking only two 10-minute breaks and ostentatiously mention how busy you are and how imperative it is that you must not be disturbed, the only time someone will disturb you is during those 10-minute breaks, when you will be either watching a video of a horse with a luxuriant moustache or attempting a headstand. You will not be succeeding at the headstand when interrupted: you will be flailing like a capsized turtle.\n\n8. The apex predator in every new urban multi-prey system is the seagull. This is another excellent reason not to go outside: with no discarded KFC Zingers to feast on, they are hungrier and angrier than ever.\n\n9. Biologists have also observed that a new, lean super-species of domestic dog is emerging thanks to frequent lengthy walks taken by pod members to get away from other pod members, using the dog as an excuse. The pod is creating a post-lockdown rod for its own back with the super-dog, which will require a minimum of four hours daily exercise.\n\n10. Incidence of podcasting in the general population runs at 0.08%. In males aged 28-50 in lockdown it runs at 79%. They used to say you were never more than 6ft from a rat, now you\u2019re never more than two houses from a man with opinions and a microphone.\n\n11. All conversations follow a fixed formula that my friend has named the \u201ccoronam\u00f6bius strip\u201d, looping and repeating infinitely. Nothing has happened to any of us (if we\u2019re lucky), but we need to express it, yet again.\n\n12. There is a fixed amount of morale in a lockdown space. It does not increase or decrease, simply passes between individuals within the space. The nice thing about this is that you can reframe your filthy moods as an act of altruism towards other pod members.\n\nFollow Emma on Twitter @BelgianWaffling", "author": ["Emma Beddington"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/people-would-be-going-hungry-how-a-london-charity-is-responding-to-coronavirus-crisis", "published": "2020-05-10T08:02:10", "title": "'People would be going hungry': how a London charity is responding to coronavirus crisis", "text": "Brown bread. Baked beans. Tea. And would you happen to have any custard, dear?\n\nSome things stand out in the middle of the prodigiously energetic food-parcel line being run from a community hall in south-east London.\n\nBlue-top milk is still undisputed world No 1 around here. Processed dairy-based desserts are king. Anecdotal evidence suggests that even in the time of pandemic at least 85% of south London\u2019s elderly women would really, really like to invite you in for a cup of tea and a chat. And then there is of course some heartbreak, too.\n\nLewisham can look like a barely contained urban sprawl at the best of times. This is a London borough with a population just shy of Iceland, where a third of children live in poverty, and where the efforts of local charities to provide a food delivery service for vulnerable people is another understated human triumph of the Covid-19 shutdown.\n\nActing on a hunch, Voluntary Services Lewisham delivered its first food parcel on 20 March, just as corona-fear really began to bite. By 24 April it was packing 200 parcels in a single day.\n\nTwo thousand people are relying on a process conjured from a standing start at VSL\u2019s pillbox-like town centre hall, known according to local myth as the first place Kate Bush sang live, and HQ now of a much-loved local charity set up in 1969 to care for the needy of the borough.\n\nRight now they\u2019re operating in overdrive. \u201cIt\u2019s new to us,\u201d Stephen Oldfield, the deputy CEO, says. \u201cThe only experience we had of this was delivering Christmas hampers. So we took that operation and basically scaled it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe took the view, get things done and find the process as it happens. The idea is, if you\u2019re a person without food, we\u2019re going to get you something.\u201d And if they hadn\u2019t done this, if they hadn\u2019t just got on with it? \u201cPeople would be going hungry.\u201d\n\nTen years of austerity have already hit Lewisham hard. The housing stock is densely packed. Households are cluttered. Throw in a virus that prays disproportionately on the poor, the elderly and black and ethnic minority people, and the notion of Lewisham without this safety net of interlocking charities is an alarming prospect.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shoppers at Lewisham market in south London.

Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA\n\nI volunteered with VSL in March to do some deliveries, one of 2,000 local people to join the borough\u2019s concerted coronavirus response across an umbrella of charities. The food box circuit takes you through an urban landscape that has simply stopped.\n\nDriving west through the industrial shadows of Bermondsey, flattened by bombs and rebuilt by bulldozers, the deliveries take you into a maze of blocks and interlinking towers. Head south to Downham and Bellingham and the sky opens out into green suburban cul de sacs. Go north to Forest Hill and the streets are leafier and more grand, a high rise plateau above the city.\n\nQ&A What are the UK government's 'five tests' for ending lockdown restrictions? Show Hide The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions: The NHS has sufficient capacity to provide critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK\n\nA sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from Coronavirus\n\nReliable data to show that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board\n\nOperational challenges including testing and personal protective equipement (PPE) are in hand with supply able to meet future demand\n\nConfident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS\n\nThe story is the same everywhere. VSL\u2019s boxes are for self-isolating people running short of food: \u00a315 gets you a mix of essentials, fresh stuff and high-yield carbs, topped with a chocolate bar, a frilly soap and the triumph of toilet roll. Alongside this are free boxes for those who have made it on to the NHS\u2019s million-strong \u201cshielded\u201d list, the most vulnerable for whom staying inside is a matter of life and death, lockdown an ordeal on top of an ordeal.\n\nA safe delivery distance is kept at all times, although there\u2019s not much you can do about security doors and lifts and cramped corridors.\n\nPeople wave from the window or shout through the front door.\n\n\n\nA middle-aged man hands out a fluent telling off though his surgical mask over the amount of time taken to answer the phone last week, in between saying thanks for the pasta sauce and bread. It is all quite reassuring.\n\nThen there\u2019s the heartbreak. A frequent theme is dislocation and confusion. One shielded resident answers the pre-delivery call from a temporary address in the north, where she\u2019s been forced to move by contagion in her old block. She can\u2019t leave the house. She doesn\u2019t have any food. She\u2019s terminally ill. No one is coming to help.\n\nOr at least, not until now. There is of course an avalanche of lessons to be drawn from the crisis. Lewisham may not be a prosperous place, but it does at least have a structure, a network of care in place, and a sense of civic duty.\n\nTwo things stand out. VSL has had to buy its own protective gear (one bulk delivery of masks still hasn\u2019t turned up yet) but it has enough to go on for now, with gloves and hand-sanitiser stacked on every desk. No matter: keep distant, wash your hands a lot and get on with it.\n\nSecondly, and even more so now, the future is a daunting prospect. \u201cWe are expecting a lot more people to need help when this is over or as it goes along. People will just run out of money,\u201d Oldfield says.\n\nAs ever, charities, donations, volunteers and austerity-hit local government will pick up the slack. The lessons of Lewisham? \u201cWherever you are, find your interest and volunteer. It enhances your life.

Lots of people seem to be jumping on board, claiming any perceived privacy downsides as a small price to pay. Others, with earlier smartphones, were excluded. Older residents overheard in the post office said they really wanted to use the app but their steam-powered mobile phones weren\u2019t capable.\n\n\n\nDespite the messaging that this was not the end of lockdown, we\u2019ve had reports that the streets are busier than usual\n\nSome took to Facebook to voice their concerns about Big Brother spying on them (cue irony explosion).

For one thing, the public aren\u2019t thinking of the statistics as dry and abstract: they understand how critical they are. People are learning about methodologies and bell curves and logarithmic scales because they\u2019re no longer inclined to look away from the screen when they see those words. That means there are also huge opportunities to learn and for people to change their (usually negative!) relationship with numbers.\n\n\n\nI think we\u2019ve always had the responsibility to inform without making people feel afraid, alone or sad. At first though, especially here in the US, it felt like not enough people were sufficiently scared. It was fear that was compelling me to stay at home \u2013 fear of making other people sick and fear of getting sick myself. So I was trying to create data visualisations that had that emotional resonance too. Illustrations that showed the numbers in a way that communicated the seriousness of this situation. I think that now the need has shifted a little where most people grasp the gravity of the situation. They need information about how to cope.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Visual journalists have to come up with ways of explaining and contextualising the numbers. Illustration: Mona Chalabi\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Caelainn Barr\n\nCaelainn Barr, data projects editor\n\nData is key in this crisis. It tells us the story of how the virus is spreading, who it affects most and, with political will, it could help pave the way out.\n\nI am fascinated by what is left out of datasets. What we collect and omit tells us something about what we value and overlook as a society. If you don\u2019t have data you can\u2019t understand a problem or begin to formulate effective public policy to address it. As a journalist the gaps in datasets also give you a sense of what is not understood and should be examined in greater depth. This line of thinking has informed much of our reporting to date.\n\nWe have uncovered flaws in the government death toll, shown how the most deprived would be disproportionately affected if parks were closed, revealed BAME people are more at risk of dying from Covid-19, and explored why the poor are twice as likely to die of the virus as the rich.\n\nWork is incredibly demanding at the moment. Very often we\u2019re trying to make sense of new information and patchy datasets in a rapidly evolving crisis. So far data has shown us that the virus is certainly not a social leveller, rather it has found the cracks in society and blown them wide open, making long-standing inequalities painfully clear. By inquiring beyond the headline numbers, data can help us understand who the virus is affecting the most so we can forge a fairer society once this has passed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Graphic showing areas with high BAME populations have higher Covid-19 death rates. Source: Guardian analysis of ONS data Composite: Guardian\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pamela Duncan\n\nPamela Duncan, data journalist\n\nCounting the human cost of the coronavirus has been one of the greatest challenges faced professionally by journalists since the onset of the pandemic: even the number of deaths is genuinely hard to provide.\n\n\n\nPart of the problem is that data collection and reporting by the responsible agencies in the UK and elsewhere has been slow to become uniform: ordinarily deaths are collected by statistical bodies with a delay. But deaths due to Covid-19 are of obvious public interest and so the figures need to be circulated. Therefore, for data journalists like myself, much of the past two months has been spent chasing data; figuring out which deaths have and have not been included in various organisations\u2019 figures; finding out what we can and cannot compare.\n\n\n\nAs a Guardian journalist you are always focused on reporting the truth. Never has this been more pronounced than in this crisis, where you are hyper-aware that underreporting the figures could cause complacency whereas exaggerating them could cause panic. Some have criticised journalists for not being critical enough while others wrongly, and dangerously, suggest that the figures are exaggerated. But it isn\u2019t those people we concern ourselves with: it is getting to the truth and pointing out what we know when we know it. This means that we aren\u2019t just putting out a BIG FIGURE and leaving it at that. Instead we are explaining why we think the BIG FIGURE isn\u2019t the whole picture. We have faith in our audience\u2019s ability to recognise that we may not have all the answers right now but that we are working tirelessly to get them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nick Evershed\n\nNick Evershed, data and interactives editor, Guardian Australia\n\nAustralia is now a success story in terms of its early response to Covid-19, with new cases now often below 20 a day, and far fewer deaths per million people than other countries. How this early success in flattening the curve transitions into an easing of restrictions and the prospect of a second wave remains to be seen.\n\nWhen the pandemic started worsening in Australia, there were significant challenges with reporting on basic aspects of the outbreak.\n\nBecause of the difference in reporting times and methods, getting basic information correct such as the number of cases, deaths, and testing rates required staying on top of information released by nine governments.\n\nInspired by other projects doing similar work we started tracking these figures internally, and then decided to release the data with a licence allowing reuse. This decision paid off \u2013 the data has been used by researchers, private companies and ordinary citizens to analyse and visualise the pandemic\u2019s impact on Australia.\n\nHaving the data openly accessible also means our figures are constantly being checked, ensuring they are as accurate as possible. This was especially helpful in the early days when significant time pressure would inevitably mean some mistakes \u2013 thankfully quickly corrected in response to reader emails.\n\nThe response has been phenomenal. The summary page has been one of the most popular pieces we have produced during the pandemic, with 5.4m page views at the time of writing. The data also is used in all our liveblogs to give readers a quick summary of the current situation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cumulative count of confirmed Covid-19 cases by state and territory The most recent day is usually based on incomplete data.

He had been in poor health for several years, suffering hip problems, a stroke and a heart attack.\n\nRichard\u2019s son, Danny Penniman, first confirmed the pioneer\u2019s death. In a statement, Richard\u2019s agent, Dick Alen, said: \u201cLittle Richard passed away this morning from bone cancer in Nashville.\n\n\u201cHe was battling for a good while, many years. I last spoke to him about two or three weeks ago. I knew he wasn\u2019t well but he never really got into it, he just would say \u2018I\u2019m not well.\u2019\u201d\n\nRichard\u2019s career began when in the late 1940s but his early recordings with RCA Victor garnered little success. His breakthrough came when he signed to Specialty Records in 1955, releasing a run of wild and flamboyant singles \u2013 Tutti Frutti, Long Tall Sally, Rip It Up, The Girl Can\u2019t Help It, Lucille, Keep A-Knockin\u2019 and Good Golly, Miss Molly, among others \u2013 that made him a star on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe biographer Charles White described the songs as \u201choly writs of rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Little Richard in concert.\n\nRichard was known for his outrageous performance style at the piano \u2013 eyes lined with mascara, pompadour hair fixed with potato starch, ferocious eyes transfixing audiences \u2013 and infectious whoops, a style echoed by dozens of performers, Prince prominent among them. Richard had been a drag performer and by his own admission was involved in voyeurism, allowing men to have sex in the back seat of his car while he watched. He was arrested at least twice for lewd conduct.\n\nHis breakthrough single, Tutti Frutti, was originally about anal sex \u2013 \u201cIf it don\u2019t fit, don\u2019t force it / You can grease it, make it easy\u201d \u2013 until producer Bumps Blackwell suggested it be cleaned up.

It was actually the Sputnik 1 satellite, but he took it as a sign from God that he needed to change his ways. In 1958 he became a preacher, before returning to secular music in 1962. The conflict between God and the devil\u2019s music was a theme for much of the rest of his life. In old age, Richard renounced his omnisexuality, saying he had asked God to save him.\n\nRichard\u2019s conflict over the sacred and the profane, and which course to follow, was central to his sound, said writer Anthony DeCurtis.\n\n\u201cHe left stardom at a very high point in the 50s to become a minister, He went back and forth on it, and it played a role in what he had to say about his sexuality,\u201d said DeCurtis. \u201cAt points he talked about himself as always being gay, at other points he said God made a man to be a man and woman to be a woman. He talked about being bisexual, or omnisexual. That kind of struggle lent forth to his music, and that is part of what drove the madness of those early songs.\u201d\n\nHis Specialty singles exerted a profound influence. The Beatles performed Richard\u2019s songs.\n\n\u201cI could do Little Richard\u2019s voice, which is a wild, hoarse, screaming thing.

Measures will include pop-up bike lanes and wider pavements as well as cycle and bus-only streets. Trials of e-scooters will also be fast-tracked in a bid to get rental schemes up and running in cities as fast as possible.\n\nThe length of time that temporary road closures around schools would last, and precisely how they work, will be left up to local councils. But both London mayor Sadiq Khan and the mayor of Greater Manchester, have made clear money will be available and emergency powers can be used to allow them to do so.\n\nThey say the closures would also make it safer for people to walk or cycle at safe distances from each other en route to and from schools, and help buses carrying children avoid running into heavy congestion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sadiq Khan: \u2018If people switch only a fraction of journeys to cars, London risks grinding to a halt, air quality will worsen, and road danger will increase.\u2019 Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty\n\nChris Boardman, the former Olympic cycling gold medallist, who is now cycling and walking commissioner for Greater Manchester, said the current crisis had created a unique opportunity to try out ideas that people might find they want to adopt permanently.\n\nIn Manchester, councils had been given \u00a35m to help develop such schemes and had emergency powers to close or adapt roads. \u201cThey [councils] could say, right we need to make a lot more space around these schools so people will stay apart.

If people switch only a fraction of these journeys to cars, London risks grinding to a halt, air quality will worsen, and road danger will increase.\n\n\u201cModelling has shown that there is potential for a tenfold increase in kilometres cycled and up to five times the amount of walking. Our Streetspace plan will act as a catalyst for this change, fast-tracking schemes that will enable many more people to take to two wheels or travel on foot.

The true figure is believed to be much higher.\n\nSome 215,260 people have tested positive, an increase of 3,896 cases since Friday. A total of 96,878 tests were carried out on Friday, the sixth day running that the government has failed to reach its target of 100,000 tests a day.

Another would be \u201cto really get to grips with contact tracing,\u201d according to Woolhouse, who is one of the UK\u2019s leading experts on infectious diseases: \u201cOtherwise I do not see how we are going to get any further forward and get out of this situation.\u201d\n\nDowning St insisted Johnson was determined to proceed with \u201cmaximum caution\u201d \u2013 despite mixed messages last week about a relaxation of measures from Monday.

If one gets stopped, three get through. But because of the lack of opportunity they\u2019re either sending two lots of 50 or 100 in one go, which they wouldn\u2019t normally do. We\u2019ve had some massive seizures.\u201d\n\nAt street level, drugs are also being moved around in larger quantities. NCA intelligence reveals dealers are less likely to offer sales of, for instance, single rocks of crack cocaine and instead are offering bulk deals to limit interaction with users.\n\nDisguise, said Gibbons, had also become an established tactic for street dealers. \u201cMany disguise themselves as key workers \u2013 some as couriers with yellow high-vis slips to look as though they are making official deliveries [medical supplies].\n\n\u201cOthers have changed their timings so they only work certain times of the day or night, rather than a 24/7 service.\u201d he added.\n\nSince the lockdown, the market has been relatively stable, with small price increases across all substances Niamh Eastwood, Release\n\nAlthough global drug production in countries such as Colombia and Afghanistan, where heroin is produced, has remained largely unaffected by the pandemic, localised shortages in the UK have seen the price of heroin double in some places.\n\nHowever, the drugs charity Release has called for UK police to suspend its dismantling of drug syndicates and \u201cde-prioritise drugs\u201d, both for users and suppliers, warning that it could disrupt the availability of illicit substances and push addicts to try more harmful alternatives.\n\nIts monitoring of the UK drugs trade since the lockdown had, though, indicated the market was durable. \u201cSince the lockdown, the market has been relatively stable, with small price increases across all substances, and reports of purity declining, especially for heroin and crack cocaine,\u201d said Niamh Eastwood, a Release spokesperson.\n\nSteve Rolles, senior policy analyst at charity Transform, said that most initial research into the impact of the lockdown on the drugs trade had confounded expert predictions. \u201cDrug markets have been a lot more resilient than most people expected in terms of supply,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong recent seizures involving the NCA was the recent dismantling of an international drug-smuggling ring in Galicia, north-west Spain. In total four tonnes of cocaine were seized along with a small flotilla of \u201cboats and speedboats\u201d used for transporting the drugs. Twenty-eight people were arrested.\n\nLast Tuesday UK Border Force officers intercepted a van in northern France claiming to be carrying medical supplies to a UK hospital but found to be also transporting 285kg of cocaine worth more than \u00a325m at street prices.\n\nDays earlier a lorry holding 260kg of cocaine was stopped by UK officials at the French entrance to the Eurotunnel.\n\nYet police believe organised criminals are mostly targeting UK container ports, using a practice Gibbons called \u201crip on, rip off\u201d where drugs are stashed in legitimate shipping containers and are then retrieved, often using corrupt port officials.

But its content could have been very different, reveals a document freshly unearthed by a historian researching the life of Winston Churchill.\n\nOn 5 March 1946 in Fulton, Missouri, before a huge crowd which included the US president, Harry Truman, Britain\u2019s wartime leader issued a famous description of the political division that was opening across Europe between the Soviet-dominated Communist east and the western democracies. \u201cFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic,\u201d Churchill declared, \u201can iron curtain has descended across the continent.\u201d\n\nAnd yet in the months running up to its delivery, the man widely regarded as Britain\u2019s greatest prime minister, whose bulldog spirit has often been invoked by anti-EU campaigners, toyed with using the speech to promote his vision of a United States of Europe.\n\nAn overlooked letter, buried in the archives of the New-York Historical Society, from journalist Walter Graebner to the publisher of Life magazine, Andrew Heiskell, reveals how Churchill thought Fulton might be the perfect location to talk not so much about the threat of communism but the future of a federal Europe.\n\nGraebner had been dispatched to secure Churchill\u2019s memoirs for his magazine and the five-page letter provides a fascinating detail of Churchill\u2019s life in the post-war years.\n\nIt reveals that initially Life magazine\u2019s owner, Time Life, had offered to buy three articles written by Churchill for \u00a325,000 each, the combined equivalent of more than \u00a33m in today\u2019s money.\n\nVE Day: Churchill feared De Gaulle would declare victory early Read more\n\nGraebner\u2019s wooing of Churchill, who became prime minister exactly 80 years ago on Sunday, was a tortuous process conducted over many months at his suite in Claridge\u2019s hotel in Mayfair, his Hyde Park mansion and Chartwell, his country home in Kent.\n\nDuring early negotiations, Graebner records that Churchill would sit in bed wearing a Chinese dressing grown and smoking a cigar, which he kept relighting with a candle.\n\nKey to Churchill agreeing to write for the magazine was its decision to purchase some of his paintings, which Graebner saw as giving his publisher the \u201cinside track to his memoirs\u201d.\n\nChurchill gave Graebner one of the paintings \u2013 a \u201csmall harbour scene with lots of little boats painted in pleasant shades of blues greys and whites\u201d \u2013 after the journalist admired it.\n\nHaving a day with Churchill was very often like being subjected to a series of trial speeches Prof Richard Toye, historian\n\n\u201cThey did have quite a warm relationship and Churchill could be a generous person,\u201d said Professor Richard Toye, a historian at the University of Exeter who discovered the letter while researching his forthcoming book, Winston Churchill: A Life in the News.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to remember that he\u2019s cultivating a press contact. Time Life are going to be very generous towards him in terms of the amount of money they are going to pay for his memoirs. His instincts were certainly generous but he got an awful lot out of the deal.\u201d\n\nDuring discussions, Churchill enthused about Lawrence of Arabia \u2013 \u201cwhat a commander he would have made in this war with me behind him\u201d \u2013 and confided, to Graebner\u2019s dismay, that he would have to cut criticism of Charles De Gaulle from his speeches.\n\nGraebner noted that \u201cChurchill can\u2019t speak about Dunkirk without his eyes filling with tears\u201d and writes in bed, staying up to midnight.\n\nHe learned that Churchill dictated to six secretaries working up to 16-hour shifts and could deliver 1,000 words while being driven from London to Chartwell. \u201cOne secretary told me it was hell to take down the dictation going round some of the Kentish curves,\u201d Graebner writes.\n\n\u201cI remember at one point he began to discourse on the United States of Europe and asked me whether I thought this subject would be good for Fulton,\u201d Graebner records.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Walter Graebner. Photograph: Alfred Eisenstaedt/Life Picture Collection via Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a phrase very much associated with Churchill,\u201d Toye said, \u201cbut it actually goes back to the 1860s when people like Victor Hugo were using that term.\u201d\n\nInstead Churchill decided to use Fulton to focus on the Soviet threat. \u201cHe understood the danger that the more brilliant phrases you throw in, the message becomes confused,\u201d Toye said.\n\nGraebner was a useful sounding board. \u201cHaving a day with Churchill was very often like being subjected to a series of trial speeches,\u201d Toye explained. \u201cAnd so if Graebner had said \u2018that\u2019s a fantastic idea\u2019, then maybe that would have pushed him in that direction. Churchill was floating balloons. It was probably not so much a sign of indecisiveness \u2013 he took time to make his mind up \u2013 but it was a sign of his political antennae.\u201d\n\nFor years, historians have wrestled with what Churchill would have thought about the European Union. With Europe celebrating the 75th anniversary of VE Day this weekend, many continue to argue that he would have been in favour. The fact that Churchill toyed with promoting the phrase in what is described as his most important post-war speech might give that impression.\n\nBut Toye said the truth was more nuanced. Churchill was cautious about deploying the phrase, which he had played around with since the 1930s, finally rolling it out in a lower-profile speech he delivered months later in Zurich. \u201cHe was in favour of European integration,\u201d Toye agreed. \u201cBut with Britain smiling benevolently from the sidelines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "author": ["Jamie Doward"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/israel-threatens-to-pull-evangelical-christian-tv-station-aimed-at-jews", "published": "2020-05-10T06:02:17", "title": "Israel threatens to pull evangelical Christian TV station aimed at Jews", "text": "The Israeli government is threatening to take off air a Christian television channel that launched in the country to preach to Jews, warning that it will be barred if it breaks strict rules around proselytising.\n\nGOD TV, an evangelical media network that broadcasts across the world, signed a seven-year deal with a major Israeli cable television provider, HOT, to host its new Hebrew-language channel that began airing last month.\n\nIn a video message, Ward Simpson, the CEO of God TV, said: \u201cGod has supernaturally opened the door for us to take the gospel of Jesus into the homes, and lives and hearts of his Jewish people.\u201d\n\nMany in the Jewish state see the conversion of Jews as a threat to the relatively small global population as well as their majority status within Israel.

He went to a friend whose theatre company, withWings, took inventive musical adaptations to the Edinburgh fringe. That year they were doing Le Bossu, a retelling of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Patel mentioned that he wanted to get out of his comfort zone and do some theatre. \u201cHe came back to me and said, \u2018Cool, well, I can offer you the role of a pigeon.\u2019\u201d\n\nMost actors who had spent their lives being watched by 8m viewers, four nights a week, would be unwilling to start again at the bottom rung of acting. (The pigeon was a bit part.) But Patel, now 29, leapt at the chance.\n\n\u201cAnd, honestly, playing that pigeon, for so many reasons, was one of the most important things I ever did. I remember that feeling being side of stage as the lights went down \u2013 that fear was so visceral. Then, as the run went on, it slowly ebbed away. It let me become a more extroverted performer, which set me up for what came next.\u201d\n\nWhat came next was a starring role in Danny Boyle\u2019s counter-factual caper Yesterday, in which Patel stars as Jack Malik who, after a freak thunderstorm, is the only person on earth who remembers the music of the Beatles. Malik becomes a star overnight, plays Wembley with Ed Sheeran, and is hailed as the greatest songwriter of his generation. The film transformed Patel\u2019s life with similar force. His follow-up roles have all screamed prestige: leading turns in Armando Iannucci\u2019s sci-fi spoof Avenue 5 and the BBC\u2019s adaptation of Eleanor Catton\u2019s The Luminaries, the 2013 novel, set in the New Zealand goldrush.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s the responsibility, as someone British, to say that this story about Indian soldiers is a British story\u2019: Himesh Patel.

Photograph: Dean Chalkley\n\nHe\u2019s recently arrived back from Chicago, where he shot the pilot for HBO\u2019s adaptation of Station Eleven, the Emily St John Mandel novel about, eerily, a flu pandemic that wipes out 90% of the world\u2019s population. When Patel started shooting, he was most concerned about how freezing Illinois gets in January. Then, as more news came from China, the strangeness of the situation started to sink in.\n\n\u201cThe episode we filmed was the beginning of the outbreak. It felt incredibly odd, making a show about a global pandemic, and now here we are.\u201d The oddest moment, he says, was finding out that production of a series about a pandemic was now on hold because of a pandemic.\n\nWe meet on a weekday lunchtime at a pub in Islington, London in that eerie period before the enforced lockdown when pubs and restaurants are still open but people are furiously washing their hands and firing evil glares at anyone clearing their throat. The pub has posters declaring that the toilet doors have been jammed open so you don\u2019t have to touch any handles. It means the faint sound of ablutions can be heard throughout our conversation.\n\nPatel arrives straight from the photoshoot, an experience he tentatively enjoyed. His parents own a newsagents in the small village of Sawtry, near Cambridge, and he likes knowing that they\u2019ll get the papers in one morning and see photos of him looking suave. He hasn\u2019t always been a fan of Sunday supplements. As a teenager, he had to help out his folks by doing the local paper round. Weekends, he says, were always the worst. \u201cThe papers were full of magazines! So I\u2019d have to walk up the hill, then go back down, and then go further up the hill because you can\u2019t carry them all at once.\u201d\n\nHis childhood days were crammed.\n\nAs well as school and the paper round, he went to several different drama schools. He giggles when I ask what it was that set apart the kinds of kids he met at those after-school classes. \u201cWe were all a bit odd, mimicking things we\u2019d seen on telly, creating these little pop-culture storms within our own lives. Maybe some of us were quite attention-hungry, but we were alive with this energy. It\u2019s the antithesis of a maths lesson. It\u2019s about play.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It was important for me to be on national TV and doing a paper round at the same time\u2019: Himesh Patel, with Meryl Fernandes in EastEnders. Photograph: BBC\n\nHe was 16 when a new executive producer on EastEnders, Diederick Santer, began an overhaul of the families on the soap to make it \u201cfeel more 21st century\u201d. That included introducing a Pakistani family on the show, the Masoods. Patel was nervous in the audition for Tamwar Masood and thought he\u2019d ruined his chances when he told producers he didn\u2019t really watch the show. But they saw something in him and, once on board, he went about turning Tamwar into one of the most unusual characters in soap. He was removed and analytical. He existed almost outside the show, a kind of geeky flaneur who saw the absurdity of Albert Square in the same way the audience did. In a show that\u2019s always been about dramatic bust-ups and big acting, Patel played against the action: quiet and pitying, often lingering in the back of someone else\u2019s family crisis. Patel quickly became a fan favourite. His character\u2019s marriage to Afia Khan (Meryl Fernandes) won the pair Inside Soap award for best wedding.\n\nHis parents, though proud, were also insistent that the paper round must continue. \u201cThose were the days,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d be, like, \u2018It\u2019s the weekend, I\u2019m trudging round the village in the rain, why am I having to do this?\u2019 But I look back on it fondly. It was important for me to be on national TV and be doing a paper round at the same time. It was just a daily reminder of being brought back down to earth.\u201d\n\nBy his mid-20s, Patel was beginning to look at the career paths available to him. \u201cThere\u2019s a thin line between being on a soap and being a celebrity. You often see people from EastEnders going to do I\u2019m a Celebrity or Strictly \u2013 which is great if that\u2019s what you want to do. But from going to a lot of these awards ceremonies, it wasn\u2019t somewhere I was ever going to enjoy myself.\u201d\n\nHe said the decision to leave was both easy and scary. \u201cI\u2019d been doing it since I was 16 and it was all I\u2019d known as an adult. It was a leap of faith. I remember on that last day I drove out the gates that last time, and I just thought: here we go, let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\n\nHis certainty about wanting to do something more than Strictly is the result of his particular upbringing, he says. The closest town growing up was Huntingdon, in the heart of John Major\u2019s old constituency. (Patel\u2019s mother would always point out his house when they drove past.) He didn\u2019t have any traumatic experiences of racism growing up, \u201cbut there were very few people who looked like me and there is a part of you that you consciously or subconsciously dilute in order to fit in. There are a lot of feelings that I grew up with that I later started to realise I wasn\u2019t alone in feeling, and that perhaps there\u2019s something to be done about that.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guitar man: in Yesterday. Photograph: Jonathan Prime/AP\n\nHis adolescence left him with a dogged feeling of responsibility \u2013 to make it easier for the next generation of kids like him. He talks about \u201cresponsibility\u201d a lot. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s the responsibility, as someone British, to say: \u2018This is also British, the story that I\u2019m telling you about my parents, or Indian soldiers that fought in the world wars.\u2019 These stories are also British. At a time when people want to limit the idea of Britishness, physically speaking, I think I\u2019d quite like to broaden it.\u201d\n\nHe gives the example of Britain\u2019s colonial history in India, something he feels mainstream Britain has never properly wrestled with. \u201cWe watched a lot of Indian movies growing up, and every now and then there\u2019d be one about British rule, but I never really learned about that in school. So there was a disconnect between these films I was watching, set during a very turbulent time in India\u2019s history, and school, where we might be taught that Gandhi was a liberator, but not what he was liberating from.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not angry at people who haven\u2019t taken the time to learn that history, he says, but he sees his role as bringing those stories to them. He talks about watching Saving Private Ryan in history class, how it brought to life a war he would have otherwise struggled to imagine. \u201cOne of the most powerful ways of finding out about stuff is TV and film. If I can, in my current position, get the ball rolling on some of those stories then I\u2019d really like to do that.\u201d (He says he has writing and acting projects in the works that would fulfil that brief.)\n\nIt\u2019s a sense of duty that imbues much of Patel\u2019s life. Even when we\u2019re talking about The Luminaries, in which he plays Emery Staines, a young prospector, conversation veers back to the importance of minority stories in national history. During the six months he spent in New Zealand filming the show, which will air later this year, he was impressed by the public\u2019s understanding of a wide range of historical events. \u201cI fell in love with the culture. For a country that was a colonial outpost, as it were, they\u2019ve really made efforts to integrate the indigenous M\u0101ori culture. The country is not without its troubles, but we went up to Waitangi, where the British signed a treaty with the M\u0101ori, and even just tiny gestures, like the signs being both in English and in M\u0101ori. A lot of people who I met who were not of M\u0101ori descent were just as aware of that history, which was commendable.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Costume drama: with Eve Hewson in The Luminaries. Photograph: BBC\n\nOne concrete change he is trying to make is through his membership of Bafta, which was heavily criticised for all-white shortlists in a number of award categories. Patel was one of several actors who offered alternative shortlists in protest: \u201cThe oddity for me is how an amazing film such as Parasite did so well and yet none of the actors got nominated.\u201d\n\nI ask whether he ever feels annoyed having to hand over his annual Bafta membership fee (not cheap at \u00a3495), when the awards fail to recognise diverse talent again and again. Does there ever come a point where the institutions themselves should be left to fail?\n\n\u201cI know some people feel like that, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m there yet because the impact of things like the Baftas is still huge. I grew up in a rural place, naive to how a lot of the industry works. For me watching the Baftas was a big deal. When Slumdog Millionaire won all those awards I thought, wow it\u2019s relevant on that level. So now I\u2019m a member I want to change things from the inside.\u201d\n\nPatel has a persistent seriousness about him. His manner is more that of an activist: dogged and thoughtful. The paper round, the pigeon, the desire to make movies that get shown in a classroom\u2026 it all reflects a person entirely uninterested in flashness. We all want to be seen as compassionate, but surely he has moments of indulging his new wealth and celebrity? What\u2019s been his most lavish purchase?\n\n\u201cMmm, well recently I kept seeing Teslas everywhere, so I did have a brief look at their website kind of going, \u2018Well, it\u2019s good for the planet isn\u2019t it?\u2019 But it is still very expensive. And I live in London, so I don\u2019t need a car.\u201d Instead, he says, he bought a new camera. \u201cMy dad always had cameras around. I like the very quiet way of saying things through photography. There\u2019s something about the ambiguity, and the silence of a photo...\u201d I am convinced, with the sombreness of this remark, this is the real Himesh.\n\nThe Luminaries will screen on BBC Two later this year\n\nGrooming by Petra Sellge at The Wall Group using Living Proof; photographer\u2019s assistant Harry Brayne; fashion assistant Peter Bevan; shot at Big Sky Studios\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Allin-Khan reported that the government\u2019s failures were contributing to a greater loss of life and she wanted answers on its testing strategy.

He didn\u2019t like the content, so instead felt it easier to make a derogatory comment towards me.\u201d\n\nAllin-Khan says she is used to confounding people. Her mother is Polish and her father is Pakistani and she grew up in a poor household in the constituency she now represents as \u201ca proud British Muslim\u201d. She describes her upbringing as \u201cdifficult \u2026 turbulent\u201d.\n\nShe won\u2019t elaborate out of sensitivity towards her parents, except to say it meant \u201cI failed my A-levels spectacularly\u201d. Nonetheless, at 24, Allin-Khan ended up reading medicine at Cambridge and gained a masters in public health before working as a doctor in disaster zones across the world.\n\n\u201cPeople are still confused by who I am or what I am,\u201d she says, of the layers of ignorance she has navigated her whole life. \u201cThe biggest learning journey I have had as a politician is seeing how much I can be hated for being eastern European, for being Pakistani, for being Muslim. I never came from a political background. The vitriol shocked me.\u201d\n\nAt 42, alongside her constituency work, Allin-Khan serves as a shadow cabinet minister for mental health and is an amateur boxer, wife, and mother to two children under six. She stopped her campaign for Labour\u2019s deputy leadership in March and then went to work treating Covid-19 patients at St George\u2019s hospital in south London and at the newly opened Nightingale. The experience has been harrowing and frightening.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Frontline doctors face the heartbreak of passing on \u2018goodbye messages\u2019 from loved ones to patients dying of Covid-19, says Dr Allin-Khan. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\n\u201cFamilies are begging me for a miracle I can\u2019t give them. You\u2019re unable to console them with a hug or a touch on the shoulder. You have to watch their hearts break, you\u2019re the one delivering goodbye messages to their loved ones,\u201d Allin-Khan takes a pause. \u201cMessages like \u2018please hold on, Dad\u2019, \u2018please hold on for the kids\u2019 \u2013 it puts chills through your body but you have to hold it together and stay strong for these families. It is very hard to do.\u201d\n\nAt home, her children have been taught not to run to her until she has stripped her clothes into the washing machine and showered. She uses separate cutlery, crockery and towels from her family and has found herself in tears \u201cwondering about how many of all those deaths could have been avoided\u201d. She has found the clapping for key workers \u201ca wonderful way for communities to feel they are supporting frontline staff. It\u2019s an opportunity to say thank you\u201d. But she is scornful that it is \u201ca pointless exercise if government ministers clap, but don\u2019t provide resources the NHS needs\u201d.\n\nAllin-Khan became a Labour councillor during her first maternity leave in 2014, winning \u201cin a local ward that had been Conservative for 24 years\u201d. Two years later, just after the birth of her second child, Sadiq Khan left his Tooting seat to become mayor of London and Allin-Khan was encouraged to stand.\n\nThere were 119 candidates up for selection and she found the campaign gruelling; the Daily Mail published old photos of her in a bikini, claiming that the working-class doctor had in fact been a secret swimwear model with \u201ca glamorous past\u201d. At the time, she was distraught. \u201cThat people would be out there trying to tarnish my character over something that wasn\u2019t true and deliberately using my ethnicity and religion to try and humiliate me was upsetting. It can be all-consuming.\u201d But she says she kept on \u201cbecause I have a work ethic that means that once I commit to doing something, I give 2,000%\u201d.\n\nI can use my platform to be a voice for the voiceless\n\nAllin-Khan was elected the day MP Jo Cox was murdered in 2016. \u201cIt was horrific,\u201d she says flatly, at the time unsure of what she had got herself into.\n\nAllin-Khan claims not to have any political heroes \u2013 \u201cmine are more everyday heroes\u201d \u2013 but says she became more interested in politics at university. \u201cThe Labour party did change my life and gave me opportunities that wouldn\u2019t have happened under the status quo,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been possible for someone with a background like mine to have gone to medical school otherwise.\u201d\n\nWitnessing the erosion of the health service firsthand has been a prime motivator for her political energy. \u201cI am so grateful to be doing the work I always did, but now I have MP after my name and suddenly people are interested. I can use my platform to be a voice for the voiceless.\u201d\n\nIt is indisputable to Allin-Khan that coronavirus has escalated a system already in crisis. \u201cUncertainty breeds anxiety. Labour wants to support the government to get this right. Our priority is protecting public health, but we do need a consensus on what happens next.\u201d Is there a sense that criticism has been tempered in the Commons chamber for the sake of fostering national unity?\n\n\u201cNobody likes political point-scoring, but it is a challenge not to be able to scrutinise decisions that affect the whole country. Things like Boris Johnson announcing a press conference on Sunday to decide the future of the country? That sort of announcement should be made in parliament where there can be due diligence and scrutiny.\u201d\n\nThe Public Health England review into why so many BAME people are dying disproportionately from Covid-19 fills her with similar frustration. \u201cI have reservations about the review and how it will be conducted.\u201d Referring to the controversial appointment to the review of Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission who has been suspended from the Labour party over allegations of Islamophobia, she says: \u201cWe need to have trust in this review. Our BAME communities deserve it.\u201d\n\nAllin-Khan says she was underestimated at the beginning of her political career, but that it only fuelled her to keep going. \u201cI\u2019m an ordinary woman living an extraordinary life, and I am driven very much by what is right and what is wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I lose my seat tomorrow, I will have been grateful to have represented my community and saved as many lives as I could. That\u2019s why when Matt Hancock said what he said, I just thought no. No, I won\u2019t watch my tone \u2013 I\u2019ve got something I need to say.\u201d", "author": ["Nosheen Iqbal"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/10/what-does-it-take-to-get-really-great-service-in-restaurants-dont-be-a-schmuck", "published": "2020-05-10T05:00:16", "title": "What does it take to get really great service in restaurants?", "text": "In the opening chapter of Wine Girl, the hugely entertaining memoir by Victoria James, once America\u2019s youngest sommelier, the author describes a blood-boiling encounter with the kind of customer for whom involuntary euthanasia should be devised. It is a Monday lunch at the glossy Aureole in New York and the host of a testicle-heavy table of four has ordered a $650 bottle of a serious white burgundy (a 2009 Chevalier-Montrachet from Domaine Ramonet).\n\nHaving checked at her serving station that the wine isn\u2019t tainted, James returns to the table and pours a small measure for the customer to taste. He declares it corked. \u201cI think she has too much perfume in her nose, this girl\u2026\u201d he says, as if competing for a gold in the misogyny Olympics. There are only two bottles of the wine in the restaurant\u2019s cellar. James does not want to waste a big-bucks bottle when she knows it is perfectly fine. Instead, she presents the unopened second bottle, takes it away, then returns and gets him to taste the original bottle again. And between racist epithets, he declares it perfect, with a fat top note of triumph in his voice. Witness: small penis energy.\n\nGood service is about being present, noticing what\u2019s happening and anticipating what\u2019s needed Paulo de Tarso\n\nHere\u2019s what this story tells us: the customer is not always right. Indeed, sometimes the customer is a total and utter schmuck. In the depths of lockdown many of us talk wistfully about the restaurants to which we would like to return. Often, we frame it around the joys of a certain dish; the slow-cooked, deep-glazed, nurtured and stroked perfect little something that wafts us to our happy place. In truth, however, it\u2019s the whole package we\u2019re after. And front and centre of that has to be service.\n\nWe can frame this in purely mercenary terms: I give you money: you make me feel good about myself. But how reductive and grubby is that? There are personal services that work in this manner, but you\u2019ll need a shower afterwards and, anyway, you\u2019ll rarely be offered them in a restaurant, or at least not the sort of restaurants this column has visited. One of the questions I\u2019m asked most regularly, after: \u201cWhere can I take my parents for dinner in Nuneaton that will impress them?\u201d is: \u201cHow do I get great service?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Soho memories: Elena Salvoni, legendary ma\u00eetre d\u2019 of Elena\u2019s L\u2019Etoile, with Sean Connery. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nTo answer that we first have to understand what great service is. It is not about putting up with self-important men being abusive just because they\u2019re buying 75cl of Burgundy\u2019s finest. It\u2019s also not about the placing of a plate on the table from a particular side, or the clearing of dishes in good time, although those are all a part of it. Brazilian-born Paulo de Tarso, owner of the blissfully comfortable, gloriously upholstered Italian restaurant Margot in London\u2019s Covent Garden, where life is always amber-toned and lovely, ran front of house at Bar Boulud and worked at the Wolseley and Scott\u2019s among many others. Margot is one of the places I spend my own money, because I feel not just looked after, but held.\n\nI ask him to define good service. \u201cIt\u2019s about being present, noticing what\u2019s happening and anticipating what\u2019s needed,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with someone when they arrive. They might be happy or they might be rude in lots of different ways, because of something that\u2019s happened to them that day.\u201d It is, he says, about \u201ctaking away the stresses\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Sometimes terrific service is sleight of hand\u2019: Michel Roux Jr with Silvano Giraldin at Le Gavroche. Photograph: Edward Lloyd/Alpha\n\nI ask if these skills can be taught. Can anyone be good at service? Yes, he says. \u201cBut you need to have empathy.\u201d Here\u2019s a story of great service (which I\u2019ve told before, but it deserves repeating). A friend took a date to Elena\u2019s L\u2019Etoile on Charlotte Street. It was named after Elena Salvoni, the legendary ma\u00eetre d\u2019 who had run the dining rooms of some of Soho\u2019s most famous restaurants, including Bianchi\u2019s and L\u2019Escargot before landing here. She was pretty much still working until her death in 2016, aged 95.\n\nEarly on in the date, my friend started surreptitiously patting his trouser pockets. A waiter tapped him on the shoulder. He had a telephone call at the front desk. (Yes, it was that long ago.) The chap was baffled. Few people knew where he was that evening. When he got to reception, he found Elena, perched as always on her stool, watching the room, missing nothing. She said: \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten your wallet, haven\u2019t you?\u201d He agreed that he had. That was what he had been searching his pockets for. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said. \u201cPay me tomorrow. Go enjoy your dinner.\u201d\n\nSometimes terrific service is a sleight of hand. It is the magnificent Silvano Giraldin, at Le Gavroche, taking my order with an encouraging grin on his face, his hands clasped behind his back. He is so compelling that I do not notice the commis waiter four feet away listening in and taking my order. Great service is a young woman called Emma at Albert\u2019s Schloss in Manchester who, amid the battering clamour of rowdy jazz and lip-syncing drag queens, still knows exactly when to be there and when not to be there. It is the front-of-house team at Frankie\u2019s Italian Bar and Grill who \u2019fess up to having run out of buns for a burger, but then pull it all back by apologising, comping the replacement main course and the desserts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Great service is knowing exactly when to be there and when not to be there\u2019: staff at Albert\u2019s Schloss. Photograph: Rebecca Lupton\n\nSo how, when restaurants reopen for business \u2013 and forgive me, but I have to retain the sweet, stubborn, perhaps deluded belief that they all shall \u2013 how do we, the customers, get the best service? Here are my tips. First, avoid empty dining rooms. Restaurants function best when they are busy. The fewer guests there are, the slower and more sloppily things move. Secondly, if you really want good service, become a regular. That\u2019s not as onerous as it might sound. Go to a restaurant once and you\u2019re just another punter. Turn up three times in a month and now you are why the business exists. It means you must really like being there. Or as Paulo de Tarso puts it: \u201cIf you become a regular, you become part of the family. And that\u2019s what the best restaurants are \u2013 families.\u201d And if something goes wrong, don\u2019t sit there fuming about it. Explain gently what\u2019s happened as soon as it\u2019s happened and see if they can put it right.\n\nFinally, first impressions count. \u201cBe super nice when you arrive,\u201d De Tarso says, \u201cbecause that spreads around the room very quickly. By the time you\u2019re seated, everyone will know.\u201d There\u2019s another way of putting this. Don\u2019t be like Victoria James\u2019s dreary, self-important, high-rolling wine buyer. Don\u2019t be a dick. It\u2019s really very simple.\n\nNews bites\n\nThe closure of restaurants has left a lot of restaurant-grade ingredients with nowhere to go. The group behind Zelman Meats, the steakhouse Goodman and Burger & Lobster has turned to delivery. They are offering high-end \u2018feast boxes\u2019. The 2kg box contains a 400g ribeye, a 650g porterhouse, two short ribs (pre-cooked, just in need of finishing), the makings of two burgers plus myriad sauces including their truffle steak and their stilton steak sauces, all for \u00a390. You can also add king crab legs and top wines. It\u2019s delivered across London and the home counties. Visit primefeast.co.uk.\n\nMeanwhile, if you\u2019re after fish Marisco Fish of Penzance are now delivering to homes across the UK. They offer a wide selection including fresh brill, black bream, various sole and John Dory as well as frozen seafood. There\u2019s a hamper at \u00a355, or you can put together your own order, mariscofishltd.co.uk.\n\nLots of restaurant operations have moved to selling food to eat at home. A reader directed me towards Csons in Ludlow and Shrewsbury. They\u2019re offering a changing range of dishes to be finished at home, both for collection and delivery. The menu includes the likes of asparagus and beetroot with a sauce of wild garlic and jack by the hedge, a lamb tagine, and their locally renowned burger. The website includes videos on how to finish the dishes csons-ludlow.co.uk\n\nEmail Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1", "author": ["Jay Rayner"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/10/through-my-lockdown-lens-11-leading-photographers-capture-their-confinement", "published": "2020-05-10T06:00:17", "title": "Through my lockdown lens: 11 leading photographers capture their confinement", "text": "Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Alec Soth/Magnum Photos\n\nA leading chronicler of contemporary American life, Magnum photographer Alec Soth is renowned for his images of disconnected communities in the US. Born and based in Minneapolis, he has published more than 25 books and received a Guggenheim fellowship in 2013\n\nLast year, I began a correspondence with a man who has been in prison since 2003. His letters have taken on new meaning in the wake of the pandemic and the \u201cstay at home\u201d orders. While I would never compare these constraints to incarceration, his words are nonetheless helpful. \u201cIt all boils down to limits,\u201d he recently wrote. \u201cWhether enforced by nature \u2013 biologic or social, tangible or abstractions \u2013 we all confront the parameters of our cage eventually. What we do when we reach those bars helps define us.\u201d\n\nAs a photographer I\u2019m really struggling to respond to the pandemic, because I\u2019m not a crisis-response type photographer. I\u2019ve done little photographic experiments, and they\u2019ve been OK. But by far the most meaningful thing that\u2019s happened to me is this letter exchange. In terms of the image itself, I just took a picture of the letter with my iPhone, using the screen on my bedroom window to make the writing illegible, though a few words pop out here and there. I really do find it interesting to reflect on the constraints of prison, which are a million times worse than what I\u2019m going through, and all the psychological weight of incarceration that you can\u2019t even imagine.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m rattling my cage at the moment, but it\u2019s so not a cage. I\u2019m in a city but it\u2019s very spread out. I have a studio, which I have no problem getting to. I\u2019m biking a lot \u2013 thank God it\u2019s spring because Minnesota is the coldest part of the US and winters here are brutal. It\u2019s a distressing time, but really my life is not so very different at all. KF\n\nFolkestone, Kent\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dandelion honey. Photograph: Vanessa Winship\n\nLincolnshire-born Vanessa Winship explores concepts of borders, identity and memory in her work, which was the subject of a major exhibition at the Barbican in 2018\n\nBefore lockdown a friend sent me a link to a recipe for making vegan honey. All you need is fresh dandelion flowers, sugar, a lemon and water. She suggested that perhaps it was something I could do with my granddaughter, Bella, because she knows we like making things together and doing things outside. Bella is six. In normal times we see each other quite a lot but because we\u2019re trying to obey the lockdown rules I haven\u2019t seen her for many weeks.\n\nDandelions started to appear opposite my house and along the path where I take my daily walk, so even though I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be making the honey with her, I picked them and I\u2019m planning to follow the recipe. I\u2019m not vegan and neither is she but that is irrelevant, really \u2013 I just know it is something she would have loved to do.\n\nIt was a coincidence that the cloth on our kitchen table the day I gathered the dandelions happened to have a pattern on it that looks like a beehive. But coincidence is a fantastic thing and I like it when it comes into my work.\n\nI\u2019ve been talking to Bella on Zoom and WhatsApp and because she is a child of the digital age she is very comfortable with that but I can\u2019t go outside with her and pick dandelions so the act of doing that by myself felt like a lovely link with her. What\u2019s really nice as well is that dandelions represent the sun and, in fact, yellow is her favourite colour. I also like the idea that after dandelions are dandelions they become clocks that we blow as a game, counting down the days to the end of our confinement.

Photograph: \u00a9 Nadav Kander Courtesy Flowers Gallery\n\nWinner of the outstanding contribution to photography prize at the 2019 Sony world photography awards, Nadav Kander is an acclaimed landscape and portrait photographer\n\nAt the beginning of lockdown, my kneejerk reaction was to come to my studio, set things up and immediately start working. I realised quite quickly that this was an internal pressure I was putting on myself, it wasn\u2019t organic or authentic. I needed more time to process what I was feeling. I knew it was around solitude and touch but I wanted just to spend some weeks digesting it and then see how it comes out in my work rather than pushing.\n\nPart of that process was to bring a camera home and start looking more carefully at my house, turning my eyes on, in a way, and looking more deeply at my surroundings. I started taking pictures inside the house and spent a lot of time looking out of various windows at the plain blue sky without any streaks. One day we had this rainbow and I happened to notice it through the blind.\n\nI find it quite a gentle, poignant image. I like the way the blind drawn between inside and outside asks questions rather than answers them. The clear view would have been less ambiguous, I guess. This is veiled \u2013 I think that makes it more alluring.\n\nWhen lockdown was announced all my projects and the work I had just absolutely evaporated. But in many ways this period has been amazing, not frustrating. There are six of us at home \u2013 I have four children aged from 24 to 20 \u2013 and I feel very privileged to spend this time with them. I\u2019m actually in my element. I like everything being slower and having time to think and look. I feel more sorry for my children than myself: I think they are bursting to get out and hug people, see people and socialise. LO\u2019K\n\nDublin\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Untitled. Photograph: Eamonn Doyle\n\nA record label owner and DJ, Eamonn Doyle returned to photography in 2008, focusing on working-class life on Dublin\u2019s north side. Martin Parr called Doyle\u2019s 2014 book, i, \u201cthe best street photobook in a decade\u201d\n\nJust before the pandemic hit, my dad died after a short illness. While the lockdown was going on, I decided to move to his house in Sandycove, south Dublin, to be near my little nephew, who lives next door. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve lived out here since the late 80s, and I\u2019ve been taking a lot of photographs around the house where I grew up, which is up the road in Killiney. I\u2019ve been craving to go back into that house for decades and I\u2019d love to photograph it. In the meantime, I\u2019ve been wandering around the area, within two or three roads of the house, just photographing odd things \u2013 lampposts, markings on the ground, some surreal hedges \u2013 for a short-form publication.\n\nThere was something about this trolley that drew me in, I\u2019m not sure what: the particular light, the wall behind it, the direction of the wheels\u2026 There aren\u2019t really any supermarkets nearby \u2013 the nearest Tesco is a couple of kilometres away \u2013 so somebody must have pushed it quite a bit. It\u2019s not part of a narrative or anything. I was just in the mode of focusing on singular objects.\n\nThe lockdown has been fine for me. In terms of my day-to-day, it\u2019s been really nice to be out here by the sea, walking around, but I\u2019m very aware that it\u2019s a very unrealistic, unsustainable situation. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going through any heavy grieving or anything \u2013 the overriding emotion is one of absolute relief that my dad isn\u2019t dying in hospital right now. That would have been so much worse. KF\n\nChiba prefecture, near Tokyo\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Rinko Kawauchi\n\nBorn in Shiga prefecture, Rinko Kawauchi is renowned for her intimate, dream-like images of family life and religious activity in Japan\n\nThis is a photograph of my daughter and my friend\u2019s son. They are both three years old and they are looking for an insect in my back yard. It was taken 17 days before the Japanese government announced a state of emergency [on 16 April]. It was the last day of having time together with my friends before lockdown. The children are a metaphor of our future and I hope that future will be surrounded by brightness and light.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis has reminded me of the Fukushima nuclear disaster nine years ago. I was living in Tokyo when it happened and I couldn\u2019t walk outside at that time. It\u2019s a different situation now, but I had a similar feeling that the world I live in was changing in a big way.\n\nI haven\u2019t been taking many photographs during the lockdown, apart from at home and at my neighbour\u2019s house. Instead, I\u2019ve been reading books, watching movies and thinking about my new work, as well as doing some printing in my darkroom. It\u2019s a good opportunity to catch up on things like that. KF\n\nTeju Cole\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Teju Cole\n\nTeju Cole is a Nigerian-American writer, photographer and critic, whose genre-crossing book Blind Spot was shortlisted for the 2017 Aperture/Paris photobook award\n\nI\u2019m a photographer and I\u2019m a writer, and I keep trying to bring those two things together. One of my ambitions in my photography is to make pictures that look like they were taken by a writer, but in a good way. They\u2019re not just pure emotion, they\u2019re constructed.\n\nI took this image in Cambridge, Massachusetts, within walking distance of my house. What drew me to the scene was the ladders. Ladders are a recurring theme in my work. They are full of metaphorical intensity: a ladder can take you up, but it can also bring you down. And, of course, in many religious positions, ladders suggest heaven. So I walk by this blue house and there\u2019s four ladders \u2013 it\u2019s slight ladder overkill. I tried to see what was going on and I saw the man and took a photo.\n\nThat was my initial attraction. But once he turned around something had changed, because he was wearing a mask. And I was wearing a mask. The usual element of surveillance that we get in street photography has gone away because I couldn\u2019t identify him. He couldn\u2019t identify me. But a new tension had entered the exchange and that new tension felt to me like a new language that we were all learning to speak at the same time. There is also this cascade of association of what it means when somebody covers their face, and I thought about The Beekeepers and the Birdnester, a drawing by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.\n\nEmotionally, this is a particularly difficult time to do work. It\u2019s not like: \u201cOh, it\u2019s a wonderful vacation!\u201d I\u2019m not sitting here writing King Lear. I cannot have that blithe attitude to it, because thousands of people are dying every day. But I think the images I\u2019ve made in the past six weeks have had even more focus and tension than they usually do. And tension is usually what I\u2019m looking for when I choose a photograph. TL\n\nBrighton\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Liz Johnson Artur\n\nGhanaian-Russian photographer Liz Johnson Artur documents the lives of people from the African diaspora. Her first solo show spanning three decades of work ran at the Brooklyn Museum last year\n\nI\u2019m based in London, but I live in Brighton with my family, and a couple of days before lockdown, I decided that probably London wasn\u2019t the place to be. So I went to Brighton. April was a very beautiful month in terms of the weather and this picture was taken in my garden there.\n\nThe image is by a photographer called Peter Basch, a German \u00e9migr\u00e9 who lived in New York. He did a series of photographs of women in the 1960s, which he called \u201cexotic beauties\u201d. So I was looking at this book and it was badly bound and very windy in the garden, and suddenly all the pages flew off. While I was collecting them, I thought they actually looked quite nice in the garden. There\u2019s a lot of poetry in real life: sometimes it\u2019s there simply by picking something up and combining it with something else that you wouldn\u2019t usually combine it with.\n\nThe work that I do as an artist and as a photographer has a lot to do with black and brown representation. On one side, I was aesthetically attracted by Basch\u2019s photographs, but at the same time, I was also irritated by the whole \u201cexotic beauties\u201d setup of the book. This picture felt like a way to give these \u201cexotic beauties\u201d my own kind of interpretation.\n\nIt\u2019s a very painful time, and the people that I like to represent are especially affected. But there\u2019s a certain luxury for me in being able to slow down and look at things without any time pressure. In Brighton, I have a 35mm camera and black-and-white film. That\u2019s all I need. Big plans at the moment are hard to accomplish, so I like the idea of small steps and small gestures. This picture is part of that.

Photograph: Newsha Tavakolian/Magnum Photos\n\nThe Iranian Magnum photojournalist is renowned for her coverage of conflict and social issues across the Middle East\n\nIran was one of the first countries to be hit by coronavirus after China, so I wanted to show the outside world my experience of day-to-day life in self-quarantine. Stuck at home, you become more sensitive about details you might otherwise miss. For 17 years, I have been looking at this view of a lampshade at my home in Tehran, but I never thought of taking a picture of it. One night I was bored by myself and I was playing with my camera. I wanted to smoke, so I flicked on my lighter and noticed how the flame lined up nicely with the light from the bulb.\n\nMy father passed away exactly a year before this was taken. We were meant to have a big ceremony for the anniversary, but we had to cancel it at the last minute. Instead, my mother, my sister and I went to the cemetery to visit his grave. I was shocked by how quiet it was \u2013 we were completely on our own. Then I came home and I was wondering: is this the new normal? It\u2019s like a scary film we are living. Fortunately or unfortunately, nearly two months later, I\u2019ve kind of got used to it. When I want to visit my mother, who lives close by, I put on my face mask without thinking.\n\nIf I can say one thing to other photographers and artists , it\u2019s that they must act before this lifestyle becomes normal. Now is the best time to do projects, because everything is new. You\u2019ve got to capture that before you lose your appetite.

Photograph: Giles Duley\n\nA documentary photographer focusing on the long-term impact of war, Giles Duley is a triple amputee after stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan\n\nThis is the view from my window. Every day since lockdown began I\u2019ve been walking across the road in front of my house and sitting on the bench on the other side to do this kind of meditation for 20 minutes, get my fresh air for the day and take a photograph of the sea.\n\nI moved to live by the sea 20 years ago because when I\u2019m working I am normally in conflict zones, which are tense and stressful places, so when I come back I need peace and I find the sea really helpful. I am not sure if the sea reflects my mood or the mood of the sea is reflected in me but there is definitely a reciprocity of some kind. Often I\u2019ll wake up feeling a bit flat and I look at the sea and find it is a bit flat and grey too. This picture was taken on one of those days.\n\nI\u2019m in isolation on my own. It would be nice to have company but I guess photographers are loners by nature. I\u2019ve been cooking relentlessly \u2013 it\u2019s my way to relax \u2013 and the button burst off my trousers last week, so I\u2019ll have to watch that.\n\nI\u2019m spending the rest of the time trying to be useful. Through the charity I run, Legacy of War Foundation, I\u2019ve set up a group called Hastings Supports the NHS and we\u2019ve been providing free transport for NHS staff, buying PPE and hand sanitisers for them. It\u2019s been great because the whole community has got involved.\n\nWe\u2019re going to auction a print of this photograph to raise more money. I still shoot on film, and by chance one of the world\u2019s best darkroom printers, Robin Bell, lives around the corner from me. So I left the roll of film on my windowsill, and he popped around to collect it and brought back this print a few hours later. LO\u2019K\n\nLondon\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Alys Tomlinson\n\nNamed photographer of the year at the 2018 Sony world photography awards, Alys Tomlinson studied anthropology as well as photography. Her 2019 book, Ex Voto, explores Christian pilgrimages\n\nSince the lockdown, I haven\u2019t felt really that inspired to take pictures. Then the other night, I realised I hadn\u2019t been out after dark for over a month. So I decided to go for some night wanders. The American photographer Robert Adams did a series of nightscapes in the 1970s called Summer Nights, Walking. I\u2019ve always really admired that work so I thought I\u2019d explore the area around where I live, in Holloway, north London.\n\nThis photograph was taken around 10.30pm on a housing estate near the Emirates Stadium. The day had been warm, but the evening was chilly and there was a strong breeze. So you had the trees blowing, which is quite atmospheric, and then the warmth and pockets of light in the windows of the people getting ready for bed or having a late dinner. Most of my recent work has been shot in black-and-white, although this was digital, because I normally use an old-fashioned 5x4 plate camera. I might have been arrested if I\u2019d got that out.\n\nI was surprised, because it felt eerie and quite unsettling. I\u2019ve lived in London for more than 20 years and never really felt unsafe, but I didn\u2019t really enjoy it, and that probably sums up how I was feeling at that particular moment. There were people lurking in the shadows and it felt odd to be in a neighbourhood I\u2019m so familiar with yet not feel comfortable.\n\nAfter the lockdown is over, I\u2019ll probably look more towards stories around me. In the past, I\u2019ve never felt that inspired by what\u2019s on my doorstep, but you don\u2019t have to go to the Amazon or Antarctica to make interesting pictures. Also, photographers are all going to be completely skint, so we won\u2019t be able to afford to go away anyway! TL\n\nLondon\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Self portrait at the time of Covid-19 using i-Phone pano settings. Photograph: Chris Steele-Perkins\n\nMagnum photographer Chris Steele-Perkins published The Teds, his seminal book on teddy boys, in 1979. He has photographed conflict and deprivation all over the globe, winning the Robert Capa Gold Medal in 1988\n\nI took this self-portrait using the panoramic setting on my iPhone. I rigged up the phone so that it would rotate, and then I jumped in front of the lens and followed it as it moved, turning my head and pulling faces. I had no real control over the outcome, which I found interesting. Sometimes it misses you entirely, and it does strange things to your face. There\u2019s a brutal ugliness about it, and a randomness, which is what\u2019s so freaky about coronavirus \u2013 anybody could be struck down for any reason, almost.\n\nWhen the pandemic started, I didn\u2019t really want to go out, because I\u2019m at risk myself, in principle, and there was nothing I really wanted to document as a documentary photographer. This series (out of more than 150 photos, I got six that I\u2019m happy with) seems like a valid record of this time and how I\u2019m feeling. It expresses some sense of dread, or at least unease.\n\nI\u2019m not feeling like that all the time, thank God, though I\u2019ve had some pretty bleak moments late at night, thinking what else could go wrong with this whole situation. I\u2019m at home in south London, but my wife, who is Japanese, is in Japan. I was meant to be going over there too, but we left it a bit late. I call her every day. Actually, that\u2019s what I\u2019m using my camera for more than anything else: I\u2019ll go out and photograph the garden and then send her an image and say: \u201cHere\u2019s the magnolia coming out.\u201d It\u2019s an alternative to taking photos of my monstrous face.

We ask devotees how they\u2019ll cope without it \u2013 and why the event has such significance for the gay community\n\nThey say you never forget your first time, and Paul Jordan is no exception. It was a Saturday night, 15 May 1993, to be precise. Downstairs at his family home in Peterborough, his mum and dad were holding a dinner party. Their son, meanwhile, had sneaked into his parents\u2019 bedroom, desperate not to attract the attention of the grown-ups.\n\nA few hours later, emotions overwhelmed him. His dad came up to check on his son and when the bedroom door burst open, their eyes met as the credits rolled on the small television set. The Eurovision Song Contest was over, and after a nail-biting finish to voting, the United Kingdom\u2019s contestant had missed out on first place in the final round.\n\nWhat started as a childhood obsession for Jordan later became all-consuming. It was the subject of his undergraduate dissertation, closely followed by a PhD on how different countries attribute their own meaning to the contest. He joined the competition\u2019s comms team for a while, earning the nickname \u201cDr Eurovision\u201d for turning the pop culture phenomenon into an intellectual pursuit.\n\nTwenty-seven years later, clutching a glass of prosecco in his Northampton living room, the 36-year-old laughs as he retells the story via Zoom to a group of fellow Eurovision fanatics. \u201cWhen he heard me cheering,\u201d says Jordan, \u201cDad just assumed I was watching Match of the Day.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a memory that resonates with his friends who have logged in from across Europe for their regular lockdown catch-up: Simon in Brussels, Elaine in Dunfermline and Dan in rural south Wales. Each has their own similar tale to tell of watching for the first time.\n\nBut this digital get-together isn\u2019t just for reminiscing. It\u2019s 7.45pm and in a few minutes the opening titles of their beloved Eurovision will appear on their screens once again. Except this year\u2019s contest in Rotterdam has been cancelled due to Covid-19; the 2020 instalment was due to take place on 16 May. For superfans across Europe and beyond, this is simply a minor detail that they refuse to let stand in their way. It\u2019s why Jordan and his friends have instead turned to collective viewings of reruns.\n\nFor a week, I\u2019ve been joining the online viewing parties and Eurovision quiz nights that the competition\u2019s fans have been hosting. I\u2019ve listened to specially curated Spotify playlists; attempted to keep up with the hundreds of messages \u2013 \u201cUgh my ovaries\u201d; \u201cQUEEEEN\u201d; \u201cI\u2019ve got literal goose bumps\u201d \u2013 appearing on WhatsApp group chats that have welcomed me in. I wanted to find out how fans were coping with Eurovision being cancelled, and what gap this leaves in their lives.\n\nSo tonight I\u2019m joining in with #eurovision again: a DIY weekly YouTube streaming of one of the competition\u2019s vintage years. Since lockdown started, it has been trending on Twitter every Saturday night. This evening it\u2019s 1997 \u2013 I\u2019m told it\u2019s a treat. \u201cNone of us knew each other when this one happened,\u201d Jordan says, interrupting an introduction from a youthful-looking Ronan Keating. \u201cWe\u2019re able to experience this together in a way we haven\u2019t before.\u201d\n\nEurovision has come a long way since its inaugural 1956 event in Switzerland. Back then, seven countries played two songs each accompanied by a live orchestra: a joint venture to harness the power of newly perfected long distance broadcasting technology while attempting to unite a fractured Europe still recovering from the wounds of war.\n\n\u201cWhat makes Eurovision so special is its legacy,\u201d explains Jon Ola Sand, the contest\u2019s executive supervisor. \u201cIt would be impossible to pitch the show to broadcasters now.\u201d But, he says, its heritage and history make it work. \u201cAnd because it travels from Moscow to Dublin, Athens to Helsinki, it has established itself as a true European project, every year a different country adds a new tone.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The biggest shame is that it\u2019s the one time we get to see our family from across Europe.\u2019 Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty Images\n\nSince the 1950s it has grown in every conceivable way. Last year, more than 180 million people tuned in to watch 26 countries battle it out in the glitzy grand final. With Brexit now under way, Eurovision has taken on a new significance for many British viewers \u2013 our participation is one of the few public examples of pan-European co-operation in which we will still partake.\n\nFrom low-key beginnings, it has become a huge event; planning for the next contest starts the moment the last one finishes. The rules dictate that the winning country plays host the following May. Hotels need booking before prices are hiked up the next morning; once that\u2019s decided, fans can start plotting out which other events might complement this final destination.\n\nThere\u2019s the summer party in Berlin; the Eurovision cruise that sets sail every September. January to March is national selection season \u2013 fans pick which events they\u2019ll be attending to watch the qualifiers progress. April and May are for preview parties: Amsterdam\u2019s Eurovision In Concert is the biggest, plus Moscow and Madrid, Tel Aviv and London are ones not to miss.\n\n\u201cFor half the year, fans are crisscrossing through Europe,\u201d says Simon Bennett from his home in London. \u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, it can consume your whole calendar.\u201d It\u2019s probably a little late for the 56-year-old to be worrying about that now. A tour guide by trade, for the past five years, he has been the president of the Eurovision fan club, OGAE International. \u201cWe\u2019re the umbrella organisation for the 45 national Eurovision fan clubs around the world, made up of more than 13,000 members,\u201d he explains.\n\nFor the people Bennett represents, news that Eurovision had been called off was devastating. There\u2019s the financial hit: ticket packages through OGAE cost a hefty \u20ac799 (\u00a3698); whether refunds will be forthcoming for flights, hotels and local events remains to be seen. And then there\u2019s the personal cost. \u201cThe biggest shame is that it\u2019s the one time a year that we see our family from across Europe and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe decision to cancel the show wasn\u2019t taken lightly. The competition is organised by the European Broadcasting Union, and it\u2019s their biggest event of the year. For Jon Ola Sand, this was to be his 10th and final year at the helm. The production team spent a month, says Sand, monitoring the international situation carefully. At first they considered hosting a slimmed-down event. Could it work with no audience? How about remotely?\n\n\u201cIn the end with the advice from the health authorities in the Netherlands,\u201d he says, \u201cand travel restrictions in several participating countries, we realised it would be impossible to go ahead.\u201d\n\nWhile many cultural institutions are adapting to these unexpected circumstances with innovative, online alternatives, Sand and his team saw no feasible way the show could continue fairly. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t want was an uneven playing field with a different type of competition,\u201d he tells me from his base in Norway. \u201cSongs and acts were specially created for that stage \u2013 so we decided it would be unfair to change any variables so late on.\u201d\n\nDelaying the event until later in the year was also a non-starter. Eurovision is more than the final television show: there\u2019s a full week of rehearsals, heats and run-throughs, plus a nonstop schedule of other events. For seven days, a host city is overrun with Eurovision fever: infrastructure, outdoor screens, hotels and transport all need to be arranged. Instead, on what was meant to be the finale night, there\u2019ll be an alternative live broadcast. Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light will see videos of this year\u2019s songs played out non-competitively, with a few sing-alongs and iconic faces from the past appearing, too. The BBC, meanwhile, has also put together its own replacement, Eurovision: Come Together. \u201cIn the end we had no other option but to pull it,\u201d says Sand. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m finding it\u2019s harder to close down a contest than to put one on.\u201d\n\nIt may take a year of hard graft for organisers to produce a Eurovision show and all that goes with it, but for Samanta T\u012bna the road to Rotterdam 2020 took a little longer to travel. Eight years, in fact. It wasn\u2019t a financial pull \u2013 not even the winning act gets any prize money \u2013 but a career-long ambition she craved to see through.\n\nThe 31-year-old singer\u2019s first attempt to represent Latvia was back in 2012. She came second in the televised qualifier and the following year was also runner-up. After a further two failed submissions, she gave it a final shot last year and placed seventh. At home in Riga, with only her dog for company, Tina says she had decided not to bother trying for 2020 when applications opened. But then she changed her mind.\n\nDespite the fact there are judges, the show isn\u2019t at all judgmental\n\n\u201cWhen I started performing my new song \u2013 Still Breathing \u2013 on stage,\u201d Tina says, \u201cI realised I had to enter. There\u2019d been other years when I\u2019d attempted to make it, but had known deep down I didn\u2019t have a track that would make me proud to represent my country. But with this song, I did.\u201d This time, she made it through. The ticket was hers. \u201cI just wish I could have clung on to that feeling a little longer,\u201d she says. \u201cFinally, the candy is in your hands but\u2026 when you\u2019re allowed to unwrap it, there\u2019s nothing there. I know that candy is mine.\u201d\n\nCheryl Baker remembers that sweet taste perfectly. It was 1981, and she and her fellow Bucks Fizz band members were in Dublin as the votes from across Europe slowly rolled in. Performing Making Your Mind Up on the Eurovision stage might have been nerve-racking (\u201cBloody terrifying,\u201d she says), but it earned the group a steady stream of points from every country: the catchy lyrics and kitsch outfits had gone down a treat.\n\n\u201cIt came down to the final vote,\u201d Baker recalls, nearly four decades later, \u201cand all the cameras were pointing at the German girl who looked happy. I just assumed that she had pipped us to the post. Then I realised: \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019ve won.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the airport arrivals lounge back in England the following evening, their song was pumped out through the PA \u2013 their lives had changed forever. Their single hit number one across Europe and they played Christmas Top of the Pops.\n\n\u201cFor me, winning Eurovision wasn\u2019t just fulfilling a childhood dream,\u201d Baker says. \u201cWithout it I wouldn\u2019t have my house, I\u2019d never have met my husband or had our kids. We still tour. Everything I have is because of Making Your Mind Up, a silly song with no meaning. Actually, I\u2019m pretty sure we can credit the four points we won by to the Velcro skirts we wore.\u201d\n\nMy virtual journey through Eurovision fandom takes me to every corner of Europe. There\u2019s Vladyslav with a Eurovision photo-collage pinned to his sitting-room wall in the Ukrainian town of Vinnytsia; Paulo in Barcelona, Paul in Manchester and California native Liz Guterbock, too. I make every effort to be indiscriminate, speaking to teenagers and pensioners, men and women, fans old and new. And yet, nearly every punter has one thing in common: they\u2019re almost all lesbian, bisexual or gay.\n\nProfessor Brian Singleton of Trinity College Dublin has considered why this might be the case more than most others: Eurovision \u2013 and the communities which adore it \u2013 has made up a fair chunk of his university research. His academic papers include: From Dana to Dustin: The Reputation of Old/New Ireland and the Eurovision Song Contest, and Part of the Show: The Global Networking of Irish Eurovision Song Contest Fans. A fan himself, Singleton was hesitant at first to study Eurovision too closely, worried that it might turn the thing he loved into something that felt more like work. But, he\u2019s relieved to say, that didn\u2019t happen, instead his academic research has deepened his appreciation and enjoyment.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Singleton says, \u201cthere\u2019s the campness and the glamour\u201d that helps attract a gay audience. But he believes there\u2019s something in both the music and the spectacle that is a little more profound. The narrative of many songs in the contest is of overcoming adversity, he suggests, and with a production on Eurovision\u2019s scale things do inevitably go wrong from time to time. Regardless, the show goes on.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Flag waving: fans from France arrive at the 2016 show in Stockholm. Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere are just so many moments of triumph in Eurovision,\u201d he continues, \u201cand that speaks to many LGBTQ+ people, certainly of my generation, who came of age in societies where homosexuality was criminalised.\u201d Singleton grew up just outside Omagh, Northern Ireland, during the Troubles when homosexuality was still illegal \u2013 tuning in through his teenage years offered a window into another, more hopeful and accepting world.\n\nToday, LGBTQ+ people in many competitor nations \u2013 Russia, Ukraine and Armenia, among others \u2013 continue to face discrimination or state-sanctioned persecution. At Eurovision 2009 in Moscow, local LGBTQ+ people organised a gay pride parade. \u201cThe police were chasing the few thousand people who turned up,\u201d Singleton recalls, \u201cwhile in the arena the state broadcaster was beaming out gay fans dancing to the world\u2019s LGBT community.\u201d Eurovision\u2019s message of possibility still brings hope to people in places where it\u2019s hard to be out and proud.\n\nMost fans I speak to have been hooked on Eurovision since early childhood, long before many of them had come to explore their sexuality and all it means. After a week of embracing all things Eurovision, I\u2019ve come to understand why people who are a little different are attracted to the competition\u2019s bright lights. As Rylan Clark-Neal \u2013 superfan turned BBC Eurovision presenter \u2013 puts it, inclusivity is woven into the contest\u2019s fabric. However much we Brits might take the piss, the show has a huge heart.\n\n\u201cI remember watching it through the years as a kid and being in awe of how, despite the fact there are literally judges, the show isn\u2019t at all judgmental,\u201d Clark-Neal says. \u201cYou can be transgender and win like Dana International; a group that\u2019s camp as Christmas like Scooch can take off.\u201d All languages, dances and styles of music are celebrated and welcomed, no questions asked. \u201cIt feels like a bubble \u2013 whether you\u2019re there in person, or watching on your sofa. And once you\u2019re inside, everything is safe and anything goes.\u201d", "author": ["Michael Segalov"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/hebridean-island-divided-tamsin-calidas-memoir", "published": "2020-05-10T06:23:17", "title": "Hebridean island divided after memoir explores darker fringe of Highland life", "text": "Neighbours of Tamsin Calidas, who moved to Scotland from London, are keen to put their side as her book I am an Island looks set for success\n\nTamsin Calidas\u2019s memoir about swapping Notting Hill for a croft on a small Hebridean island luxuriates in its landscape. The heather and the Munros, the raw skies and the wild tides of the Atlantic are lavishly described. The islanders, by contrast, are largely anonymous, thoughtless and cruel.\n\nThe author of I am an Island insists she was careful not to identify the island, which has fewer than 200 inhabitants, and Calidas is not the name by which she is known by her neighbours, but the islanders and many others worked out her identity well before the book was published last week.\n\nOne islander, Neil Carmichael, said: \u201cI got sent a link to a review of it and read some of it \u2013 then I showed my dad.\u201d The crofters both recognised the author immediately. \u201cIt has gone down badly with a lot of people.\u201d\n\nThe book is both a crofter\u2019s memoir and a psychological exploration of isolation, and seems likely to be a hit: extracts have been published in a national newspaper and Calidas was interviewed on Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour.\n\nThe blurb emphasises the high-flying London careers that she and husband Rab gave up to take on farming sheep and cattle. For centuries the history of crofting has been stained with tears and Calidas\u2019s memoir is no exception: IVF treatment fails, her marriage breaks down, and she fractures both hands. In the aftermath of divorce, she has no money and few friends, but rebuilds her life thanks to \u201cthe incredible ability of the natural world to provide when everything else has fallen away\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A coastal croft: the book glories in the Highlands\u2019 wild Atlantic landscapes. Photograph: Alamy\n\nA constant theme is that the magnificent Hebridean landscape has a darker fringe. Calidas describes continuing intimidation and abuse at the hands of some islanders. They object to her presence on the croft as an outsider, as English, as of mixed heritage and, later, as a single woman daring to work the land like a man.\n\nIn one bleak episode, Calidas tells of her pride in her tup, a breeding ram that wins a prize at the island\u2019s agricultural fair, but dies some weeks later. Then, she reveals, a chance word makes her think the sheep might have been poisoned. On Halloween night, she exhumes the body and takes it to Glasgow for examination by a veterinary pathologist: the results are inconclusive.\n\nThat incident was familiar to several islanders. Both Neil Carmichael and his father John said that baseless accusations had been made. (Calidas denies any accusations came from her.) Several islanders have anecdotes about other flashpoints. It\u2019s clear that ill-feeling for Calidas lingers.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just a load of rubbish,\u201d John Carmichael said of the book. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s done anything to her, as far as I know \u2026 She always did really have a chip on her shoulder.\u201d\n\nA lot of people from down south have money to buy property here \u2026 but anyone who does come has always been very welcome Neil Carmichael, crofter\n\nA woman whose family ties on the island stretch back for generations said: \u201cOf course it\u2019s desperately sad. But to repay people\u2019s kindness in this way is odd even for her. We\u2019re finding it quite amusing.\u201d\n\nThe scorn is not uniform. Another islander, an incomer like Calidas, spoke of the picture of \u201cwonderful welcoming communities\u201d painted by travel guides to the western highlands. \u201cPeople are incredibly kind-hearted, incredibly generous and will go a long, long way out of their way to help,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when it comes to land and tradition and family, there\u2019s another side.\u201d In the book, Calidas hints at islanders believing the croft ought to be theirs.\n\nBut the established families don\u2019t see it that way. \u201cAnyone can pick up the phone and get help from anyone,\u201d Neil Carmichael said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of new people.\u201d Since Calidas arrived in 2004, the island has become less focused on farming and more on tourism, with people from Mexico, Germany and the Netherlands now living there. \u201cA lot of people have come from down south and have the money to buy properties up here. That\u2019s just the way it is \u2013 people want to retire. But anyone that comes has always been very welcome.\u201d\n\nHis father was surprised to be told he wasn\u2019t named in the book. \u201cThat\u2019s quite disappointing that we didn\u2019t get a name,\u201d John Carmichael said. \u201cTerrible.\u201d\n\nCalidas said she had expected islanders to read her book, but that anyone trying to find themselves in her pages would not succeed as each incident was an amalgamation of events and all characters were blended.\n\n\u201cThere may well be people who want to pinpoint and blame and start from a position of fear,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t that book; this book is about love. It\u2019s a book about being an outsider coming into the community.\u201d\n\nShe added she had had \u201chuge amounts of love and support\u201d from other islanders and from her ex-husband. \u201cThe intention was to go beyond place. It\u2019s not bound by specificity of place. It\u2019s not a travelogue\u2026 I\u2019ve done everything possible to respect my friends, community and those around me.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not written in a very masculine, observational style.

Consulting her briefing book, she reeled off a list of outlets and articles she said had downplayed the threat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you with those questions,\u201d she said, \u201cand maybe you\u2019ll have some answers in a few days.\u201d\n\nAnd with a triumphant smirk she stepped away from the lectern, ignoring shouted questions. Reporters \u2013 physically distancing several seats apart \u2013 wore surprised and stony faces, then relaxed into wry smiles. It was a classic piece of \u201cwhataboutism\u201d as practised by pundits on cable news.\n\nThe TV president now has a TV emissary, a spokesperson who sometimes takes her eyes off the reporters in the room and looks directly into the camera \u2013 a study in contrast from the nervously darting eyes of Trump\u2019s first press secretary, Sean Spicer. McEnany is from what the president likes to call \u201ccentral casting\u201d: a polished performer, devout Christian and devout Trumpian. And she is only 32.\n\nRead or listen to her words prior to her decision to jump on the Trump train. She is a completely different person Anonymous TV pundit\n\n\u201cKayleigh McEnany: beautiful, Christian, conservative \u2026 designed by nature to enrage MSNBC viewers,\u201d tweeted Ann Coulter, a rightwing author and commentator, referring to the liberal-leaning network whose hosts often eviscerate the president.\n\nBut to critics, McEnany is a Trump apologist trying to explain the inexplicable and excuse the inexcusable. They characterise her as an opportunist motivated by fame and power rather than any ideological faith. They say she has abandoned her religious principles to normalise a president widely condemned as a misogynist and racist. They warn that she will be more effective at lying for Trump than her predecessors.\n\n\u2018To get on television\u2019\n\nThe eldest child of a roofing contractor, McEnany is from Plant City, Florida, which she describes as \u201cthe world\u2019s strawberry capital\u201d. She attended the Academy of the Holy Names Catholic high school in Tampa and found time to volunteer for the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2004. She moved to Washington to study at Georgetown, took an exchange year at Oxford to study politics and served an internship in the Bush White House.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest McEnany attends a meeting between Donald Trump and Texas governor Greg Abbott in the Oval Office. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAfter graduating in 2010, she worked for three years as a production assistant at Fox News for Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and father of Sarah Sanders, Trump\u2019s second press secretary. In 2012, she wrote a tweet about Barack Obama, the country\u2019s first black president, that has come back to haunt her: \u201cHow I Met Your Brother \u2013 Never mind, forgot he\u2019s still in that hut in Kenya. #ObamaTVShows.\u201d\n\nBiden's lead over Trump widens \u2013 but strain on his virtual campaign grows Read more\n\nMcEnany wanted a job in front of the camera but couldn\u2019t get a break. Eventually she decided to become a student again, first at the University of Miami School of Law, then transferring to Harvard. Huckabee told the New York Times last month: \u201cI think one of the reasons that Kayleigh went on to law school was because she didn\u2019t see she was going to have an on-air opportunity at Fox any time soon.\u201d\n\nBut in 2015, McEnany received some intriguing career advice over cocktails from Michael Marcantonio, a fellow summer associate at a law firm and a Democrat. In an interview with the New York Times, he recalled telling her \u201cDonald Trump is going to be your nominee,\u201d adding that if \u201ca smart, young, blond Harvard graduate\u201d wanted \u201cto get on television and have a career as a political pundit, you would be wise to be an early backer\u201d.\n\nMcEnany did so. Networks were struggling to find eloquent champions of the Trump cause but she fitted the bill. She became a paid contributor on CNN, feeding the outrage machine and the concept of cable news as combat sport.\n\nA political commentator acquainted with McEnany, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cThey brought her on board when it became pretty clear that there were few people who were willing to defend Donald Trump that were somewhat sane. Most people who were credible and experienced were not willing to put their names or reputations on the line to defend Donald Trump\u2019s crazy during 2016.\n\nIf Kayleigh can go toe to toe with the toughest anchors and commentators, she\u2019ll do just fine with the White House press Jason Miller\n\n\u201cIt became abundantly clear that the people who were willing to do it were either seeking relevance, like Jeffrey Lord, or they recognised that, \u2018This is my meal ticket to getting media attention and my way to break into cable punditry.\u2019 Kayleigh McEnany was one of those people. It was clear that her ambition to be in front of the camera was all that motivated her and it worked for her.\u201d\n\nIn June 2015, McEnany had described Trump\u2019s comments about Mexican migrants as \u201cracist\u201d and dismissed him as a \u201cshowman\u201d. She quickly changed her tune. The source said: \u201cShe is unrecognisable. If you were to read or listen to her words prior to her decision to sell her soul and jump on the Trump train, she is a completely different person.\u201d\n\n\u2018Kayleigh never backed down\u2019\n\nTo Trump supporters, McEnany\u2019s ability to rile liberals made her something of a heroine. Even at the nadir of the Trump candidacy, when an Access Hollywood tape revealed him boasting about grabbing women\u2019s genitalia, she had his back, saying: \u201cThose comments are despicable [but] he apologised for them.\u201d\n\nSean Hannity, a Fox News host, wrote in a forward to McEnany\u2019s book, The New American Revolution: The Making of a Populist Movement: \u201cOutnumbered 8-to-1, or if she was lucky, 7-to-2, Kayleigh never backed down in fighting for the conservative movement supporting Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nJason Miller, who also appeared as a pro-Trump pundit on CNN and is now co-host of the podcast War Room: Pandemic, said: \u201cKeep in mind that she went through a couple of years of being a CNN political commentator where she was rumbling with Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo and Van Jones and Ana Navarro and every other hater that\u2019s out there.\n\n\u201cSo if Kayleigh can go toe to toe with the toughest anchors and commentators on TV, she\u2019ll do just fine with the White House press corps. I know that President Trump greatly respects Kayleigh\u2019s abilities on TV battling tough questions.\u201d\n\nOnce Trump had stunned the world by winning the White House in 2016, McEnany joined the Republican National Committee as spokeswoman, then moved to the Trump campaign in a similar role. She would sometimes work 18 or 20 hours a day, according to Tim Murtaugh, director of communications for the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cKayleigh was fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was a joy to work with. Her work ethic is second to none. She\u2019s smart, she\u2019s energetic, she\u2019s engaged and she\u2019s the most prepared person that I know. She really puts a lot of thought and effort into her work and she has a keen grasp of policy and is able to turn what are sometimes complicated policy matters into language that is easily digested by the listener.\u201d\n\nMurtaugh accused opponents of discriminating against McEnany because of her looks and gender.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest McEnany holds her daughter Blake while posing with her parents, Mike and Leanne, and younger sister, Ryann, at the podium in the Brady Press Briefing Room. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe first thing the liberals want to do when they see an attractive young woman in a position like this is they want to question her intelligence. And I would just say to people, you underestimate Kayleigh McEnany at your own peril. I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re turning out too many dummies from Oxford and Harvard Law School.\u201d\n\n\u2018God\u2019s spirit was ever-present\u2019\n\nMurtaugh also recalled how McEnany organised a Bible study group with other staff that met weekly in a conference room at campaign HQ in Arlington, Virginia. Since the pandemic lockdown, the group has continued to meet virtually.\n\nLike many evangelicals, McEnany apparently sees no contradiction between Trump\u2019s behaviour and Christian values. Two years ago, when she had a preventative double mastectomy because of a BRCA2 genetic mutation that had put her at high risk of breast cancer, she wrote: \u201cMy faith in Jesus Christ was my strength that day.\u201d\n\nI will never lie to you. You have my word on that. Kayleigh McEnany\n\nShe is an ardent admirer of Ravi Zacharias, a preacher whose organisation included a study centre in Oxford. She wrote in 2013: \u201cOxford needed a Christian to respond to Richard Dawkins. Found that in Ravi, who has dismantled atheism.\u201d This week her sister, Ryann, who also works for the Trump campaign, tweeted: \u201cWatching my sister take the stage for her first White House press briefing last Friday was a surreal moment! God\u2019s spirit was ever-present in that room and undeniably flowing through you.\u201d\n\nIn 2017 McEnany married Sean Gilmartin, a pitcher for the Tampa Bay Rays. She posed with Blake, the couple\u2019s five-month-old daughter, at the White House lectern after her debut briefing, the first by a press secretary in more than 13 months, where she declared: \u201cI will never lie to you. You have my word on that.\u201d\n\nShe now has three briefings under her belt. She has echoed Trump\u2019s false and misleading statements but avoided major controversy \u2013 and, importantly, avoided stealing too much of his limelight.\n\nKurt Bardella, a political analyst and Trump critic who bested McEnany in a debate on gun control on MSNBC, said: \u201cKayleigh is very on point, succinct, direct and speaks with a lot of confidence and comfort from the podium.\n\n\u201cWatching her first briefing. I thought, \u2018Wow, she\u2019s very similar to Kellyanne Conway, has a natural comfort that comes from the repetitive exercise of dealing with reporters day in and day out and being on TV so often that that she will be the most effective press secretary this president has had.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn leaked conversation Obama says US 'rule of law' at risk after Flynn case dropped Read more\n\nLike Conway, Bardella believes, McEnany saw a chance for career advancement and seized it.\n\n\u201cOutside of the president, the White House press secretary traditionally is the most visible person in the administration. This is something that she will be able to live off of for the rest of her life.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s diehard ideological alignment more than just an opportunity. Donald Trump is a person with no ideology or core conviction. This is someone whose core ideology is nothing more than whatever is transactional and advantageous to him at that moment in time.\u201d", "author": ["David Smith"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/ahmaud-arbery-father-marcus-georgia-running", "published": "2020-05-10T06:00:17", "title": "'They lynched him': Ahmaud Arbery's father on the killing of his son", "text": "Marcus Arbery Sr says Ahmaud\u2019s death at the hands of two white men, while he was out for a run, was an act of racism\n\n'They lynched him': Ahmaud Arbery's father on the killing of his son\n\nMarcus Arbery Sr says his son was just like him, fit and athletic.\n\n\u2018Every stone will be uncovered\u2019: how Georgia officials failed the Ahmaud Arbery case Read more\n\nNearly everyone who talks about his youngest son, Ahmaud Arbery, remembers him running. Neighbors saw him jogging nearly every day. Ahmaud\u2019s route would take him along the flat, curved road outside the home he shared with his mother, then into the unincorporated community of Satilla Shores on the Georgia coast just outside of Brunswick. Ahmaud would wave to the regulars on his route.\n\n\u201cHe just loved to work out and he just loved people,\u201d his father told the Guardian.\n\nWhen the 25-year-old left for a run on a sunny February afternoon, he passed, for the last time, neighbors whose Ring alerts would go off as he raced by their homes. He would eventually meet Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son, Travis, 34. Shortly afterwards, Ahmaud was shot at least twice.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot and killed in Brunswick, Georgia. Photograph: Reuters\n\nHe was dead before officers arrived.\n\nFor more than two months, Marcus Sr \u2013 along with his son\u2019s siblings and mother \u2013 demanded answers. But as the case went through three district attorneys after the first two had to recuse themselves due to ties with Gregory McMichael, no one was charged in his son\u2019s death.\n\nAhmaud\u2019s family was devastated.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have two different justice systems in America: one for black America and one for white America,\u201d Ben Crump, the lawyer representing Marcus Sr, told the Guardian.\n\nThat day in February, the McMichaels told police that Ahmaud matched the description of someone caught on a security camera committing a burglary in the neighborhood. This week, a leaked video appeared to contradict the elder McMichael\u2019s statement to police insisting Ahmaud violently attacked his son.\n\nGregory McMichael\u2019s story also contradicts Marcus Sr\u2019s memories of his son. \u201cHe was just a lovable young man and he would give you the shirt off of his back,\u201d he said of the youngest of his three children, who would have turned 26 on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about doing a celebration for him during the weekend,\u201d Marcus Sr says. Thousands of people in Glynn county and across America also celebrated Ahmaud on Friday by doing something he loved: running. Near his mother\u2019s house, people took the same route Ahmaud would run, walking or jogging 2.23 miles, representing the last day of Arbery\u2019s young life.\n\nHe was just a lovable young man and he would give you the shirt off of his back Marcus Arbery Sr\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep running for you, bro, until justice is served,\u201d one of his friends posted on Facebook while jogging.\n\nWithin two days of the release of the video of his death, after 10 weeks of local law enforcement failing to investigate, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation made arrests and promised to continue the investigation. The McMichaels were charged with murder and aggravated assault on Thursday, the day before Ahmaud would have turned 26.\n\nHis father calls the shooting an act of racism by the McMichaels, who are white. The Arbery family is black. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with racism my whole life here,\u201d Marcus Sr says of the community. \u201cEverybody\u2019s supposed to be equal.\u201d\n\nThough he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s the way justice works in Glynn county, he hopes the shooting of his youngest child may be the catastrophic event that changes how this corner of Georgia operates.\n\nEven if that change does come, he says, it will be in exchange for his son\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cI got to live without my son and they lynched him.

As Silverstone considers hosting two consecutive races behind closed doors in July, the volunteer marshals are having to consider the new realities imposed on Formula One by the coronavirus crisis.\n\nDoyle, 28, has been marshalling for five years, during which she has worked at two British Grands Prix. It is clearly a labour of love and one she shares with her fiance, Keith Bond, himself a marshal for 15 years, including seven GPs at the circuit. They are members of the marshals team there and had been selected to work at this year\u2019s race.\n\nF1 on track for July resumption after drivers' association backs safety plan Read more\n\nThe presence of marshals is vital for safety reasons and as F1 attempts to go racing again and potentially hold a double-header at Silverstone, they are as crucial as the drivers and cars. Doyle and Bond usually marshal at circuits across the UK most weekends but they recognise that much as the sport is desperate to get back on track it should only do so if it will not pose any additional risk to the health of the wider community.\n\n\u201cWe did a couple of rallies before lockdown but then decided we wouldn\u2019t attend race meetings \u2013 we just thought it wasn\u2019t the responsible thing to do,\u201d says Doyle. \u201cPeople we spoke to had similar feelings. As much as we want to get back to it we recognise what is the responsible decision, even if it is not the desired decision.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carolyn Doyle and her fiance Keith Bond are marshals at Silverstone but only want to see motor racing return if it has no impact on the health system.\n\nIf F1 makes the decision to go ahead at Silverstone, the numbers involved are no small beer. Last year there were 980 people ensuring the safe functioning of the track. These included rescue units, recovery crews and medical coverage, with a doctor on every one of the 34 marshalling posts. That total does include customer service volunteers and spectator marshals, neither of whom would be required for a race without fans, but for track marshals alone the figures are between 350and 400.\n\nFor these hundreds of volunteers the outbreak has posed new questions. \u201cOn post it is possible to socially distance and marshal,\u201d Bond says. \u201cIt would be easy to stand two metres apart. But we couldn\u2019t socially distance if we were dealing with an incident and we needed to be close together. If that was needed we would just get on with it, that is what we are there for.\u201d\n\nF1\u2019s intent is to test all team, broadcasting and logistical personnel for the virus before race meetings. Their concept of a safe, \u201cclosed biosphere\u201d will depend on ensuring all the marshals are included but Motorsport UK, which oversees marshalling of the event, has yet to confirm if it will carry out testing. This could be key for many marshals agreeing to take part. \u201cIf people are tested and not showing any symptoms that means we can operate in a greatly safer environment,\u201d says Bond.\n\nDoyle, however, expressed concern that the sport must also take into account the bigger picture. \u201cI would feel very uncomfortable if there was an incident and a driver was taken to a hospital,\u201d she says. \u201cEven a driver with a minor injury that requires medical attention is an unnecessary burden on the health system at the moment. We all want to get back to racing, we all miss it, but it seems a slightly unnecessary risk. A lot of fellow marshals work in the NHS and it doesn\u2019t seem fair to put any more on them.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nNadine Lewis is the national chair of the British Motorsports Marshals Club, whose members also work at the British Grand Prix. She says Motorsport UK is in discussions to address these issues with F1, Silverstone and the government. It must also consider simple logistics far from the paddock that mean a great deal to the volunteers, such as how they physically distance on the campsites where they stay or where they would obtain food with no commercial retailers on site.\n\nIf the questions can be answered, the marshalling family is eager to get back to it and as always the sport will owe them a great debt.

It was a statement signing, a deal designed not only to land the player, but to emphasise PSG\u2019s financial power, to highlight their status as a super-club while inflating the market to a level at which only the mega-rich could compete.\n\nThree years on, with football suspended across the globe and major leagues desperately seeking ways to get games on to stave off financial apocalypse, the world looks very different. A model predicated on constant growth has received an abrupt shock.\n\nPlayer wages and contracts will bankrupt EFL clubs: it's time for the PFA to act | Mark Palios Read more\n\nWhatever the new reality when football does eventually return, whether a sense of social responsibility has set in or, as seems more likely given the direction of travel over the past three decades, the game becomes more focused on the elite and moves ever closer to a franchise-based structure, there will be an adjustment.\n\nEven those clubs backed by sovereign wealth funds will find themselves hampered by financial fair play restrictions that inevitably track the wider economy. The indications are that FFP will be relaxed for a year or two so as not to penalise clubs who have suddenly, and through no fault of their own, found their revenue streams blocked, but there appears little desire to return to a free-for-all of spending.\n\nBefore Neymar, the transfer record had more than doubled only twice. In 1903, Small Heath (now Birmingham ) splurged \u00a3500 on the Barnsley inside-forward Benny Green, quintupling a decade-old record that had stood since Aston Villa had broken the three-figure barrier to acquire the Scottish forward Willie Groves from West Bromwich. In 1932, River Plate signed the barrel-chested centre-forward Bernab\u00e9 Ferreyra from Tigre for \u00a323,000, obliterating the mark set four years earlier when Arsenal had bought the inside-forward David Jack from Bolton for \u00a310,890 and taking the record outside of Britain for the first time. Green\u2019s record stood for barely nine months but Ferreyra was the most expensive player in the world for 17 years. Neymar\u2019s record could conceivably stand as long.\n\nBernab\u00e9 Ferreyra is mobbed by River Plate fans during his last match in 1939.\n\nFerreyra is an outlier for a number of reasons. The Argentinian game was going through a period of rapid growth, fuelled by radio broadcasts that carried commentary from Buenos Aires to the jungles of Tucum\u00e1n in the north to the dusty foothills of the Andes in the west to the wind-blasted chill of Tierra del Fuego in the south, pulling the young nation together.\n\nArgentina had reached the final of the Olympics in 1928 and the World Cup in 1930, both times suffering defeats to their neighbours Uruguay that only intensified the yearning for success. The country\u2019s league had turned professional in 1931, generating a new wave of interest and leading to a boom in membership at the biggest clubs.\n\nWorld Cup stunning moments: the Conte Verde's trip to Uruguay in 1930 Read more\n\nAlthough the coup against Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen in 1930 had begun Argentina\u2019s d\u00e9cada infame, the years of corruption, repression and economic decline that led ultimately to Juan Per\u00f3n\u2019s seizure of power in 1943, when Ferreyra was signed the full impact of the Great Depression was yet to be felt. He was an enormous success, famed for a ferocious shot that brought him an average of a goal a game for eight seasons. Ferreyra\u2019s popularity effectively funded the construction of El Monumental, but as the global downturn struck, particularly in the industrial areas where football had previously thrived, no other club came close to matching the fee.\n\nIt was only with the surge in attendances in the UK after the second world war and then investment in Italian clubs by local industrialists that the record was challenged again. The inside-forward Johnny Morris, having fallen out with Matt Busby, was sold by Manchester United to Derby for \u00a324,000 in 1949 and the record fell a further four times in the following three years.\n\nThe Ferreyra and Neymar situations are analogous in as much as River and PSG made their signings aware the deal would project an image of wealth and power. In both cases, the player was sufficiently celebrated to justify the expenditure even as the cliff edge suddenly appeared. But what now for clubs, what now for transfers, during the crisis? \u201cIt feels somewhat inappropriate to see speculation about transfers for hundreds of millions in current circumstances,\u201d Manchester United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, said this past week. \u201cThere\u2019s a big disconnect between those stories and the economic realities facing football clubs in general.\u201d\n\nRevenues will fall. There will be a period of, probably, several months when games are played without full stadiums. United\u2019s match-day revenue last season was \u00a3110m; that cannot easily be replaced. A major recession seems all but certain. Sponsorship, advertising and commercial income will all drop. There will be a fall in subscriptions to television channels which, along with reduced advertising, will diminish broadcast deals. Nobody knows how travel may continue to be affected, reducing the viability of international tournaments and foreign tours. This is the biggest financial hit facing the game since the 30s.\n\nPremier League critics should recognise football cannot wait for ever | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nBut the word Woodward used seemed apposite \u2013 \u201cinappropriate\u201d. Clubs have been furloughing staff. They\u2019ve been asking players to defer wages or take pay cuts. If there is a severe recession, how could any club justify spending \u00a3200m on a player in a time of mass unemployment and poverty, particularly if they\u2019ve asked government or players to tide them over?\n\nThe optics of the big deal will change. Not that the likely alternative \u2013 major clubs with the resources to ride out difficult times preying on the desperation of weaker ones and grabbing their players for bargain prices \u2013 is any more palatable.\n\nEither way, the Neymar fee is likely to stand for years as Ferreyra\u2019s did, as a totem of a previous age when elite football believed in its own eternal capacity to generate money, the era of confidence, bordering on hubris, before the virus struck.", "author": ["Jonathan Wilson"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/10/swearing-when-west-ham-played-behind-closed-doors", "published": "2020-05-10T07:00:18", "title": "'There was a lot of swearing': the night West Ham played behind closed doors | Jacob Steinberg", "text": "Two players and a photographer remember what it was like to face Castilla at an empty Upton Park in 1980\n\nAt half-time West Ham\u2019s former chairman Len Cearns was sent on a futile mission by his fellow directors.

For Castilla, who had qualified after losing the Copa del Rey final against Real, the Spanish champions, playing at such a famous ground was meant to be the stuff of dreams. In the stands it was anything but. There were ugly scenes in the away end and there was tragedy after the game when a West Ham fan died after being hit by a bus in the chaos outside the ground.\n\nUefa responded by fining West Ham \u00a37,750 and ordering them to play their next two European home games at least 187 miles away from Upton Park. Sunderland\u2019s Roker Park was one possibility for the second leg, while Martin remembers talk of the second leg taking place in Middlesbrough. Cross says the players were told they may have to play in France.\n\nAfter an appeal by West Ham, Uefa decided to stage the game at Upton Park with no supporters present. There was also no live coverage on television and the official attendance was 262. \u201cWe would have relied on the fans at Upton Park, especially on a midweek game under the floodlights,\u201d Martin says.

The Paris Saint-Germain midfielder, who on Thursday signed a new contract which will take her up to her seventh Olympic Games next summer and keep her at the top of European football into her 44th year, plays with abandon and a desire to progress the game every time she laces up her boots.\n\nUnlike the one-word monikers of many Brazilian greats, Formiga is a nickname, not a shortened version of her name: Miraildes Maciel Mota. Triggered by her unselfish play and intensity, her teammates on the streets of Salvador called her the Portuguese word for ant, and it stuck.\n\nShe has played 77 games for PSG since joining in 2017 and won the Coupe de France, a freak storm helping the team deny Lyon the treble in 2018. Previously she spent almost all her career in the US and Brazilian leagues \u2013 a year in Sweden the outlier.\n\nOn the international stage she has left a mark in the record books. Formiga made her World Cup debut in 1995 as a 17-year-old, when Brazil beat Norway in the third-place play-off to earn bronze, and has become the only player to have appeared in seven World Cups \u2013 all but one of the Fifa-approved tournaments.

In that game against Jamaica Cristiane Rozeira became, at 34, the oldest player to score a Women\u2019s World Cup hat-trick. The talent is not coming through to force these legends to make way. Perhaps an inability to progress the domestic game in Brazil significantly and provide pathways to the top is part of the reason why the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o have failed to better finishing as World Cup runners-up in 2007.\n\nThe pioneers have rolled back the years time and again in an effort to force change. It prompted a passionate plea from Marta on their exit from last summer\u2019s tournament. \u201cThere is not going to be a Formiga forever, a Marta forever, a Cristiane,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen\u2019s football is relying on you to survive.

After all, it does not now appear that the coronavirus will just go away if you simply ignore it like an annoying wasp at a picnic, as was originally thought.

But not this year.\n\nCheese has fallen down a Gloucestershire cliff every Whit Monday or so since before the birth of Christ. And before cows were domesticated, fungus-fuelled Cotswold shamans would merely stare at a space where they knew that a falling cheese, whatever that was, would one day be. But this spring bank holiday, the crowds will not make their unregulated pilgrimage across the hills to the quasi-illegal ritual. I hope some local hero rolls the cheese anyway, late at night by moonlight, so that the world keeps turning. Some semblance of cosmic order must be maintained in the face of this invisible enemy which you couldn\u2019t really have seen coming even though everyone said it was and we really needed to get our shit together like fast man.\n\nPressure is on the PM to act decisively, or at least do something else significant, so no one notices that he didn\u2019t.

So much of our life depends on defying it", "text": "Cormorants are hunting fish in the now clear waters of Venice. Wild boars roam the avenues of Barcelona and wild goats the streets of Llandudno. Above Los Angeles are blue skies. From smogless Delhi, you can once more glimpse the Himalayas.\n\n\u201cThe Earth is healing, we are the virus,\u201d runs the meme spreading fast across the internet. It\u2019s a sentiment echoed by many policymakers, commentators and celebrities.\n\n\u201cNature is sending us a message,\u201d said the UN\u2019s Inger Andersen. \u201cFrom the point of view of Mother Nature,\u201d the journalist Fintan O\u2019Toole suggests, coronavirus \u201cmakes things better.\u201d Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, agrees. \u201cMother Nature has sent us to our rooms\u2026 like the spoilt children we are,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cShe tried to warn us but in the end she took back control.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Ferguson needs reminding that \u201ctaking back control\u201d has meant condemning hundreds of thousands of people to death, hundreds of thousands more to losing their livelihoods, and threatening, in the words of the UN World Food Programme\u2019s David Beasley, \u201cfamines of biblical proportions\u201d.\n\nWe should remind ourselves, too, that what is now seen as unnatural and sinful was, not so long ago, celebrated as natural and authentic. Ever since the pandemic broke out in Wuhan, Chinese wet markets have been denounced as despicable and vile. Yet when Alan Levinovitz lived in China, \u201cwandering through the open-air stalls felt liberating and authentic, a welcome change from sterile supermarkets where the chicken lies behind glass, plastic-wrapped by faceless corporations\u201d. Here was \u201cmeat in its natural state: unrefrigerated, unprocessed, unpackaged, uncooked and sometimes unslaughtered\u201d.\n\nLevinovitz, associate professor of religion at James Madison University, had already finished writing his new book, Natural, before the pandemic was unleashed. It is, nevertheless, an indispensable read, not least for all the \u201chumans are the virus\u201d memers.\n\nSocieties are structured in ways that ensure that innovation and development remain the privilege of the few\n\nConcepts of \u201cnature\u201d and of the \u201cnatural\u201d have, Levinovitz shows, become synonyms for \u201cGod\u201d and the \u201choly\u201d. Humans are sinners not because we have disobeyed God but because we have violated nature, our teacher, in whose wisdom we must discover the moral rules by which we ought to live.\n\nSuch a moral appeal to nature has long been the means of justifying particular human laws and structures. From interracial relationships to homosexuality, certain activities are deemed as transgressing natural boundaries and so to be forbidden. A ban on interracial marriage, as a Pennsylvania judge observed in 1865, was necessary to prevent the \u201ccorruption of races\u201d.\n\nMany supporters of interracial and same-sex marriage ironically also appeal to nature. Racial mixing, 19th-century campaigners argued, is found throughout history. Non-human species, contemporary LBGTQ activists insist, also exhibit same-sex attraction. \u201cNatural goodness,\u201d Levinovitz observes, is \u201ca mercenary ethic that anyone can hire to fight for their cause.\u201d It\u2019s one of the qualities of both God and nature that he or she is always on our side.\n\nIt\u2019s not just supposedly aberrant lifestyles that are condemned as unnatural. From IVF to genetically modified food, from vaccines to cloning, critics view many scientific and technological advances as the desecration of nature. How nature is becomes seen as a template for what humans ought to do. And yet so much of human life \u2013 from the aspirin we take to alleviate pain to the fridge that helps prevent milk from souring \u2013 is a recognition that natural processes often work to our disadvantage, and the moral stance would be to keep them at bay.\n\nThe romanticisation of the \u201cnatural\u201d is, Levinovitz notes, rooted in privilege. Only those who enjoy a lifestyle sufficiently protected from the ravages of nature have the licence to romanticise it. In countries with robust health systems, people have the dispensation to opt for natural childbirth, or alternative medicines, or reject vaccines. In much of the world in which \u201cnatural\u201d childbirth is an imposition on women, not a choice, both maternal and infant mortality rates are staggeringly high. It is poverty that condemns so many in the global south to rely on traditional medicine or to live without vaccines.\n\nAfter reading in the New Yorker about how much better was the \u201cnatural\u201d parenting style of the Matsigenka, a Peruvian Amazonian tribe, Levinovitz travelled to Peru to see for himself. He was disappointed that they lived not in a \u201cstate of nature\u201d but with solar panels and mobile phones. He asked a local whether he was \u201chappy about having electricity\u201d. \u201cHe looked at me with confusion,\u201d Levinovitz recalls: \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said flatly, as if explaining something to a child. \u2018Now we can see at night.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, those who are most desperate for the unnatural wonders that people in rich nations take for granted \u2013 electricity, clean water, transport, refrigeration, medicines \u2013 are also most at risk from the depredations brought about by industrial society. Last week, at least 11 people were killed and hundreds hospitalised after an explosion and gas leak in a chemicals factory in the Indian town of Visakhapatnam.\n\nIndia remains haunted by memories of the terrible Bhopal disaster of 1984, when an explosion in a pesticide factory led to the release of deadly methyl isocyanate gas. Half a million people were exposed to the toxin, and up to 16,000 may have died. Almost 40 years on, the site is still not detoxified.\n\nIt is the poor, whether in rich countries or in the global south, who most suffer from industrial pollution, are most imperilled by climate change and most threatened by the consequences of the coronavirus. This is not because humans are violating nature, but because societies are structured in ways that ensure that innovation and development remain the privilege of the few, while depredation and ill health are the lot of the many.\n\nChallenging both the lack of development and environmental devastation requires not fatuous claims that \u201chumans are the virus\u201d but confronting policies that limit innovation, impose inequality and put profits before people. It is the \u201cbad\u201d of the social, not the \u201cgood\u201d of the natural, that we need to address.\n\n\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist", "author": ["Kenan Malik"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/working-with-women-makes-the-world-a-better-place", "published": "2020-05-10T05:30:16", "title": "Working with women makes the world a better place | Torsten Bell", "text": "Discrimination over jobs is bad.

That is the important finding from new research on the (not famously diverse) world of judges. The study looks at the hiring of law clerks by senior judges in the US.\n\nJudges have almost total discretion on hiring aspiring lawyers for these prestigious posts, which makes it easy to investigate what might lead to different decisions.\n\nIt turns out that male judges who have worked alongside female judges are significantly more likely to hire a female law clerk \u2013 by four percentage points in the following year. Female judges who have worked alongside female peers are 1.6 percentage points more likely to hire a female law clerk. The authors say that male judges gain a more positive view of women\u2019s \u201cprofessional capabilities\u201d from working alongside them \u2013 a realisation that is understandably a lot less ground-breaking for those same senior female judges\u2026 So for all those company leaders out there puzzling over how to diversify the people you hire, the answer is diversify yourselves.\n\n\u2022 Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nOf all the pubs in London, few can boast a history quite as glamorous or telling as the French House in Soho. During the war the pub became the unofficial home of the French resistance. Charles de Gaulle, in exile, used to walk down there from his home in Hampstead to meet his lieutenants to plot over dinner. His great rallying cry to the Free French \u2013 \u201c\u00c0 tous les Fran\u00e7ais, la France a perdu une bataille! Mais la France n\u2019a pas perdu la guerre!\u201d \u2013 was said to have been written in the upstairs bar.\n\nThe inspirational powers of the pub persisted in peacetime: Brendan Behan wrote much of The Quare Fellow in a favourite corner; Dylan Thomas, after a long night, left his only manuscript of Under Milk Wood under a bar stool. Lesley Lewis, landlady for the past 30 years, has made sure the pub retains its heritage as a home of artists and free spirits, but in common with all other hostelries in the country the French House is facing an uncertain future. Last week, a crowdfunder was established to help the pub pay its eye-watering Soho rent.\n\nMy contribution to VE Day celebrations was to make a small donation: vive the French!\n\nOne rule to survive by\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski with soldiers in Angola, 1975.

He had many brushes with death \u2013 once, at a road block, he was doused with petrol, while the drunk guards argued among themselves whether to set him alight (How did that feel? \u201cVery cold indeed.\u201d) The thing that had scared him most, however, was not war itself, but the prospect of falling ill in a place without healthcare.\n\n\u201cThe question of life and death in our culture is very important,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are places that those questions are not so important.\u201d To keep himself well, he had one rule, which I subsequently adopted the few times I\u2019ve been reporting in any place where a hospital might be two days\u2019 drive away. \u201cDo not eat anything that has been cut with a knife. The edge of a knife carries all the bacteria.

It is understandable that a stylish phrase or a persuasive analogy from the mouth of an authority figure should be met with caution.\n\nMany are now also wary of the comparisons with the Second World War that are lobbed at the population each week by politicians, for the globe is not waging a military campaign or fighting a battle, there is no violent human enemy to defeat. Instead, we are all engaged in a unique and sustained mass experiment in protection and survival.\n\nYet on two occasions in the past few days this kneejerk aversion to establishment speechifying could safely be put aside. The sombre VE Day addresses delivered by both the Queen and by Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, proved that not every piece of powerful penmanship is a decoy. Their words were so moving because they were well written and because their intent shone through.\n\nIt may have been sheer rhetoric for Steinmeier to compare the isolation of the German people in 1945 with the loneliness of lockdown, and later for the Queen to suggest that the empty streets of Britain this VE Day were in fact full of love, but the emotive language deployed was clearly at the service of a valuable message. So, if tears did prick a little when both leaders emphasised that international fellow-feeling was as important today as it was 75 years ago, then it was proof that not all impressive expressions of sentiment are to be distrusted.\n\n\u2022 Vanessa Thorpe is the Observer\u2019s arts and media correspondent", "author": ["Vanessa Thorpe"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/how-did-we-end-up-turning-our-care-homes-into-jails-of-enforced-loneliness", "published": "2020-05-10T07:30:19", "title": "How did we end up turning our care homes into jails of enforced loneliness?", "text": "Last week, driving to the shops, I passed a care home and saw a figure standing at an upstairs window: an old woman looking out at a world she could not enter. She looked like a prisoner. And in a way, that\u2019s probably what she was.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about old people. Let\u2019s talk about people in care homes, about people living with dementia and dying with dementia, out of sight and out of mind, and what the lockdown means for them. Let\u2019s talk about what we are not talking about enough, not thinking about enough, not caring about enough.\n\nOf course we should be dismayed and angry at the lack of personal protective equipment in hospitals \u2013 but what about in care homes? We should clap for NHS workers and recognise their courageous, crucial work \u2013 but what about also celebrating carers, those men and women who are badly paid or not paid at all, who are barely recognised for doing the hard work of looking after the frail, the defenceless, the invisible crowd of humans we may prefer to forget?\n\nIt is estimated that approximately a sixth or more of all deaths from Covid-19 have occurred in care homes, although their residents only account for about 1% of the population. In England and Wales, in the week ending 17 April, nearly 25% of recorded deaths from the virus happened there. The peak of infection is said to have passed \u2013 but in care homes it is accelerating, and recorded Covid-19 care home deaths are now running at approximately 2,500 a week. One care home provider has said that death rates are now eight times the rate of admission. In Scotland, 40% of its 2,272 deaths from the virus up to 26 April took place in care homes. Many experts believe that the eventual death toll will be higher in these settings than in hospitals. In Spain, it is now thought that more than two-thirds of deaths from coronavirus have been in care homes. Outside one home in New York, trucks were parked to store bodies. It\u2019s carnage.\n\nAt first, the old and the vulnerable were airbrushed out of the UK picture: until the end of April, only deaths from the virus that occurred in hospital were counted, which was why on 29 April, the figures suddenly jumped by 4,000. And then, the old and vulnerable became almost like collateral damage: people were dying, dying in their hundreds and thousands \u2013 \u201cbut\u201d they were old. It\u2019s sad, of course, but not very sad, for the old aren\u2019t us. They\u2019re different, the others, the ones who don\u2019t matter so much because they\u2019re at the end of things, not the fresh beginning.\n\nTime changes the meaning of isolation for someone who is old and vulnerable and may not have much time left\n\nSince those who are old are at high risk, many care settings have become like fortresses or besieged cities \u2013 no one\u2019s allowed in, because they might carry the virus and release it to run amok among the most vulnerable. But if the virus is dangerous and often deadly, so too is isolation for people living with dementia.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, hospitals suspended visitors, but made three exceptions: patients were allowed to have one partner or visitor if they were receiving end-of-life care, were in labour, or were children. A few weeks later, after heartbreak and devastation, a fourth category of visitor was added to the NHS guidance: patients who had mental health conditions such as dementia, where the absence of a loved one would cause distress and damage \u2013 because isolation is dangerous for those who are frail and confused; it can be fatal.\n\nMany hospitals are still not following this clear and explicit advice: John\u2019s Campaign \u2013 \u201cfor the right to stay with people with dementia\u201d \u2013 looked at the websites of 52 mental health trusts and found that only 12 were allowing close relatives access to mental health in-patients. And it is clear that many acute hospitals are also failing to open their doors to the people whom their vulnerable patients need the most.\n\nThere are approximately 220 NHS hospital trusts; there are more than 15,000 care homes (with about 450,000 residents), and they have been given no clear guidance. Some of them are still allowing family carers in, with the obvious caveat that they follow strict procedures. Many have chosen to control infection by closing their doors \u2013 except in some cases, to receive patients discharged from hospital, even when they have had Covid-19, in order to free up hospital beds. On care home websites, there are statements of regret at the distress this may cause both to residents and to their families, and assurances that members of staff are doing their utmost to step into the yawning gap.\n\nI\u2019m sure the staff \u2013 the great, unsung army of men and women classed as \u201cunskilled\u201d who do the hardest job for the lowest pay and who now have to witness the daily anguish of those they look after \u2013 are doing their best. But there are approximately 120,000 vacancies in care homes, and a paid carer isn\u2019t a family carer, or a partner or spouse or daughter or son or grandchild. A paid carer isn\u2019t an intimate, can\u2019t be the memory, the gatekeeper, the beloved link to the familiar world.\n\nThe public has been asked to make sacrifices in these lockdown days. People with dementia have not been asked. Some are enduring an enforced isolation that is a violation of their fundamental human rights, and many of them simply do not understand why they can no longer see those they are close to. They ask for them and are refused. They feel abandoned and scared. Many will deteriorate, many will never recover from this deterioration. It will be terminal. There are other ways of dying than from the virus.\n\nThe pandemic isn\u2019t going away any time soon. People talk about months, even years. Time changes the meaning of isolation for someone who is old and vulnerable and who may not have much time left. It turns it into profound suffering. It shocks me that the close relative of someone with dementia is not allowed to see their loved one. Can\u2019t they be trusted to obey rules of hygiene, of social distancing, or to keep away from the home if they feel unwell? In hospital and residential settings, essential carers are just that \u2013 essential, as vital as the paid carer or the nurse or the doctor. There are many ways of dying, and many ways of saving a life.\n\nThe transformation of a home into a jail, which has led some relatives to turn to the law to try to break out their loved one, has been done for good motives, and in the name of protection. But such enforced loneliness is cruel and is wrong. It causes untold pain and harm. Children calling to their trapped parent through a fence, comforting them despairingly through a closed door. The helpless attempt at communication by phone, by Zoom. Last goodbyes by Skype. Death alone.\n\nThe virus has laid bare gross inequalities in the country. People living and dying with dementia \u2013 at home or in hospital or a care home \u2013 are among the most vulnerable in society, and they are also the easiest to ignore and forget.

Astonishingly, the AGM looks unlikely to host the usual scrap over executive pay, which just goes to show how the coronavirus pandemic has blown the doors off old certainties.\n\nShareholders will consider a new pay policy \u2013 proposed by a new head of the remuneration committee \u2013 while staff earning more than \u00a340,000 a year have agreed to a 20% cut in salary during at least April and May to save funds during the crisis.

Smaller chains of estate agents seem to be facing even more challenges, and many large rivals still need to devise escape routes.\n\nFoxtons\u2019 shares are, in effect, always a punt on the London housing market \u2013 which has been off-colour ever since the Brexit vote \u2013 and so holding them (even at these low levels) is an act of faith.

He was accompanied by a guard of honour and observed an airforce flypast, the only element of the military parade preserved this year.\n\nElsewhere some of the most committed got creative. Volunteers in Novosibirsk climbed cherry-pickers to sing war ballads to veterans on their balconies. News programmes urged families to mount images of veterans on their windows and take part in a national moment of silence at 7pm, followed by a rendition of the song Victory Day from their balconies.

Hassan Nasrallah had traditionally focused on affairs closer to home but now found himself thrust to the vanguard of Iran\u2019s interests in the region with a casting vote on who would best represent them.\n\nLast week, Kadhimi secured a government, thanks partly to Nasrallah\u2019s endorsement. Yet throughout the horse-trading that eventually secured his cabinet line-up, the gaping hole exposed by Suleimani\u2019s death was evident. \u201cThe Iranians and Iraqis are adrift,\u201d said a source with close ties to Iraqi and Hezbollah officials. \u201cThe vacuum is as huge as it was when Hajj Qassem was buried.\u201d\n\nSuch was the void caused by the death of Suleimani \u2013 dubbed Hajj Qassem by friend and foe \u2013 that nearly all the regional projects that had been under way in his name at the time have faltered. Sources in Iraq, Syria and Yemen in particular suggest that Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, and the Quds Force that projects its core interests, are struggling to maintain momentum.\n\nInterviews with Iraqi and Lebanese officials show his replacement, Esmail Ghaani, struggling to assert his authority, even after doing the rounds of Iraq\u2019s power base and the proxy networks that Suleimani had assembled over the 17 years of chaos that followed the US invasion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Esmail Ghaani at the funeral of Qassem Suleimani in Tehran in January.

On the same day, perhaps coincidentally, an Iranian publisher announced that Suleimani\u2019s memoirs from the Iran-Iraq war, titled Our Blessed Comrade, would soon be released. Even as Ghaani\u2019s backers tried to personalise him, his slain predecessor was eclipsing him from the grave.\n\nIn Iran, Suleimani\u2019s role \u2013 as intelligence chief, special forces commander and presidential envoy to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \u2013 has effectively been broken down. No one is likely to win such broad authority again. Without the weight of Suleimani, the Iranian-backed militia networks established over the past 17 years are proving difficult to manage.\n\nAs Kadhimi edged closer to the top job, supported also by the US and Saudi Arabia, both of whom saw him as a leader outside of Iran\u2019s grip on Iraq, he ran foul of one of Iraq\u2019s most powerful militias, Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, which has accused him of facilitating the US operation that killed Suleimani, and their leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, on a Baghdad road in the early hours of 3 January.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A boy in Tehran holds a portrait of Qassem Suleimani. Photograph: Vahid Salemi/AP\n\nIn a statement issued in early this month, the group said: \u201cDuring the sensitive times we are going through, the brothers in politics who brought Mustafa al-Kadhimi to be prime minister-designate should know before it\u2019s too late that the man is not up to the responsibility that has been given to him and is still accused of a crime of which he hasn\u2019t been acquitted.\u201d\n\nWeeks earlier, Kadhimi had sought a meeting with Keta\u2019ib Hezbollah\u2019s leadership under the auspices of Iraq\u2019s president, where he tried to assure them that he had played no role in the deaths, but left open the possibility that an official in the Iraqi National Intelligence Service might have had contact with US spies.\n\n\u201cThe informal agreement was that they would not stop him from getting the job, but would continue to talk out against him,\u201d said an official familiar with the conversation.\n\n\u201cKadhimi is facing so much pressure,\u201d said an official connected to the Iraqi presidency. \u201cThere are rows between the Shia parties, who don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on a lot. As for the Iranians, of course the loss of Muhandis and Qassem was a major blow; they\u2019re rearranging their structures now. But have they lost control? Not at all, the proof is their meddling in the formation.\u201d\n\nWith Kadhimi now Iraq\u2019s premier decision-maker, US and Saudi officials are privately hailing a new era of Iraqi sovereignty. Washington pushed its allies in the country\u2019s Kurdish north and Sunni centre to endorse him. \u201cThey think they\u2019ve got their man,\u201d a regional official said. \u201cThey\u2019re celebrating.

The brief show , which included Montecore, became the basis of an episode of the ABC television show 20/20.\n\nHorn and Siegfried Fischbacher, both natives of Germany, had first teamed up in 1957 and made their Las Vegas debut a decade later.

Their $10m compound was home to dozens of rare animals over the years. The white lions and white tigers were the result of a preservation program that began in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that the white tigers and white lions are going into the 21st century,\u201d Horn said in a 1999 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe bad news is that if we don\u2019t do something about the tigers in the wild, they will disappear.\u201d\n\nSiegfried & Roy\u2019s show, incorporating animal antics and magic tricks, included about 20 white tigers and lions, the number varying depending on the night.

Horn himself said later that he fainted and the tiger was trying to help him by dragging him offstage, though animal experts disputed that.\n\nBorn in Nordenham, Germany, Horn met Fischbacher on a cruise ship in 1957. Fischbacher performed the magic tricks, while Horn became his assistant, eventually suggesting using the cheetah in the act.\n\nThey honed their animal-magic show in small clubs in Germany and Switzerland in the mid-1960s. Their break came in a Monte Carlo casino when an agent in the audience invited them to Las Vegas. The pair made their debut at the Tropicana hotel-casino in the late 1960s.\n\nThe illusionists became popular in the 1970s, receiving their first star billing in 1978 as headliners of the Stardust\u2019s Lido de Paris.

That\u2019s the kind of stuff where you begin to get worried that basic \u2013 not just institutional norms \u2013 but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk.\n\n\u201cAnd when you start moving in those directions, it can accelerate pretty quickly as we\u2019ve seen in other places.\u201d\n\nThe president has repeatedly blamed Obama for the FBI investigation into Russian election interference which expanded to include links between his campaign and Moscow. Last week, Trump retweeted a conspiracy theorist who claimed Obama directed the investigation.\n\nOn Thursday Trump said at the White House: \u201cWhat they did, what the Obama administration did, is unprecedented \u2026 and I hope a lot of people will pay a big price because they are dishonest, crooked people. They are scum, human scum.\u201d\n\nThe president added: \u201c[Flynn] was targeted by the Obama administration, and he was targeted in order to try to take down a president.\u201d\n\nAfter nearly two years of work, special counsel Robert Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy but did detail extensive links between Trump aides and Russians and numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nTrump claims exoneration by Mueller. Mueller said he was not exonerating Trump.\n\nFlynn\u2019s guilty plea to lying to the FBI was one of Mueller\u2019s biggest coups. In 2017 Trump acknowledged it, writing on Twitter: \u201cI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice-President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\u201d\n\nAccording to Yahoo News, Obama told the web call the case made him feel a \u201csense of urgency\u201d about November\u2019s election, in which Trump is set to face Joe Biden, Obama\u2019s vice-president.\n\n\u201cWhenever I campaign,\u201d Obama reportedly said, \u201cI\u2019ve always said, \u2018Ah, this is the most important election.\u2019 Especially obviously when I was on the ballot, that always feels like it\u2019s the most important election. This one, I\u2019m not on the ballot but I am pretty darn invested. We got to make this happen.\u201d\n\nObama reportedly said the election would be about fighting \u201clong-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy [have] become a stronger impulse in American life\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason,\u201d he reportedly said, \u201cwhy the response to this global crisis [the coronavirus outbreak] has been so anaemic and spotty. It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset of \u2018what\u2019s in it for me\u2019 and \u2018to heck with everybody else\u2019, when that mindset is operationalised in our government.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, I, by the way, am going to be spending as much time as necessary and campaigning as hard as I can for Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nAs of Saturday morning, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, 1,283,762 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US, with 77,175 deaths. Encouraged by the White House, more than half the 50 states are seeking to reopen their shuttered economies, despite warnings from public health experts that it is too soon to do so without risking a high death toll.\n\nObama has followed precedent in not criticising his successor in the Oval Office in public but reports of his view of Trump are fairly regular. In January, for example, it was reported that he said Trump was a fascist.\n\nOn Saturday Trump was at the White House. He did not immediately respond to the Yahoo News report.\n\nHowever the attorney general, William Barr, perhaps spoke for the president earlier when he was asked how he thought history would view his decision to drop the Flynn case.\n\n\u201cWell, history is written by the winner,\u201d he told CBS News. \u201cSo it largely depends on who\u2019s writing the history.\u201d\n\n", "author": ["Martin Pengelly"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/brazils-president-bolsonaro-must-drastically-change-course-on-covid-19-says-the-lancet", "published": "2020-05-09T03:59:27", "title": "Brazil's President Bolsonaro must 'drastically change course' on Covid-19, says The Lancet", "text": "Brazil's President Bolsonaro must 'drastically change course' on Covid-19, says The Lancet\n\nThe biggest threat to Brazil\u2019s ability to successfully combat the spread of the coronavirus and tackle the unfolding public health crisis is the country\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, according to the British medical journal The Lancet.\n\nIn an editorial, The Lancet said his disregard for and flouting of lockdown measures was sowing confusion across Brazil, which reported a record number of Covid-19 deaths on Friday, and is fast emerging as one of the world\u2019s coronavirus hot spots.\n\nBrazil\u2019s health ministry on Friday registered 10,222 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 751 related deaths, beating the previous record of 615.

Corfield-Walters has run Book-ish for 10 years. It has 16 staff and a cafe, is the base for a literary festival that she also organises, and is credited with having played a major part in the regeneration of Crickhowell\u2019s award-winning high street. Above all, it is a highly successful business: 2019 was a record year. The fact that it would now again be a contender for the overall prize \u2013 to be announced in June at the British book awards \u2013 was for Corfield-Walters a hard-earned affirmation of a decade\u2019s passion and work.\n\nBut she was hardly celebrating. Britain was then five days from lockdown. \u201cIt was surreal,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d won best bookshop in Wales, yet I wasn\u2019t sure for how much longer I\u2019d have a shop that people could visit. It was like that scene in Star Wars when the walls are moving in, and the room\u2019s getting smaller and smaller. The goalposts were shifting every day. At first, we thought: OK, we\u2019ll buy hand sanitiser! But by the weekend, it was clear the shop would have to close.\u201d Her first thought was for her staff, who are \u201clike family\u201d to her; the government\u2019s subsequent announcement of its furlough scheme came as a huge relief. But there was also the question of her stock, and how she might keep selling it. Suddenly, the Book-ish website, hitherto used only to sell event tickets and signed copies, came into its own: \u201cOn the Saturday before lockdown began, we managed to get all 6,000 titles from the shop on to our website.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s life like now? Luckily, her wholesaler has remained open, and can help with the delivery of titles not in the shop. But mostly, she spends her days operating as a frantic one-woman postal machine: \u201cI\u2019m on my own here, fielding calls, tweets, Facebook, managing the website, and picking and packing, picking and packing.\u201d Her customers have been supportive. Some days, she sends out up to 50 parcels. However, this cannot make up for the shortfall in income that is the result of a closed shop and cafe. \u201cWe\u2019re about 50% down,\u201d she says. \u201cThough across the trade, that\u2019s relatively good. I\u2019m on the council of the Booksellers Association, and on average, those shops that are still able to send out books are making only about 18% of their normal sales.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emma Corfield-Walters, owner of Book-ish in Crickhowell, Wales. \u2018I\u2019ve been too scared to do cashflow projections.\u2019 Photograph: John Nguyen/PA\n\nWhat about reopening? Will this happen soon? She agrees there are good reasons for bookshops to be included in the first wave of non-essential businesses to reopen in any loosening of the lockdown; reading, as the World Health Organization notes, can boost mental health. But logistically, it\u2019s going to be difficult: \u201cI\u2019m not sure how we\u2019d open for browsing. Most independent shops are small. We\u2019re not chains; we don\u2019t have the infrastructure to make major changes in the way we operate. We\u2019re also community hubs. We had a very emotional conversation on Zoom yesterday at the Booksellers Network coffee morning. People were worrying about their vulnerable customers: the ones who come in for a glass of water, the older person who just wants a chat. How will this work with social distancing? Realistically, I can\u2019t see us opening before September.\u201d\n\nHow long can she keep going financially? For the first time in our conversation, she is briefly silent. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, at last. \u201cI\u2019ve been too scared to do cashflow projections. My landlord has been great, and reduced my rent. But I\u2019ve still got utilities bills and insurance to think about. If this level of sales carries on, I\u2019ll be able to pay my overheads. But if government support for the furlough scheme stops, there will be, across the trade, redundancies. That terrifies me.\u201d Does she expect some shops to close? \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I have friends at indies that have done so well in the past three years. They\u2019re so forward-thinking and creative. But if you\u2019ve rent to pay, and no website\u2026 \u201d What about her? Will Book-ish get out of this alive? She is determined that it will: \u201cWe\u2019re all in flight or fight mode at the moment \u2013 and I\u2019m fighting.\u201d\n\nWhen the lockdown began on 23 March, the ramifications for the book industry were extremely grave. Waterstones closed all 280 of its branches, its chief executive, James Daunt, having previously insisted the chain was no different to a pharmacy or a supermarket and would therefore stay open (the U-turn came after some staff complained they felt at risk, and had been given no protection or hand sanitiser). Britain\u2019s independent book stores also shut their doors (at the end of 2019, there were 890 such shops in the UK and Ireland). Supermarkets, which sell popular books in large quantities, focused their efforts on food and ceased ordering from publishers. Meanwhile, Amazon suddenly and dramatically \u201cde-prioritised\u201d book sales in favour of what it deemed to be essential goods (food, yes, but also, it would seem, hair dye and DIY equipment).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James Daunt, chief executive of Waterstones. \u2018Hopefully, customers can now see that online is not a monopoly.\u2019 Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian\n\nPeople were shocked. \u201cIt was a precipice at first,\u201d says Jeremy Trevathan, the publisher of Macmillan\u2019s adult division (he oversees Macmillan, Pan and Picador). \u201cWe thought: this is so grim.\u201d Jo Prior, managing director at Penguin General, felt the same way. \u201cIt was alarming and strange when the shops closed; very shocking and dramatic.\u201d Sales plummeted. \u201cSome publishers are saying they went down up to 60%,\u201d says Philip Jones, editor of the Bookseller.\n\nFor some it was even worse than that. The small presses, which have no marketing budget, depend on booksellers to press their titles into the hands of readers. \u201cBookshop sales are down by 90%,\u201d says Kevin Duffy, who runs Blue Moose, a publisher based in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific. We need the high street to open tomorrow. If it doesn\u2019t happen by September, we\u2019re going to be in dire straits.\u201d\n\nApproaches to the emergency varied. At Macmillan, executives took voluntary pay cuts on a sliding scale from 20% rising to 50% (its managing director, Anthony Forbes Watson, took a 50% cut). Only three staff were furloughed. At Faber, on the other hand, the sales team has been furloughed almost in its entirety; the publishing schedule having been radically reduced, the work wasn\u2019t there for people to do, while its international sales team cannot currently travel, which makes their jobs difficult. At Penguin, some employees have been furloughed, but \u201cpatchily\u201d, across the business. \u201cI\u2019ve furloughed members of my communications team,\u201d says Prior. \u201cWe\u2019re resting them because they were working on books that are now delayed.\u201d\n\nHow many books have been delayed? Again, the picture isn\u2019t consistent (though spooked newspaper literary editors will testify to the scale of the shift; at one point about a month ago, the volume of books coming in for review was noticeably dwindling). While some have pushed the publication of new titles into the autumn, others have moved them into 2021. \u201cWe did take the decision to move off a huge amount into July and the autumn,\u201d says Prior. \u201cNot everything: the new Lee Child has just come out. Mrs Hinch [the Instagram cleaning expert] is doing well. But most things \u2013 things that are dependent on physical retail for support \u2013 will be published when we expect shops to be open.\u201d At Faber, most of its list has been moved on. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned the dial, pushing everything on three or four months,\u201d says Stephen Page, its chief executive. \u201cBut we\u2019ve put most literary debuts, which need the oxygen of booksellers, into 2021, because the autumn is going to be so crowded.\u201d All this isn\u2019t without risk. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what the autumn is going look like,\u201d says Philip Jones. \u201cThere are no guarantees. But even if things are close to normal, the danger is that many of these books may get lost in the trample.\u201d\n\nA recent survey suggested that 40% of people say that books have helped them get through the lockdown\n\nHow soon will the high street reopen? \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of chatter,\u201d says Daunt. \u201cBut we need to be told when we can reopen, and no one from government has been in touch.\u201d Is he making preparations? \u201cYes. It requires a lot of operational thought: a lot of training and investment. It\u2019s a far from trivial exercise. How do you ensure your staff are protected and customers properly informed?\u201d Unlike the independents, Waterstones branches are relatively big. \u201cThere\u2019s never a great intensity to book shopping outside of December, and we have tables, which can act as a means of ensuring social distance. Still, it\u2019s extremely challenging. Every part of retail will be different. Bookselling is our profession and our vocation; we want to be open. But we don\u2019t want to do it prematurely, or to be out of sync with our customers. Some places are not going to be busy for a while: out-of-town shopping centres, our big metropolitan city-centre shops; people aren\u2019t going to want to get on the underground to go to Piccadilly to buy a book.\u201d Nevertheless, he is upbeat. \u201cWe are profitable and well run; we have been through hard times before. But also, we have something people really want to buy.\u201d\n\nThis much is certainly true. In the days before the lockdown began, Waterstones reported a 17% uplift in sales, a rise that has only grown in the weeks since; a central irony, for publishers, has been that in the moment when books have been suddenly more difficult to get hold of, demand for them has never been higher. A recent survey suggested that 40% of people say that books have helped them get through the lockdown. All publishers report a dramatic increase in traffic on their websites, and in ebook and audio sales. Online sales at Waterstones are growing 30% each day; as I write they are up some 1,500%, a long line of Royal Mail trucks queuing outside its warehouse every night, where there used only to be one. \u201cIt\u2019s still a relatively small proportion of the sales that were coming out of our shops,\u201d says Daunt. \u201cBut hopefully, customers can now see that online is not a monopoly.\u201d Publishers are unsurprisingly thrilled by this. Can Amazon\u2019s monopoly be broken? \u201cOne thing that must come out of this is a model where online selling is more plural,\u201d says Stephen Page.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Literary agent Jonny Geller. \u2018I\u2019ve been saying this for 20 years: why not go into direct selling?\u2019 Photograph: Curtis Brown\n\nPublishers are cagey about the idea of getting into selling themselves. Some dismiss the idea out of hand: it\u2019s too complex and too expensive; they don\u2019t want to anger Amazon. Others, off the record, agree that the industry is having this conversation. It has been forcefully brought home to them, Amazon having, as Philip Jones puts it, \u201cturned off the tap\u201d of supply so suddenly, that they have grown too dependent on it; that the supply chain is too fragile. \u201cThis is the moment,\u201d says Jonny Geller, a literary agent who represents, among others, John le Carr\u00e9, Howard Jacobson and Elif Shafak. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying this to them [publishers] for 20 years: why do you not go into direct selling? You have the data, the bookclubs, the websites. Previously, they just preferred to pump money into ailing chains, but I think they\u2019re now being forced to consider it \u2013 and if this situation goes on much longer, they will have to.\u201d He sounds frustrated. \u201cTelevision, which is much more expensive to make, has worked out how to deliver content to people. Publishing is just clinging to the same model it had in 1920. When Tony Parsons\u2019s new novel came out [Parsons is another of Geller\u2019s clients], you couldn\u2019t get hold of his book \u2013 but on the same day, I ordered a badminton kit from Amazon that arrived the following morning.\u201d\n\nWriters are well equipped. They\u2019re experiencing what they always experience: self-isolation Jonny Geller, literary agent\n\nGeller is also critical of the decision of publishers to push back their schedules. \u201cThey\u2019re concentrating too much on furloughing and saving and hunkering down. It\u2019s such a narrow approach, everything in the deep freeze. Another of my clients, Alastair Campbell [Tony Blair\u2019s former press secretary], has written a very powerful book about depression. It was planned for spring, now it will come out in August or September. I\u2019m troubled by this. If there was ever a time for a book of this kind, it\u2019s now. I think this is where morale is low for authors \u2013 and if publishers had invested better in distribution, we wouldn\u2019t be having these debates. They\u2019d just be publishing as usual.\u201d How are writers responding to the changes and uncertainty? \u201cThey\u2019re well equipped. They\u2019re experiencing what they always experience: self-isolation. But it\u2019s also hard to know what to write, what\u2019s relevant. That\u2019s the deeper question. And I do feel desperately sorry for some of those being published now. For many of them, publication has just gone by.\u201d Authors whose books have been published during this time have mixed feelings about it. \u201cI\u2019m publishing into a big, black hole,\u201d Lionel Shriver tells me, though she adds that her sense of \u201cpersonal loss\u201d is valuable in writerly terms: she better understands what so many others are going through. But for some, it is, if they\u2019re honest, a boon in terms of coverage, if not in sales: with fewer books being published, less obvious titles are more likely to be reviewed.\n\nThis said, writers cannot look forward, this year, to going out into the world to talk about their books. Literary festivals are a major victim of the virus. Hay and Edinburgh fell early, and others followed. Cheltenham, held in October, is still booking writers. But it\u2019s hard to see, realistically, how it can go ahead; social distancing will not allow for crowds in muggy tents. \u201cA few weeks ago, we were still planning to deliver a physical festival this autumn,\u201d says Sarah-Jane Roberts, the co-director of the Manchester literature festival. \u201cBut the ongoing uncertainties and concerns around the pandemic has made this more unlikely. We\u2019re deeply disappointed, and though we\u2019re resilient as a festival, and have a wonderful team of trustees and partnership organisations, we do worry about the next few years, and the long-term effects of losing a year\u2019s box office.\u201d\n\nThe next 12 months are, she believes, going be highly challenging for the festival community. Lots of action around events has moved online. Emma Corfield-Walters has got together with three other independents \u2013 Forum Books in Corbridge, Booka Books of Oswestry and Linghams, Heswall \u2013 to produce a series of events on Facebook Live (authors who have appeared so far include Robert Webb and Marian Keyes). Today sees the conclusion of The Big Book Weekend, a virtual festival organised by writer Kit de Waal and Molly Flatt of the Bookseller, produced in association with BBC Arts, which featured 27 author events, each of which should have taken place at a cancelled festival. But while these initiatives are spirited, popular and may sell books, there\u2019s no ticket revenue in online. They are no substitute, either, for a shared experience; for the sound of applause and the prospect of a drink, a bun or a deckchair later.\n\nThere\u2019s light at the end of that tunnel, and the indies have been incredible, delivering books by skateboard and so on Jeremy Travathan, Macmillan\n\nPhilip Jones has edited The Bookseller since 2012. \u201cI\u2019m often accused of being a Pollyanna when it comes to the trade,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this period has challenged even me. Wherever you turn, something\u2019s damaged.\u201d What\u2019s striking, however, is the positivity to be found almost everywhere. Sales have begun to recover. \u201cThe supermarkets and Amazon are getting back to normal,\u201d says Jeremy Travathan. \u201cThere\u2019s light at the end of that tunnel, and the indies have been incredible, delivering books by skateboard and so on. We kept on our sales reps, the better to support them. A great thing that has come out of this has to do with the ecosystem. In normal times, you\u2019re negotiating to get the best deal you can. It can be tense and difficult. But now we\u2019re working with retailers and printers to make sure they\u2019re OK, while authors and agents are being incredibly thoughtful about things like cashflow. As a company, I don\u2019t think we are nervous about the future. Commercial fiction is doing very well, but even in literary fiction, we don\u2019t feel things are dire. We assume, like the government, that the market will be down 70% this quarter, and 50% in the third. But we predict that the fourth will be close to normal.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jo Prior of Penguin. \u2018We want our website to be more of a destination.\u2019 Photograph: Penguin Books\n\nFunding for prizes is going to be a worry in the future, and literacy charities are going to find the landscape much more severe. \u201cThe arts are going to have to fight so hard,\u201d says Jo Prior, who is chair of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction and a trustee of the National Literacy Trust. \u201cCorporate funding is going to be difficult to come by, and we haven\u2019t even begun to see the impact on organisations like the NLT, which do so much brilliant work.\u201d But \u2013 and this is surely the most significant point \u2013 there is a sense that this period has given many in the industry new perspectives (and, perhaps, a kick up the backside). For Stephen Page of Faber, for instance, working from home, about which he used to be sceptical, has caused him to think about how publishing might be more inclusive. \u201cTown hall stuff is difficult [when people are at home],\u201d he says. \u201cBut one thing that has occurred to us has to do with regionality. The vast majority of people who work at Faber now have to be able to get into the office [in Bloomsbury], but this experience shows people can work from anywhere \u2013 and a more distributed workforce means a more inclusive workforce. That\u2019s an interesting thought.\u201d The lockdown has also accelerated companies\u2019 thinking about online. \u201cWe\u2019re learning better to connect with readers,\u201d says Prior. \u201cWe want our website to be more of a destination. People are loving our Penguin Perspectives series [in which the likes of Nick Hornby and Philip Pullman write about the issues of the day]. Publishers can introduce writers to people in an unmediated way: that has become real in this period, and I think it will be lasting.\u201d\n\nAbove all, this time of seclusion has put the book centre stage once again; it has not seemed so alive, or so vital, in many years. \u201cPeople need stories,\u201d says Kevin Duffy. \u201cThey take comfort in them.\u201d He points to the success of Blue Moose\u2019s Leonard and Hungry Paul by R\u00f3n\u00e1n Hession, a novel about two ordinary men, and kindness. \u201cPeople have told me that in lockdown this has been a balm for their souls. I get emails on a daily basis thanking me for it.\u201d Beyond their anxiety, I sense in those I talk to a certain excitement; a recalibration of sorts. \u201cThe last four or five years in publishing have been great,\u201d says Stephen Page. \u201cWe\u2019re in mourning for them. But you can only dwell on that for a few moments before you say: the reading and the writing are still there. Original work will come out of this lockdown, just as it did out of austerity; it has shone a light on globalisation, and the inconveniences that we have, to a degree forgotten, like mortality.\u201d He and I are talking via the screens of our laptops, and though his face keeps freezing, I can see how strongly he feels. \u201cWe are going to have change,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel sure this is a [permanently] changed environment. But my vocation as a publisher feels very central and important. Reading has had an exciting six weeks. It\u2019s breathing for some people. Now we just have to figure out the next bit.\u201d", "author": ["Rachel Cooke"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/10/never-rarely-sometimes-always-review-profoundly-moving-abortion-drama-eliza-hittman-sidney-flanigan", "published": "2020-05-10T07:00:19", "title": "Never Rarely Sometimes Always review - profoundly moving abortion drama", "text": "From Eliza Hittman, the remarkable writer-director of It Felt Like Love and Beach Rats, comes another drama that manages to blend the gritty authenticity of a documentary with the poetic sensibility of pure cinema. In her impressively measured and beautifully understated third feature, Hittman tells an oft-hidden story of reproductive rights \u2013 an age-old issue that has urgent contemporary relevance. Yet Never Rarely Sometimes Always never feels polemical. On the contrary, it is perhaps best described as a perfectly observed portrait of female friendship; a coming-of-age story with road-movie inflections, piercingly honest and deeply affecting.\n\nFeature first-timer (and accomplished musician) Sidney Flanigan is superb as Autumn, a 17-year-old from Pennsylvania who discovers that she cannot get an abortion in her home town without parental consent. Quietly desperate, Autumn reluctantly confides in her more outgoing cousin Skylar (rising star Talia Ryder, soon to be seen in Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story), who agrees to accompany her across state lines to New York. The pair imagine that the trip will be brief but find themselves spending days and nights on the streets, waiting for the procedure that Autumn was denied in Pennsylvania.\n\nHittman has described her films as \u2018a narrative about a girl carrying around a lot of pain and burden, and the loneliness of it all\u2019\n\nInspired by \u201cthese untold journeys that women take\u201d (Ann Rossiter\u2019s Ireland\u2019s Hidden Diaspora: The \u201cAbortion Trail\u201d and the Making of a London-Irish Underground, 1980-2000 apparently proved an instructive work), Hittman\u2019s drama may be fictional, but it is firmly rooted in factual research. Like Kitty Green\u2019s current release The Assistant, everything about Never Rarely Sometimes Always has a matter-of-fact veracity: from heartbreaking early scenes in which we see Autumn helplessly punching her own bruised stomach to her very different experiences at a pregnancy centre in Pennsylvania and a Planned Parenthood clinic in Brooklyn.\n\nIndeed, in the pivotal scene from which the film takes its title, it is not an actor but a real counsellor, Kelly Chapman, who asks Autumn about her history, her health, her safety, using a series of set questions to which those multiple choice answers apply. Autumn\u2019s responses, which include significant silences, speak volumes not only about her own experiences but about those of so many women who find themselves in a similar situation.\n\nBrief scenes of anti-abortion activists picketing clinics remind us of the crisis facing women\u2019s rights in Trump\u2019s increasingly retrogressive America. Yet, as with her previous features, Hittman\u2019s primary focus is her characters \u2013 their lives, their experiences, their dreams and disappointments. Early scenes of Autumn and Skylar in their home town, where both work part-time in the local grocery store, are an object lesson in how to convey vast amounts of information with minimal dialogue; snapshots of an environment that has shaped the lives of these two very different characters.\n\nMeet the new hotshots of American film-making Read more\n\nSignificant, too, that the only time Autumn really seems to verbalise her feelings is when she plays a solo version of He\u2019s Got the Power at the school talent contest, turning the Exciters\u2019 upbeat 60s hit into a plaintive ballad (\u201cHe makes me do things I don\u2019t wanna do\u201d), provoking cries of derision from the audience, followed by an awful moment of emptiness, and then a steely continuation through barely restrained tears.\n\nHittman has described Never Rarely Sometimes Always as \u201ca narrative about a girl carrying around a lot of pain and burden, and the loneliness of it all\u201d. That loneliness is certainly a key part of the film\u2019s emotional palette, captured with great insight and understanding. Yet ultimately it is the growing bond between Autumn and Skylar that sticks in the mind, beautifully expressed in a strange moment of silent hand-holding that quite took my breath away.\n\nPlaudits to French cinematographer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Louvart, who did such sensual work on Beach Rats, and who here manages to capture moments of intense intimacy in unobtrusive fashion. In a film in which so much is expressed through minute gestures, Louvart keeps a remarkable balance between the geography of these characters\u2019 faces and that of the ever-changing landscape through which they pass. Through her camera, we become both observers and participants \u2013 watching these young women\u2019s lives but also empathetically experiencing their shared journeys.\n\nThe result is a film that combines the melancholy magic of John Schlesinger\u2019s Midnight Cowboy with the humanist artfulness of the Dardenne brothers\u2019 finest neorealist works. Perfectly pitched and sensitively played, this is truthful, powerful and profoundly moving fare from a film-maker at the very top of her game.", "author": ["Mark Kermode"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/focus/2020/may/10/the-va-in-10-objects-from-brexit-vases-to-beyonces-butterfly-ring", "published": "2020-05-10T08:11:19", "title": "The V&A in 10 objects: from Brexit vases to Beyonc\u00e9's butterfly ring", "text": "It is pretty dusty in South Kensington at the moment. Without millions of visitors wandering through the V&A galleries, the dust begins to settle and the past takes over. Under the steely eye of Vernon Rapley, head of security, our objects are resting safely at the moment. But the purpose of a museum is predicated upon dialogue and difference: the interaction between citizen and object, the journey into a web of histories, and then the flourishing of curiosity.\n\n\u201cUnvisited museums dwindle into very sleepy and useless institutions,\u201d said our first director Henry Cole, who was an early proponent of blockbuster exhibitions.\n\nToday, our galleries remain in lockdown, starved of conversation. So I am delighted to be able to explore some of their most celebrated objects with readers of the Observer - who are, after all, their ultimate owners. And what becomes immediately apparent is the incredible diversity of the V&A\u2019s collection \u2013 from ceramics to furniture to digital design to photography to fashion to fine art.\n\nA little unfairly, Cole described the museum as \u201ca refuge for destitute collections\u201d; Roy Strong called it \u201can extremely capacious handbag\u201d. Yet what unites the 2.7 million objects held by the V&A is ingenuity and imagination: from Grayson Perry\u2019s Brexit vases to Raphael\u2019s cartoons, the museum is a vault of human inventiveness placed on display to inspire the imagination of today\u2019s creative pioneers. Yes, there is the sublime and the beautiful in our galleries, but there has always been this sense of mission about using the artefacts to encourage the power of making. William Morris spoke of visiting the V&A and being \u201cfilled with wonder and gratitude at the beauty which has been born from the brain of man\u201d.\n\nMuseums and galleries across the world have used the Covid-19 crisis to broaden their online programmes and connect with new audiences. Digital provision will be an important part of the future, but there remains something magical about the aura of the real, authentic object. Stephen Greenblatt has written of \u201cthe power of the displayed object to reach out beyond its formal boundaries to a larger world, to evoke in the viewer the complex, dynamic cultural forces from which it has emerged and for which it may be taken by a viewer to stand\u201d. So we look forward to Observer readers coming back to South Kensington and standing before these objects \u2013 and hopefully this list will remind us of just what we have all been missing.\n\nThe Raphael cartoons (1515-16) Commissioned by Pope Leo X, Raphael\u2019s designs for ten tapestries to hang in the Sistine Chapel have been on loan to the V&A from the Royal Collection since Queen Victoria removed them from Hampton Court in the 1860s in memory of her beloved Albert. Charting episodes from the lives of Saints Peter and Paul, the drawings are among the most sumptuous works of the High Renaissance. They speak not only to Raphael\u2019s artistic genius, but also the way in which he transformed tapestry design in the 16th century.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raphael cartoon, The Miraculous Draught of Fishes. Photograph: Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n\nThis year marks the 500th anniversary of the death of Raphael and, in addition to refurbishing the Raphael Court, we have begun a new digital research project which is unearthing a radical new understanding of his craftsmanship and studio practice.\n\nThe Painter\u2019s Two Daughters by Thomas Gainsborough (1758) I adore this painting, which sits very modestly in our British Galleries, for its intimacy, humanity and frightening air of innocent fatalism. The picture has a distinct echo of Van Dyck, whose portraits of children also had a melancholy sweetness.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Painter\u2019s Two Daughters by Thomas Gainsborough. Photograph: Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nGainsborough\u2019s daughters were around 10 and six years old and shown in close sisterly contact with each other, linked by Mary\u2019s arm stretching up to rest on Margaret\u2019s hair (the girls\u2019 hair would have been cut in this short style to fit neatly under mob caps). Margaret turns to face us, catching our eye with an almost haughty, if mournful expression.\n\nThe Man-Tiger Organ, or Tipu\u2019s Tiger (1794-99) A V&A favourite, this carved, wooden masterpiece depicts a European officer having his neck ripped open by a crouching tiger. Inside is an organ, which makes an eerie wailing noise while the soldier raises his arm in pain.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tipu\u2019s Tiger. Photograph: Kitcatt, Mike/Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n\nPerhaps commissioned by Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore, for his young sons who had been taken hostage by the British, it was initially a symbol of resistance. But after the defeat of Tipu, it was taken as booty from Sultan\u2019s palace and displayed in London as an icon of imperialism. It is a daily reminder of the V&A\u2019s relationship to the colonial past.\n\nCopy of Trajan\u2019s Column (1864) The largest object in our collection is a copy. But not a fake. The plaster cast of Trajan\u2019s Column reproduces the Roman original, a triumphal monument built to commemorate Emperor Trajan\u2019s victory in the Dacian wars. The casts are wrapped around a brick chimney, which you can now step inside (or, indeed, abseil down).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Copy of Trajan\u2019s Column. Photograph: Peter Kelleher/Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n\nIt dominates our Cast Courts, which brought together highlights of European sculpture to enable the Victorian public to see the wonders of Rome and Florence even if they could not visit for themselves. In the mid-19th century, the V&A pioneered all the modern techniques of photography, electrotyping and plaster casts to democratise popular access to high culture.\n\nThe Age of Bronze by Auguste Rodin (1880) Rodin\u2019s magnificent donation of 18 of his sculptures in 1914 remains the greatest gift to the V&A made by a living artist. Inspired by the works of Donatello and Michelangelo, the title alludes to the era after the Stone Age, when humanity finally became creative and \u201cadvanced\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Age of Bronze by Auguste Rodin. Photograph: Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n\nWhen first exhibited the nude was so lifelike that Rodin was accused of having cast it from life. The gift was a celebration of Rodin\u2019s belief in Anglo-French solidarity: \u201cYour soldiers are fighting side by side with ours. As a little token of my admiration for your heroes I decided to present the collection to the V&A. That is all.\u201d\n\nFold-up chair, by Eileen Gray (1930s) Gray was one of the most intriguing designers of the interwar period and is nowadays considered an important proponent of Modernism. The S-bend chair - so named for the shape of the base, armrests and back \u2013 was designed for her Riviera summer residency and shows her commitment to simplicity, pragmatism and an honesty to materials.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fold-up chair, by Eileen Gray. Photograph: Robert Auton/Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n\nA collaborator with Le Corbusier and pioneer of modern living patterns at a time when the interior increasingly became an expression of self, Gray was overlooked for much of the 20th century by her male colleagues. More recently, she has been heralded \u201cas an architect and interior decorator \u2026 for lesbian living\u201d.\n\nEvening ensemble by Elsa Schiaparelli (1937) Donated to the V&A by Cecil Beaton as part of his major fashion gift to the museum, a Schiaparelli couture evening suit was widely regarded as the Rolls-Royce of the dressmaking trade.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Evening ensemble by Elsa Schiaparelli. Photograph: Richard Davis/Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n\nPurchased by the society fixture Alexandra Trevor-Roper, Lady Dacre from her London showroom, the jacket is made of burgundy silk velvet, with a tour-de-force embroidery incorporating rhinestones, sequins and silver-gilt thread. The ensemble\u2019s luxurious textile, masterful tailoring and fine surface embellishment represent a high-water mark of 1930s haute couture. Generously, the suit was simply dropped off at the V&A in 1971 with a note: \u201cSchiaparelli Suit, 1937. To be returned if not wanted.\u201d\n\nRobin Hood Gardens by Alison and Peter Smithson in Poplar, east London (1972) This is one of Britain\u2019s greatest examples of Brutalist heritage. Richar d Rogers compared the council estate to Bath\u2019s Royal Crescent, and Zaha Hadid always admired it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robin Hood Gardens. Photograph: Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n\nHowever, in 2009, after decades of municipal neglect and a spirited campaign to grant it listed status and save it, Robin Hood Gardens was condemned. In 2017, when it was eventually demolished, the V&A preserved a nine-metre-high section of the western block, including a portion of \u201cstreet in the sky\u201d, a feature that the Smithsons hoped would incorporate the conviviality of East End street life into their design.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s Papillon ring (2016) Given to the V&A by Beyonc\u00e9 in 2018, the Papillon ring is an ingenious design by the jeweller Glenn Spiro. Originally made as a brooch, it was adapted into a ring when it was found that the wings, unencumbered by mounts, could easily be encouraged to flutter.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Papillon ring designed by Glenn Spiro. Photograph: Robert Auton/Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n\nA concealed mechanism in the diamond-encrusted band mobilises this movement through the gentle flexing of the wearer\u2019s finger, whereupon the ring comes to life amid the glitter and sparkle of green garnets, diamonds, titanium and white gold. When flexed in this way, the masterly, almost invisible, mounting of the stones is revealed on the underside of the wings. I so enjoyed writing a thank you note beginning, \u201cDear Ms Knowles\u2026\u201d\n\nGrayson Perry\u2019s Brexit vases (2017) This Matching Pair of vases were made in 2017 amid the political turbulence caused by Brexit. In this respect they participate in a longstanding tradition of pottery with political messages.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matching Pair, two ceramic vases by Grayson Perry. Photograph: Robert Auton/Victoria and Albert Museum London\n\nThese monumental vases, however, strive to be non-partisan in reflecting strong similarities between the two divided camps. The blue colour of the glaze that harmonises the pair was a direct consequence of the crowd-sourcing technique that Perry used to decorate the vases. Apart from their favourite colour, he canvassed Remain and Leave voters for selfies and British symbols including personalities such as Gandhi, Shakespeare, Jo Cox, Nigel Farage, Gary Lineker, Winston Churchill and the Queen, all of whom make an appearance on the vases.\n\nTristram Hunt is director of the Victoria & Albert Museum.

Photograph: Jahnay Tennai\n\nChip, Skepta and Young Adz are all very respected in the UK scene. For them to come together and do an album, I think it\u2019s a sick project and it demonstrated a lot of art. It\u2019s a fusion of trap and drill and they also have deep hip-hop records on there. The track High Road, where Chip is talking about not being a drug dealer and being an influential person in his area, that\u2019s the thing I\u2019ve always aspired to in my music, it\u2019s a very positive message.

A couple of years on and writer Peter Bowker\u2019s creation of Joe, the marvellous young Max Vento, continues to cause tumults of heart-sorry love, bite-the-walls frustration, wry laughter and wry sobs amid his family, amid those stunning northern fells, and now amid a backdrop of splintered parents living apart. And every parent, never mind every parent of an A-word (autistic) child, can surely grasp the import of the word \u201cchange\u201d on the young, even the apparently invulnerable.\n\nJoe is 10 now, and coping with change by dumping his headphones, and his dad\u2019s beloved MP3d punk, which the two of them used to share, when he thinks he\u2019s not \u201chome\u201d. As indeed he\u2019s not, any more. Paul and Alison live 100 miles apart, in new places: a squat, lakeside, stone cottage for Paul (Lee Ingleby); a cheap-swish, Manc dockside mezzanine for Alison (Morven Christie). Christopher Eccleston, still managing to keep his performance just the right side of comedic, cliched \u201cfit northern granda\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s quite a skill, and finely borne \u2013 is still portrayed as the galumphing, tactless one, but now I\u2019m less sure: his boots-on approach to Joe seems to bear more fruit than Paul\u2019s wriggling, passive empathy and Alison\u2019s controlling righteousness, which after all led to that split.\n\nAs often with this series, the lens that shines on the differently abled \u2013 Joe, and Ralph, the son with Down\u2019s syndrome (a phenomenal Leon Harrop) of granda Maurice\u2019s love interest \u2013 only serves to refract the limitations of the word \u201cnormal\u201d when applied to adults. Expect also some standout work from (of course) Julie Hesmondhalgh, who very soon comes into her own as Joe\u2019s teacher, and Molly Wright as sister Rebecca, the only person Joe fully \u201cgets\u201d, now threatening more change via an accidental uni pregnancy, the ramifications of which Joe will cope with by obsessing about car-seat rights. As, actually, one well might.\n\nHardly to be outdone, ITV shone with Isolation Stories, the first serious TV dramas to be made under lockdown. Jeff Pope and his writers (Gaby Chiappe, William Ivory, Neil McKay), under strictures that meant everything had to be filmed by partners or co-quarantined similars, and overseen remotely by Zoom or some such, managed to give us almost a full week of edgy and delightful drama that will surely be referred back to by chroniclers of these times.\n\nA handful of intriguing 15-minute scripts, a handful of fine actors, filmed at home, with occasional split-screens to reflect the ongoing frustrations of lockdown \u2013 co-workers here, a therapist there \u2013 and who needs ritzy, pricey locations any more? One might ask.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018A great venture\u2019: Sheridan Smith in Isolation Stories. Photograph: ITV\n\nWhat struck about the entire week was the difference in needs. Some \u2013 and what happened to them in childhood to make them so needy? \u2013 sobbed on phone-camera, or wheedled, or boasted. Some, er, simply coped. All British life was here. And one or two of those who were proudest of the coping were, simply, found wanting. As I might have mentioned, life is messy. This was a great venture, helped immensely by Sheridan Smith and young Tom Glenister.\n\nThe Eddy, parlayed in a kind of mongrel Franglais-Arabic on the backstreets of Paris \u2013 the shonky suburbs beyond the tracks of the Petite Ceinture that also formed so many settings for Spiral \u2013 is something of a labour of love, all about a dingy, tottering jazz club kept alive through force of personality and sweet, soulful music. The actors either are musicians, or have learned so to become, and it has behind it director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land) and, as writer, our own Jack Thorne.\n\nIt\u2019s not short on style. The sax player, for instance, has one of those make-your-mind-up beards only ever encountered in one of two manifestations: a hot, young, black sax player dishing it out in a dirty, basement jazz club in Paris or a Belgian mime artist. The three-generation jazz lovers in the immigration squats of Paris, grandmother beside grandson, have mastered the Arabic art of singing with a smouldering fag between the lips. It feels stylish yet true, and so it\u2019s a welcome universe away from last week\u2019s Netflix Hollywood thing, with its rip-off credo that \u201cstyle\u201d can be had for a cheap, raffia trilby and a poster of a trumpet.\n\nNot short on style, but that\u2019s part of the problem. The moody shots, the endless rehearsals, the fiddly, stop-start tuning\u2026 I loved it, but even I accept it could have done with a plot. So far, Chazelle seems to be showrunning by draping good jazz on top of a trepanned basic story, about an exiled African American and his stroppy daughter and some Serbian money-goons. It remains to be seen whether Thorne will in future weeks flex his undoubted writing muscles, or bow and take the back seat to his weighty, garlanded director\u2019s singular (if plot-thin) vision.\n\nThat all said, if Chazelle\u2019s La La Land was bubblegum jazz (which it avowedly was, quite unlike Whiplash, which approached the music like a grown-up), then this is the stuff of cheroots and switchblades. And jazz bounces a little higher once more on its newly healthy tendril, which is the hope of rescue from cliched irrelevance and wilful misunderstanding.\n\nTrying is Apple TV+\u2019s first dedicated comedy, apparently, and rather good for what it is. What it is is something about a north London couple trying to adopt, and a refreshingly non-Richard Curtis London couple, for what\u2019s sure to be a global viewership, or as much as Apple TV+ can depend on a global viewership, which is frankly not yet much.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, genuinely, with some very good lines. Rafe Spall as Jason excels as one half of the trying couple, lugubrious and staunchly anti-intellectual, yet half-wise. Where it falls down, and certainly not with the actor, Esther Smith (Nikki), is in the tweeness of characterisation. In 2005 film critic Nathan Rabin coined, not entirely unkindly, the phrase \u201cmanic pixie dream girl\u201d for a certain type of heroine, and Nikki\u2019s certainly that \u2013 dungarees, breezy kookiness, squirrels and rainbows.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rafe Spall and \u2018manic pixie dream girl\u2019 Esther Smith in Trying. Photograph: Apple TV+\n\nUnfortunately, this all spills over into the adoption process, with Nikki constantly trying to better herself (reading Dostoevsky, attending lectures with three highlighter pens) rather than Just Being Herself. Which will win in the long run. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s rather good, but it irritated, with its cliched (bad) books versus (good) carefree-beach vibe, when there\u2019s no quandary. It\u2019s not a zero-sum game.\n\nClaire Danes on the end of Homeland: 'It was so nice to play such a badass' Read more\n\nHomeland, which ended its long and breathless run last week, allegedly for ever, was \u2013 for those who stuck the distance \u2013 a gift-yielding, immense reward, not least in its uncanny ability to spot some tendencies early: troll farms, fake news, presidents sacking wholesale their intelligence departments, unintelligently. It had to go wrong somewhere, and this last outing, featuring a nuclear standoff on the Pakistan border, hardly chimed with current worries \u2013 but it hardly mattered, so good has been the perennial play-off between mentor Saul and hustling renegade Carrie.\n\nI can\u2019t quite believe I shall be seeing no longer that platonic double-crossing double act of Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin, which near-concluded with Carrie ensconced in Moscow and Saul still alive both despite and because of his stubbornness. It actual-concluded a while later, Carrie slipping Saul high-grade intelligence in the spine of a book, and thank whew: never had I seen her so ill at ease as living a settled, charmed, moneyed life, with gowns and concerts and jewels.

Now new illustrations of the classic picture book Not Now, Bernard have been created to better reflect the daily life of families in the age of smartphones and tablets.\n\nThey show the protagonist Bernard\u2019s parents paying more attention to their digital devices than their son \u2013 even when he is eaten and replaced by a raucous purple monster from the garden.\n\nThe publishers hope the new version, which is being released on 4 June to celebrate the book\u2019s 40th anniversary, will appeal to all those parents spending the lockdown shouting \u201cnot now!\u201d at their kids as they try to work from home.\n\n\u201cI know there are more reasons now \u2013 because there are more electronic things \u2013 that people say \u2018not now\u2019,\u201d said the author and illustrator David McKee, 85. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit sad... But we humans continue to make the same mistakes.\u201d\n\nHe was speaking to the Observer from his partner\u2019s home near Marseille in France, where he has spent the last month gardening, painting \u2013 and struggling to concentrate. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a normal life. I was brought up during the war. Everything was shared and people were united. This business of lockdown \u2013 with everyone supposed to be wearing masks and keeping their distance, even from friends \u2013 it separates people.\u201d\n\nHe thinks listening to children is one of the most important things a parent can do \u2013 and during the lockdown, when children are isolated from their teachers and friends, it is even more important. \u201cIf they\u2019re good parents, they\u2019ve got to make sure during this time that they do listen, that they do say: \u2018Yes, what is it?\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David McKee, author of Not Now, Bernard, also created children\u2019s characters such as Elmer the Patchwork Elephant and Mr Benn. Photograph: Pal Hansen/The Observer\n\nAt the very least, he says parents should take the time to explain to their child why they are unavailable, if they are busy. One of the great jokes of the book is that neither Bernard nor the monster understand why their interruptions are constantly met with indifference from Bernard\u2019s parents. \u201cAt the end, the monster doesn\u2019t know how to handle the situation, because they\u2019re so insistent [on ignoring him].\u201d\n\nPicture books are one type of book shared by adults and children. A few adults didn\u2019t like it \u2013 it made them feel guilty David McKee\n\nMcKee, who also wrote and illustrated the childhood classics Elmer the Patchwork Elephant and Mr Benn, reveals he came up with the idea for Not Now, Bernard while having a bath. \u201cThe phrase went through my mind and I just lay there with my skin all wrinkling, as it does, and listened to the story being told to me, in my head.\u201d\n\nHe is aware that some children see the monster as \u201cBernard, really\u201d, while others think it is a separate being who behaves a bit like Bernard when he\u2019s naughty. The story can be read either way, he says \u2013 but he does think there is an angry monster inside all of us. \u201cIf we are ignored or badly treated, there\u2019s something inside of us that starts to rise up and we react. And that\u2019s something we have to control, and it\u2019s not always easy. Bernard realises he\u2019s going to be eaten by a monster \u2013 and he is.\u201d\n\nThe book also highlights how children feel when they are provided with material things, like toys and food, but not love and attention: \u201cPicture books are the one type of book which is shared by adults and children. I\u2019ve seen a few adults who didn\u2019t like it, because it made them feel guilty.\u201d\n\nBut he has also noticed that children today say \u201cnot now\u201d to their parents more often than they did 40 years ago, favouring the virtual world in their pocket to the one outside. \u201cIt is a world they are used to being in, I suppose.\u201d\n\nAs for himself, McKee doesn\u2019t own a smartphone, send emails or even wear a watch. Few locals who know him are aware that he is a famous children\u2019s author: \u201cI prefer to be just that silly old man who walks down the road.

Photograph: vorDa/Getty Images\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we know about Covid-19, it is that the pandemic is incredibly infectious. At the same time, the volume of disinformation from doctored photos to false rumours and hoax videos spreading online has grown at a worrying pace.\n\nIn etymological terms, the word \u201cviral\u201d comes from the stem word \u201cvirus\u201d. And the viral misinformation can be a danger in itself. Just think of the recent petrol bomb attacks on 5G phone masts because of a widely believed \u2013 but unfounded \u2013 link to coronavirus.\n\nThere\u2019s so much noise on social media that false theories are easily spread: whether that\u2019s forwarding an email attachment containing a computer virus without reading it properly, or sharing a faked photo because you\u2019re in a rush.\n\nWith a 2018 Leverhulme Trust study showing that 60% of Britons believe in conspiracy theories, the pandemic means that staying vigilant online is more important than ever ...\n\nMyth: Mobile phone masts cause coronavirus\n\nThe claim: \u201c5G mobile phone towers emit radiation that attacks the immune system, thus affecting those vulnerable to the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe truth: There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans, with international radiation experts reminding us that Covid-19 has spread in many countries that don\u2019t have the high-speed phone system, such as Iran. The cause of the disease is still unknown, but appears to have started in a Wuhan food market where wild animals were illegally traded.\n\nSee also: Other false claims about the causes of coronavirus, such\n\nas eating bat soup; a manmade bioweapon for population control; and fortune cookies.\n\nIf in doubt ... Don\u2019t trust information on social media if you don\u2019t know where it came from; one video claimed new \u00a320 notes show symbols of 5G towers, and dozens of phone masts have been vandalised, including one serving Birmingham\u2019s NHS Nightingale hospital. If a cause is confirmed, it\u2019ll appear in reports issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Rather than trusting celebrities or influencers, try Googling the information to see whether trusted sources such as reputable news organisations like the BBC or the Guardian have reported it.\n\nMyth: Gargling vinegary water can cure coronavirus\n\nThe claim: \u201cGargling water mixed with salt or vinegar can wipe out coronavirus.\u201d Or so a post shared many times on email and WhatsApp tells us, often accompanied with information that \u201cholding your breath for 10 seconds can prove there\u2019s no fibrosis in the lungs\u201d.\n\nThe truth: At present there is no cure or treatment for Covid-19.\n\nSee also: Bogus claims that coronavirus can be cured or prevented by: oregano oil, lemon juice, sunbathing, using vodka as hand sanitiser, or drinking bleach.\n\nIf in doubt ... Check the latest advice on the NHS website, the WHO website or the Q&A page on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nMyth: Soldiers on the streets of London\n\nThe claim: In March, a photo emerged on social media purporting to show troops clad in army fatigues walking around London\u2019s Clapham Junction. Many wrongly interpreted this as evidence that the military had been deployed to ensure people stayed home.\n\nThe truth: The \u201csoldiers\u201d were actually students at a nearby military preparation college and had nothing to do with Covid-19, something confirmed by the Ministry of Defence and the college.\n\nSee also: Other fabricated photos and videos, such as footage of a man in Wales wiping his hands on a public lift (actually filmed in Bangkok), or the picture of worshippers crowded outside a mosque (taken before lockdown, 23 March).\n\nIf in doubt: Remember that many doctored photos and videos, plus images with misleading captions, exist online. You can trace the possible source of the photo with a simple image search online.\n\nMyth: There are online stores selling face masks in bulk\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: Despite global demand for face masks, a quick online search reveals vendors apparently offering to sell protective gear in bulk.\n\nThe truth: Hundreds of bogus websites have been set up by criminals since the crisis began, many claiming to have face masks for sale. Police recently revealed British firms and individuals have lost more than \u00a31.86m to coronavirus-related fraud from bogus companies with no intention of selling masks.\n\nSee also: The websites recently caught selling fake hand sanitisers or unregistered coronavirus testing kits - another scam.\n\nIf in doubt ... Never purchase anything from an unverified website - check the padlock symbol in the address bar that indicates a secure connection and report any misleading websites, emails or text messages you think may be suspicious.\n\nMyth: The government will fine people who don\u2019t social distance\n\nThe claim: \u201cThe government has been sending texts alerting people that they\u2019ve been fined for ignoring social distancing measures during lockdown.\u201d For example, one text reads: \u201cYou have been out of your house three times today, you are in breach of government guidelines. Your \u00a330 fine will automatically be added to your bill.\u201d A link leads to a non-governmental website asking for bank details.\n\nThe truth: Hackers have spied an opportunity in the many people working from home, attempting to access their networks or steal login and password details. Up to 21 April, Action Fraud had received more than 1,000 coronavirus- related reports, with losses topping \u00a32.3m.\n\nSee also: Any email that asks you for personal information such as passwords or credit card details.\n\nIf in doubt ...

Photograph: Yuki Sugiura/Guardian; prop stylist: Anna Wilkins\n\nForget whether the dress was blue or white, or if there was room for Jack on that floating debris \u2013 the most heated debates of our generation revolve around food. Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream; rhyme it with \u201cgone\u201d; certainly not; and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)\n\nBut few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We\u2019re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor\u2019s decision is final.)\n\n1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as well\n\nWhile it\u2019s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.\n\n2 You have the right to feel smug\n\nUnlike kale, baked beans manage to be both healthy and fun to eat. No one ever groaned when they found out dinner was beans on toast, but like a saucy ninja, they\u2019re sneakily really good for you. A good source of fibre, they count as one of your five a day, can be enjoyed by vegans and veggies alike, and are low in fat. Plus, if you choose Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, which also contain 25% less salt, you can feel even more pleased with yourself.\n\n3 Acceptable toppings\n\nThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We\u2019ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.\n\n4 The cheese rules\n\nDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans\u2019 sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it\u2019s simply not the correct way \u2013 the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.\n\n5 No napkins, embrace the sauce\n\nDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else\u2019s.\n\nBeans three ways: a trio of recipes for your store cupboard staple Read more\n\n6 Set the beans free\n\nOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it\u2019s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there\u2019s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let\u2019s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.\n\n7 The right type of bread\n\nThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we\u2019ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn\u2019t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.\n\nInstead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we\u2019re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.\n\nEvery day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it\u2019s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we\u2019re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here\u2019s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.\n\nHave cyber happy hour with your friends\n\nThe shutters might be closed on the nation\u2019s pubs, but that hasn\u2019t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of cr\u00e8me de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there\u2019s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.\n\nOnline rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

Its live chat room might be the digi-equivalent of the crisp-packet-rustler down your local multiplex, but there\u2019s no better way to laugh, comment and discuss the intricacies of Joe Exotic\u2019s mullet en masse.\n\nOnline rendezvous: With many Hollywood films getting early digital releases, a number of stars are hosting interactive events.

A quick online search should throw up a willing tutor for whatever whimsy you have, whether it\u2019s cake decorating, choir practice or Colombian cookery. Meanwhile, InterPals, My Language Exchange and Italki pairs anybody eager to learn a language with a native speaker on Skype or FaceTime.\n\nOnline rendezvous: Over on Zoom, Cocktails After Dark features out-of-work bartenders teaching viewers how to make drinks (plus earning much-needed tips in the process).

Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York\u2019s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites. Wildlife fans can ogle webcams showing brown bears emerging from hibernation in Alaska\u2019s Katmai National Park, majestic pachyderms and other charismatic megafauna at South Africa\u2019s Tembe Elephant Park, or sea otters sploshing around at Monterey Bay Aquarium.\n\nOnline rendezvous: The Scandi trend for slow TV is seemingly tailor-made for these trapped-inside times. Fire up the three-hour-long Sailing to Tobago YouTube video on your laptop, fix quarantini-inspired rum cocktails and stream a destination-appropriate calypso/yacht rock playlist and you\u2019ll be gliding (imaginary) crystalline Caribbean waters in no time.\n\nTurn your living room into a live gig venue\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll find a way to deal with the ennui,\u201d declared Christine and the Queens recently. Her method was throwing herself into near-daily live performances from a Paris studio on Instagram. Other musicians have been livestreaming shows, too, such as Neil Young, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, Charli XCX and more. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization\u2019s #TogetherAtHome concert series has featured John Legend and Chris Martin.

If we consider how teachers deliver excellent classroom teaching practice in a physical space, how they prepare should not be approached any differently in an online environment.\n\nFlipped learning\n\n\u201cFlipped learning\u201d is a term used to describe how teachers can provide material for pupils to learn outside of the classroom. Although this is traditionally considered homework or coursework and typically completed without the teacher, increasingly this approach to enhance learning outside of the classroom has been set and completed online. During lockdown, teachers will be focusing on core curriculum content, meeting the needs of vulnerable pupils as well as enhancing student engagement, mixing between activities, types of assignments and differentiation techniques to support a range of pupils. One factor that must be considered for teachers who are working remotely, is how they can mix online teaching and learning with traditional methods that would be used in the physical classroom. A good tip for teachers working online, especially from home, is to have a simple whiteboard behind the camera and teach just as you would in a physical classroom space. Doing this over a sustained period of time will definitely present a new challenge, but it\u2019s possible with well-thought-out curriculum plans, and a simple range of equipment.\n\nBlended learning\n\nBlended learning, first developed in the 1960s, was a method of instruction using technology-mediated methods. With flipped learning being the norm during lockdown, what can teachers learn from other educators who are already working in blended learning environments \u2013 teachers working in virtual schools, or online tutors?\n\nIf we look towards Barak Rosenshine\u2019s 17 recommendations for effective teaching, these can quite easily be reapplied to online teaching, delivered through (at least) video conferencing. At the start of every lesson, review the last lesson with a simple retrieval exercise. This supports long-term retention, can easily be deployed with a simple quiz or competition and is a guaranteed way to get a lesson off to a flying start.\n\nWhen presenting new material, successful teachers teach by giving a series of short presentations using many examples. Teachers should also provide guided practice by modelling various techniques. Where teachers present too much material at once, this will confuse pupils. Working online without sufficient verbal and non-verbal cues, means it will be critical for teachers to regularly check student responses.\n\nOne way that teachers can do this is to ask a large number of questions. Feedback can be provided by giving prompts, modelling and guiding pupils as they develop independent practice and asking simple questions such as \u201cwho, where, why and how\u201d to help shape pupils\u2019 thinking. When teachers check frequently to see if all students are learning, this processes information into long-term memory, developing schematic concepts to support retention. Teaching remotely, whether using Microsoft Teams, Google Suite or other platforms, gives teachers a significant array of strategies to deploy at this interesting time.\n\nFinally, research recommends that teachers should try \u201cscaffold learning\u201d, helping pupils to problem-solve by thinking out loud and providing cognitive support. This can be achieved by completing the work alongside pupils; doing this online may require teachers to use \u201cbreakout spaces\u201d by waiting to provide individual feedback in live video conferencing lessons.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Teachers delivering lessons from home should have a simple whiteboard behind them and teach just as they would in a physical classroom. Photograph: Jovanmandic/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nFlexibility and personalisation\n\nEvery student should be treated as an individual online as all teachers would in a physical space, and with teachers working remotely, they will need to learn how to use technology as well as adapt content to meet individual needs. If you are meeting your pupils for the first time, I would recommend sending them a survey, asking them to complete simple questions so that you can elicit initial information about their interests, abilities and hopes. You can then start to plan which interventions you will use in your lesson planning and delivery.\n\nTo help support increased teacher workload, my key recommendation would be that if teachers are able to connect with the pupils online, it is important to allow students to engage in a weekly and monthly review of their learning to support long-term memory. Often this manifests itself when a pupil says: \u201cWe\u2019ve done this before!\u201d But effective teachers will remind pupils that this is a retrieval practice exercise to assist with long-term retention.\n\nSafeguarding and security\n\nIf you are joining a virtual school, then I would assume the various safeguarding procedures are already in place. However, if you now find yourself teaching pupils online for the first time, having never met them physically, you should double-check to ensure that your new school has considered data protection, child protection, internet security and the various online safeguarding procedures for teachers and pupils.\n\nHow to conduct a remote interview: seven tips for schools hiring teachers Read more\n\nWhen teaching from your own home environment, it is worth reflecting on your own safeguarding procedures. For example, if you have not yet physically reached your new school, have you received any induction, or has the designated safeguarding officer spoken with you about induction procedures? Of the students in your register, which have specific learning needs that require initial conversations with your special needs coordinator or associated form tutors? All these balances and checks would be done physically on entry to a new school; just because you are doing this remotely, doesn\u2019t mean that they should not happen.\n\nCreating a supportive, online environment\n\nWhat should teachers consider when meeting their pupils online? Many schools will assign home-learning tasks through software or an online curriculum portal, which parents can access. Other schools will have their teachers and pupils log on to a secure platform, to complete assignments, submit work and interact with the teacher through voice or text. Some schools will be offering live video lessons with pupils, teaching from the home environment or from their school classrooms.\n\nIf we look towards countries such as South Korea and Singapore, where teachers have an almost celebrity-like online presence, it\u2019s common to find them sharing videos, teaching lessons through YouTube or having millions of viewers on Instagram.\n\nIf you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.theguardian.com and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite", "author": ["Ross Morrison Mcgill"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/10/i-have-craved-a-slower-pace-of-life-and-want-to-make-it-permanent-mariella-frostrup", "published": "2020-05-10T05:00:16", "title": "I\u2019ve craved a slower pace of life \u2013 and want to make it permanent | Dear Mariella", "text": "The dilemma I know we\u2019re in the middle of a global pandemic with the economy knackered and the free world led by a man like Trump. I know our freedom has been temporarily taken away from us. But I\u2019m dreading the end of lockdown.\n\nFor years I\u2019ve craved a slower pace of life. Lockdown has allowed me to spend time with my family \u2013 and not on the relentless promise of success in my career. It has allowed me to play and learn with my child, rather than rush to drop-off or pick-up at wraparound care. It has allowed me to walk in woodland rather than standing on a crowded commuter train. In many ways it has been idyllic.\n\nYes, I know I\u2019m lucky to be able to work from home instead of being furloughed. Yes, I miss friends and family and meals out, and theatre and cinema and sport. But I\u2019m loving this pace of life and struggle to come to terms with going back to \u201cnormal\u201d. Should I use this break as a chance to re-evaluate my way of life?\n\nMariella replies The short answer? Yes! I\u2019m sure that plenty of us will look back at this momentary pause in normal proceedings and share your sense of regret for its passing.\n\nYes there is extreme hardship and a financial impact that few will escape but, for all that, these are definitely gentler days for many of us. Not just in terms of kindnesses and a reduction in the everyday frenzy of life, but beyond that, there is a slow dawning of appreciation of the things we\u2019ve failed to value highly enough. The proximity of those we love; the luxury of idling; the value to our lives of friends not in our immediate reach; the enriched quality of a kind of existence that is possible when we are not running our lives against a ticking clock. There is also the pleasure of supporting local enterprises that have proved so much more essential than the impersonal giants that, for all their market domination, just weren\u2019t there when we needed them.\n\nWe should make sure the same old rat race does not re-emerge\n\nFor old socialists like me, the best of that ideology seems to be experiencing a reawakening as more and more people realise that the way of life we\u2019ve been aspiring to pre-Covid hasn\u2019t produced a bounty of wellbeing. It says a lot about our old lifestyle that the \u201cwellness industry\u201d was booming, making big bucks by commercialising the very things many of us are now enjoying under lockdown. Maybe that goal of \u201cwellness\u201d, but without the trademark, should now be top of our list of good things to retain from this traumatic time. Would it not be a fitting fate for this insidious virus that\u2019s stolen so much from us, to rebrand it as a positive new \u201cism\u201d, symbolising the moment our world paused and we reconstructed our dreams of what a good life should be? When we are forced to battle our way back into business, would it not be possible to make sure the same old rat race does not re-emerge? To try to maintain the central compassionate glow of this Covid spring?\n\nMaking the most of the time left is starting to feel like an imperative and you are not alone in experiencing the tightening of a knot in your stomach at the prospect of the lockdown bubble bursting. The cooped-up chaos, endless rowing and inertia that most of us expected seems instead to have configured itself into a better sense of being. Kids, no matter how reluctantly, taking some responsibility for chores; adults with time to talk to each other, to walk and read and listen and even play cards of an evening! Our world definitely seems to improve when we relinquish the expectations we have come to embrace as normal ambitions, sustained by endless and relentless consumerism.\n\nNow may well be the moment to take note of the beneficial impact that simpler lifestyles have had on us and our planet and insist that, when the time comes for re-entry, we won\u2019t just step back on the treadmill. I know that with an economy in freefall and job losses at an all-time high it won\u2019t be hard to tempt us into re-embracing our bad consumerist habits, but does a less frenetic pace have to be a bad economic choice?\n\nWhat I am certain of is that it would be an even greater tragedy than the one that has just befallen us to learn nothing from the whole experience except how to be better prepared for a pandemic.\n\nWould we be \u201cliving the dream\u201d if, after losing so many of those we love, enduring terrible financial hardship and cataclysmic job losses, we turned around and went straight back to normal once the threat of the virus abated?\n\nIf I believed in God, I\u2019d consider Covid-19 a pretty strong message from him about the need for behavioural change. I\u2019d like to join with you in exhorting readers to celebrate how different and better a world not based on \u201cbusyness\u201d actually is \u2013 and could be. I\u2019d be tempted to call this new awakening Covidism, as a mark of respect to those who have died and a way of reminding ourselves that their deaths should not be in vain. It\u2019s given us pause for thought and if we\u2019ve learned nothing from it, we really are a lost cause.\n\nIf you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.

Lavishly buttered or glistening with olive oil, of course, but oh so much more than that. Toast tucked under a pile of pak choi or spinach that you have saut\u00e9ed with olive oil, lemon juice, dried chilli flakes and pepper. Toast to sneak under a mound of mushrooms fried in butter and thyme. And, using up the weekend roast, toast to cushion a sauce made with leftover chicken, browned onions, sage and cream. Best of all was a blue cheese sauce, properly made with bay-infused milk into which I folded steamed spinach and fat butter beans from a tin.\n\nToast has been a lockdown go-to partly for its ability to make a light dish more substantial. The trusty crust that sits under a piece of grilled lamb belly or roasted red peppers and soaks up their garlicky, herby juices. The thickly cut chewy bread that lends heft to a light lunch of taglierini, basil and crushed tomatoes, or acts as a delicious raft on which to sit a vast, wobbling spoonful of parmesan souffl\u00e9.\n\nThis is \u201cbought bread\u201d of course, not being able to get my hands on enough flour to knock up a loaf of my own. I managed to get a panettone, too \u2013 and thank goodness that this vanilla-scented cake has become available year-round. As good as the soft, fruit-flecked dough can be, I do prefer it toasted, especially when I have sandwiched two thin slices together with apricot jam or some skinny matchsticks of dark chocolate. As the cake toasts on the griddle, the filling melts and oozes from the edges. A jug of cream wouldn\u2019t go amiss, or even a scoop of lightly melting ice-cream.\n\nCreamed butter beans and spinach on toast\n\nEnough for 3\n\nonions 2, medium\n\nolive oil 2 tbsp\n\nbutter 30g\n\nspinach 200g\n\nmilk 500ml\n\nblack peppercorns 6\n\nbay leaves 2\n\nplain flour 45g\n\nblue cheese 100g, such as Shropshire Blue, Stichelton, etc\n\nbutter beans 1 x 400g tin\n\ntoast 6 slices\n\nFor the pickled onions:\n\nred onion \u00bd\n\nwhite wine vinegar 100ml\n\nwater 50ml\n\nblack peppercorns 8\n\nsalt 1 tsp\n\ncaster sugar 1 tsp\n\nStart with the pickled onion. Peel and thinly slice the red onion and put it in a non-reactive saucepan with the vinegar, water, whole peppercorns, salt and sugar. Bring to the boil, check that the sugar has dissolved, then remove from the heat and set aside. Over the next half hour or so, the onion will become softer and less pungent, but retain a little of its original crispness.\n\nPeel and roughly chop the 2 onions, then put them into a deep saucepan with the olive oil and butter and place over a low to moderate heat. Let the onions cook, with the occasional stir, for a good 15-20 minutes until deep gold and translucent.\n\nWash the spinach and remove any tough stalks. Put the still-wet leaves into a saucepan, place over a high heat and cover tightly with a lid. Leave the spinach to cook for a couple of minutes in its own steam, turn once or twice with tongs, then remove from the heat when the leaves are deep green and wilted. Tip into a colander and rinse under cold water, then squeeze out most of the water with your hands.\n\nBring the milk, whole peppercorns and bay leaves to the boil in a small, deep saucepan, then set aside to infuse.\n\nStir the flour into the softened onions, continue cooking for a minute or two, then stir in the milk, a ladle at a time, discarding the aromatics as you go. Stir the sauce to remove any lumps, then leave to simmer over a low heat for 10 minutes, continuing to stir from time to time.\n\nCrumble the cheese into the sauce, taste, then add ground black pepper to taste. Rinse the butter beans and add them to the sauce, then stir in the spinach. Place the slices of toast on a baking sheet and set the oven grill to high. Divide the beans between the slices of toast, then leave under the grill until patchily golden. Top with red onion slices, lifted from the pickle, and eat immediately.\n\nChocolate panettone sandwich\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Keep it sweet: chocolate panettone sandwich.

Press the top half on firmly to keep the chocolate in place. Turning the sandwich on the griddle gets easier after the first attempt. I use two palette knives, one under the sandwich, the other holding the top in place. It takes a little practice.

Lower the sandwiches on to the surface and, keeping the heat low, leave to toast for a minute or two until the chocolate has melted. Watch carefully, as this really doesn\u2019t take very long.\n\nSlide a palette knife under the sandwich and, holding the top piece in place, quickly turn to lightly brown the other side.

He\u2019s now 22 months old and at this stage looks likely to be spending his second birthday in some form of quarantine or other. In a lot of ways, he got used to it quicker than we did, and we didn\u2019t take much longer after that. One of the strangest parts of this whole saga has been how quickly it all became normal, barring my incessant longing for a mediocre meal in a mid-price Italian restaurant, and the constant low-level worry that he\u2019s being starved of stimulus and will emerge from all this woefully behind all his friends because their mums and dads were actually good parents and had a nine-hour course of cultural delights planned each day.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that so many of the \u2018great ideas for young kids\u2019 you see online are so complex and labour intensive, and when we try them on him he seems resolutely uninterested and happy to continue doing his same old thing. We read to him, play games, do painting and building, speak to him all day in full sentences and try to keep screens to a minimum. We video-call his nana and grandad and make sure he has a little run-around in the park for half an hour every day. But we still fear it\u2019s not enough. That we\u2019re not enough, and he\u2019ll arrive at his first day back at playgroup saying \u2018nee naw\u2019 at his new fire engine, while all his playmates are tuning their violas and punning in Greek.\n\nMost of the time he\u2019s chipper about things, delighted to have us at close quarters and \u2013 we hope \u2013 too little to feel the constraints of being indoors pretty much all day. It\u2019s just that any time he\u2019s cranky or upset we feel guilty it might be because of his cloistered living arrangements, but that\u2019s not really verifiable. As much as we may ascribe his moods to boredom, emotional distress or the lack of peer interaction, I\u2019ve heard toddlers can be pretty temperamental at the best of times. We can\u2019t tell how those same moods would be if he had been in full-time nursery, or going on all the action-packed, educational trips to museums and galleries we presume he\u2019d now be taken on, despite never having been done so before.\n\n\u2018How sad,\u2019 we say, as he paws around behind the living room couch where all his toys are stacked, scrambling for something new to play with. \u2018If it weren\u2019t for lockdown, we\u2019d probably be on a guided tour of the Large Hadron Collider right now.\u2019\n\nThe harrowing truth of parenting is that, for the first time in my life, the things I do have a life-changing impact on another person. So it can\u2019t be having no effect, all this. It\u2019s just that the effects are unlikely to be those we predict, least of all the ones we fear the most due to our own insecurities. We have to have faith that a little bit of boredom won\u2019t be too detrimental in the long run. It\u2019s either that or viola lessons, and no one wants that.\n\nFollow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats", "author": ["S\u00e9amas O Reilly"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/10/how-to-save-in-lockdown-from-buying-chairs-and-laptops-to-car-insurance", "published": "2020-05-10T07:00:18", "title": "How to save in lockdown \u2026 from buying chairs and laptops to car insurance", "text": "We may be spending less by not travelling to work, but with an uncertain future it\u2019s time to take stock of personal finances\n\nWith gyms shut, taps turned off in pubs and the prospect of a holiday a distant dream, many people are finding their outgoings have dropped since lockdown. But the shadow of a looming recession and concern about whether jobs will even exist when offices reopen, means many are looking at their finances even more closely.\n\nSo what are the best ways to improve them amid extraordinary times and an uncertain future?\n\nEnergy prices\n\nNot travelling to the office brings some savings, but it is not all good news. Working at home could be pushing energy bills up 16.5% a month according to price comparison and switching service uSwitch.\n\nWholesale energy prices are decreasing, however, and this is being passed on to the consumer by some of the smaller providers. So it is worth shopping around.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge gap of \u00a3404 between the cheapest deal on the market and the price cap on the standard variable tariff,\u201d says uSwitch. \u201cThe gap hasn\u2019t been this wide since last summer.\u201d\n\nIt is always worth seeing if you can reduce your bill. But be sure to look at the unit price to ensure you are comparing like with like.\n\nCompanies are allowed to pay staff \u00a36 a week tax free if they are obliged to work from home, so find out if that is an option.\n\nWorking from home\n\nIf setting up a home office has meant buying new equipment, you can claim income tax relief for employment expenses, including broadband and heat. Fill out a P87 form if the expenses are less than \u00a32,500 for the year. For more than that, you will need to complete a self-assessment tax return. The relief is available if the expenses are \u201cwholly, exclusively and necessarily\u201d needed in performance of a job, so cannot be bought for personal use and claimed for later.\n\nMortgages\n\nLoss of income has led to over 1.6 million households applying to have mortgage payments and interest charges deferred for up to three months, but it is not a step to take lightly.\n\nWhile there have been assurances that taking a \u201cpayment holiday\u201d will not affect an individual\u2019s credit rating, there have been warnings that some may be turned away from future borrowing as they are effectively declaring they are in financial difficulty.\n\nYou must agree the \u201cmortgage holiday\u201d with your lender - otherwise payments which are stopped may be recorded as being late.\n\nTalk to your lender about extending the term, which will increase the overall sum paid but make it more manageable each month. And if you are not on a special deal, you can remortgage.\n\nSince the base rate cut, the number of mortgages has dropped by almost a half, according to Which?, but there are still some competitive rates to choose from.\n\nIf you are on a tracker mortgage or another type of variable rate deal, you should be seeing costs come down by about \u00a340 a month for every \u00a3100,000 borrowed.\n\nCar insurance\n\nWith quieter roads, insurers are reaping the benefits of fewer claims.\n\nSome are passing some of this on: Admiral was the first to offer partial refunds to drivers stuck at home, promising \u00a325 for each car and van it covered as of 20 April. LV= has also said it will return money, but this will not happen automatically, or for everyone. Contact the company if you think you qualify.\n\nDrivers who are doing substantially fewer miles may be able to get a partial refund by contacting their insurer. This could also be an option if a named driver is not using the car.\n\nThere is some early evidence that the impact of coronavirus may decrease premiums. \u201cAn unintended consequence has been fewer cars on the roads and fewer accidents, so it\u2019s fair to assume that this could result in reduced prices,\u201d says Dave Merrick from MoneySuperMarket. Drivers are advised to make sure their policy does not \u201cauto renew\u201d and they can get the benefit of shopping around.\n\nSavings and interest rates\n\nThis year is the end of a lost decade for savers, and recent events will leave them with little confidence that there will be any improvement in the near future. At the height of this emergency, the Bank of England cut interest rates twice in the space of a week, bringing them to the lowest level in its history.\n\nWhile it typically takes about three months for changes in the base rate to go through the market, there is already evidence that savings rates are being hit. The average easy-access rate - where you can withdraw your money at will - has fallen from 0.56% to 0.38% over the tumultuous period, according to financial data site Moneyfacts.\n\nThis may not be the end of the cuts so people would be wise to look at the best rates available now and switch. \u201cIn the months to come consumers may well rely on simple savings accounts to store any disposable income from lockdown, cash taken out of the stock market, or even pension freedoms cash,\u201d says Rachel Springall of Moneyfacts. \u201cIf this cash floods the savings market, providers could cut rates to deter investors - if they are awash with cash - or even pull accounts entirely to cope with demand. This means savers have to be quick off the mark to secure the best possible rates and keep a close eye on the changing market.\u201d\n\nLeaving money in the high street banks won\u2019t earn you much, so it is worth checking what the challenger banks can offer - for example, NatWest\u2019s easy-access rate is 0.01% compared to 1.20% from RCI Bank UK.\n\nSome people may consider a fixed one-year bond to guarantee them a return over the coming year but due to the uncertainties surrounding the economy once the coronavirus problem subsides, some will be reluctant to lock their money away.\n\nThe best rate for a one-year fixed-account is 1.65% with Bank of London and The Middle East, which also has the best two-year fix at 1.75%. FCMB Bank gives 1.75% on a three-year fix. All have a minimum investment of \u00a31,000.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Near-empty buses roll down Dundas Street and shush across the junction in the haar (fog). In this brave moot world \u2013 a month of Christmas mornings so far \u2013 I watch lone joggers and mothers with children, and wave at good dogs. I write to my friends. I check in by phone. \u201cYes,\u201d I say, several times a week, \u201cEdinburgh\u2019s very nice. Quiet.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, I spent several months travelling for a book, seeking out solitude and remote locations \u2013 strange to think now. I visited wild places on the edge \u2013 frozen Soviet ghost towns, Mars missions in the Utah desert, shrines perched high on Japanese mountains \u2013 as well as spartan structures whose wildness emanated from within, such as Simon Starling\u2019s metamorphic installation Shedboatshed, the writing \u201cWendy houses\u201d of Roald Dahl and Tove Jansson, and Roger Deakin\u2019s Suffolk shepherd\u2019s hut.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about these places a lot these days; about the way different people either embraced their outposts or, like Jack Kerouac, went to pieces. Kerouac spent his 63 days as a wildfire spotter crazed and lonely, beset by nightmares of yetis and bears \u2026 as well as by actual bears. There are fewer bears in Edinburgh but the cabin fever is still very real.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Mars Desert Research Station in a remote corner of the Utah desert, US. Photograph: Jurriaan Brobbel/Alamy\n\nHere we all are isolating inside, alone together. Parisian writer Sylvain Tesson makes the point in his marvellous book Consolations of the Forest when he\u2019s left alone for six months in a cabin in the middle of the Russian Taiga: \u201cIt\u2019s \u201327\u00b0 F. The truck has dissolved into the fog. Silence falls from the sky in little white shavings. To be alone is to hear silence \u2026 I will finally find out if I have an inner life.\u201d\n\nThe closest I came to such boondocks deprivation in my outpost travels was the days I spent helping renovate a bunkhouse in the middle of Iceland\u2019s interior tundra \u2013 plumb in the middle of nowhere. The hut, called Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes, was built in 1930 and sits on the shore of a frozen lake facing Iceland\u2019s second-largest glacier. Such cabins are called s\u00e6luh\u00fas in Iceland \u2013 houses of joy \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see why when one pictures the ancient Norse people sighting such a shelter after a long day\u2019s slog.\n\nOriginally built as way stations along ancient roads, they are used today by people exploring this country\u2019s uncanny beauty. Rebuilt and reimagined over the centuries, s\u00e6luh\u00fas now range in form from rudimentary rock-and-turf igloos to solid chalets with plumbing and stoves.\n\nI travelled to Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes with two carpenters, Stef\u00e1n and Atli, to fix up the building for future hikers. As we drove towards the glacier\u2019s huge white maw, the s\u00e6luh\u00fas emerged from the grass and marsh: red roof, green gables, white sides banked with turf. A little cabin sitting up, hugging its knees. \u201cSo, you know this place we are going is a very haunted house,\u201d Stef\u00e1n announced. \u201cOh yes?\u201d I replied. Atli met my eye in the rearview mirror. \u201cOh yes!\u201d he said. \u201cOh yes.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes is one of the most haunted buildings in Iceland. A title for which there\u2019s a lot of competition\u2019. Photograph: Dan Richards\n\nIt turned out Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes is one of the most haunted buildings in Iceland \u2013 a title for which there\u2019s a lot of competition in a country steeped in fantastic tales and the supernatural. I was furnished with copious tales of spectral encounters \u2013 ghostly women haunting sleepers in the \u201cbad bed\u201d, doors slamming, heavy footsteps in the attic; or walkers approaching a well-lit cabin full of life but opening the front door to find the inside freezing, dark and silent. Imagine walking all day and reaching, at dusk, the only man-made structure on a vast permafrosted plateau to find your bothy beset by poltergeists. It would be\u2026 upsetting.\n\nBut there was no sign of malevolence for the first week, and work to replace rotten planking and posts went well. In 24-hour daylight we hammered and dug, wrapped up against the wind, tiny figures in a leopard-print prairie. And we all slept well in our cosy cots \u2026 Until the time Stef\u00e1n had \u201ca long night with the ghost\u201d \u2013 an Inception-style series of dreams within dreams, none of them good. \u201cI\u2019m part-troll so I can deal with it,\u201d he told me next morning with a wry smile, but he looked knackered, like a man who\u2019d fought his way out of a supernatural tumble dryer.\n\nIf ever I awake after bad dreams now, I think of Stef\u00e1n\u2019s matter-of-fact \u201cI\u2019m part troll\u201d mantra, because I think it\u2019s true that being at peace with oneself is important for any traveller who wishes to explore the unknown. So often wild places reveal us to ourselves \u2013 how we are, whether we\u2019re happy in our own skin. If only Kerouac had possessed Stef\u00e1n\u2019s stoicism, faced with the great beyond. So often, to paraphrase early conservationist John Muir, going out is really going in. In these locked-down times, many may be longing for company, noise and bustle, but solitude still enthrals me; just as much as wilderness, I think it\u2019s a great teacher.\n\n\u2022 Dan Richards is author of Outpost: A Journey to the Wild Ends of the Earth (Canongate, \u00a39.99)", "author": ["Dan Richards"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/how-are-you-marking-the-75th-anniversary-of-ve-day-in-lockdown", "published": "2020-05-08T10:09:17", "title": "How are you marking the 75th anniversary of VE Day in lockdown?", "text": "We\u2019d like to hear from people about how you\u2019re remembering the anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe\n\nHow are you marking the 75th anniversary of VE Day in lockdown?\n\nFriday 8 May will mark 75 years since the end of the Second World War in Europe.

David Clark, the young Labour MP for Colne Valley, in which the former mill town of Marsden sits, had lost his seat. Clark gamely attempted to lift his activists\u2019 spirits with a rousing speech. But one elderly stalwart remained unmoved: \u201cOld Harry was sitting at the bar nursing a pint,\u201d recalls Clark, who is now 80 and a Labour peer. \u201cHe said: \u2018All due respect to master Dave, but we\u2019ve only ever had one true socialist MP around here. And that was Victor Grayson.\u2019\u201d\n\nClark had heard this name many times before, always pronounced with a special reverence and a wistful sense of what might have been. With more time on his hands, he began to look into the story of the predecessor who inspired so much affection and emotion. What he discovered, and recorded in a recently updated biography, remains one of the most remarkable stories in the history of British politics and one of its biggest unsolved mysteries. For a brief period at the start of the last century, while still in his twenties, Victor Grayson became the most famous socialist in England and a potential Labour leader. Then, 100 years ago this September, he vanished without trace. As Clark puts it: \u201cOne day in 1920, he walked out of his apartment accompanied by two men and was never conclusively seen again. What happened has fascinated me for half a century.\u201d\n\nPrecocious radicalism\n\n\n\n\n\nGrayson made his name in the Colne Valley by-election of 1907. At the age of 26, fresh out of theological college in Manchester, he became the first avowedly socialist candidate to win a seat in parliament. It was a sensational victory. The Labour party, seven years old and led by Keir Hardie, had made its first major breakthroughs at the previous year\u2019s general election. But this had been achieved through becoming, in effect, a junior partner to the Liberals, who stood aside in selected constituencies. Feeling their way, Labour\u2019s first great leaders \u2013 Hardie, Philip Snowden and Ramsay MacDonald \u2013 were sticking to a mild programme of incremental reform to working conditions. Grayson\u2019s precocious radicalism flamed across this horizon like a red comet. Colne Valley constituency, a mill-owners\u2019 fiefdom, was a Liberal bastion that was believed to be unconquerable. Ignoring the reservations of the Labour leadership, Grayson took on the local political establishment, advocating revolutionary socialism and female suffrage. In his manifesto, he told the textile workers of the valley: \u201cI do not believe that we are divinely destined to be drudges \u2026 the time for our emancipation has come.\u201d Unbelievably, he won.\n\nColne Valley by-election poster, 1907.\n\nThe result was national news. On the evening of Grayson\u2019s victory, a special correspondent for the Daily Express wrote: \u201cThe Red Flag waves over Colne Valley today. The fever of Socialism has infected thousands of workers.\u201d But it was the manner and style of Grayson\u2019s campaign, as much as his politics, that made him, in the words of one of his supporters, \u201cthe darling of the socialist movement\u201d. Handsome, genial and eloquent, Grayson seemed to be blessed with every political gift. An Irish priest who followed Grayson\u2019s campaign wrote: \u201cNever have I seen people so moved; least of all these Yorkshire people, whose main interest I always thought to be \u2018t\u2019brass\u2019 \u2013 never have I seen crowds so swept by the Holy Spirit.\u201d\n\nThe evangelical zeal was supplemented with quicksilver repartee and jokes: \u201cAny great orator needs humour and warmth,\u201d says Clark. \u201cMuch of Grayson\u2019s style was about making people laugh. There was a famous occasion when he stopped halfway through a speech and said to the women in this working-class audience, \u2018Ladies, what do you think of my hair today?\u2019\u201d At dizzying pace, such playfulness could give way to withering denunciations. Grayson could be funny or he could be excoriating, as when telling one Yorkshire rally: \u201cWe count it not only unjust, but undignified, for able-bodied persons to eat luxurious food [and] wear extravagant clothes, live in many and princely houses, all produced by others who grovel on the margin of existence.\u201d\n\n\u2018Traitors to your class\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Jon Cruddas, the Labour MP for Dagenham and Rainham, Grayson was a shining light in an almost forgotten Labour tradition. \u201cHe was a kind of political preacher,\u201d says Cruddas. \u201cHe came from the pulpit tradition and embodied a radical humanism that staked everything on a moral critique of early-20th-century capitalism. There was nothing doctrinaire or pseudo-scientific about his socialism, in contrast to some of the Marxist currents around at the time. It was a battle about dignity and ethics. But, of course, it became very sad, what happened.\u201d\n\nThe sale of honours is a national scandal. It can be traced right down to 10 Downing Street and to a monocled dandy I know Victor Grayson\n\nGrayson was an inspirational figure, but he was also flawed and vulnerable. An adopted child, there were persistent rumours that he was the illegitimate son of an aristocrat, which may have fuelled an insecurity that led to a growing alcohol problem. In London, he acquired a reputation for fine living which raised eyebrows in the non-conformist Pennines communities that had elected him. In parliament, he picked unwise fights with Labour colleagues. Six months after entering the House of Commons, Grayson was ordered from the chamber by the speaker after repeatedly disrupting a debate on temperance to talk about the plight of the unemployed. At the third time of asking he finally left, telling fellow Labour MPs: \u201cI leave the House with pleasure. You are traitors to your class. You will not stand up for your class, you traitors.\u201d\n\nIt was the beginning of the end of a dazzling but short-lived parliamentary career. In the election of 1910, Grayson narrowly lost his seat in Colne Valley and his love of whisky was becoming a serious problem. He suffered nervous breakdowns. When, in 1914, he was found incapable of delivering a speech to a packed hall in Bradford, his loyal Yorkshire backers reluctantly cut their losses. As Clark writes in his biography: \u201cA link which had lasted for ten years was severed \u2013 broken with regrets, for the Colne Valley activists had expected much, perhaps too much, from Victor Grayson. He had \u2026 given them their finest hour [but] the pressure was too great; his love of the good things of life proved too distracting. The whisky which had acted as his stimulant became his master.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Victor Grayson addressing a meeting in Trafalgar Square in October 1909 in protest against Spain\u2019s execution of the anarchist Francisco Ferrer. Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images\n\nThe first world war led to a wider and more acrimonious parting of the ways with old allies. The vast majority of Grayson\u2019s radical supporters within Labour were passionately anti-war, although the party itself was split. Grayson, who had railed against Prussian militarism, backed the conflict, in which he would fight and be wounded. He became a poster boy of the government\u2019s recruitment campaign, addressing rallies throughout Britain, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. In newspapers, he wrote fulsome appreciations of the then first lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill. An army medical report recorded that he was drinking a bottle of whisky a day while at the front. As support for the war drew him into new circles of influence, he was making dangerous but lucrative liaisons with such unlikely bedfellows as the newspaper proprietor, fraudster and populist patriot Horatio Bottomley.\n\nBeaten up on the Strand\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1920, the year he disappeared, Grayson was living in London, occupying an expensive suite of rooms in Piccadilly. Although he wrote occasional pieces of journalism, the income they generated would hardly have financed such lavish accommodation. Instead, Clark believes, after the war the former MP had turned to some form of blackmail. The natural generosity of spirit and joie de vivre had turned into something darker. \u201cIn political terms, he\u2019d lost almost everything. He\u2019d alienated the unions by calling their MPs traitors and he\u2019d outraged the socialist left by backing the war. I think, when he came back, he must have calculated that the only way of maintaining his lifestyle was by exploiting the contacts he made with powerful establishment figures.\u201d\n\nOne of the regular visitors to Grayson\u2019s apartment was a colourful and corrupt Whitehall fixer named Maundy Gregory. A peacock figure given to ostentatious displays of wealth, Gregory was said by a contemporary to habitually carry round \u201ca wad of banknotes the size of a newly born baby\u2019s head\u201d. He had carved a postwar niche for himself illegally selling knighthoods, baronetcies and peerages on behalf of David Lloyd George\u2019s government. In a public meeting of the time, Grayson summoned up some of the old fire: \u201cThe sale of honours,\u201d he told his audience, \u201cis a national scandal. It can be traced right down to 10 Downing Street, and to a monocled dandy with offices in Whitehall. I know this man and one day I will name him.\u201d But Grayson never carried out the threat. \u201cHe was probably being paid, on the authority of Lloyd George, to shut his mouth,\u201d says Clark.\n\nIn mid-September 1920, Grayson was beaten up in the Strand. Then, at the end of the month, the young manageress of his apartment block, Hilda Porter, saw Grayson leave accompanied by two men with whom he had been in discussions all afternoon. Porter later said his last words were: \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch soon.\u201d\n\nWas he murdered? For decades, that was the common assumption. But Clark now believes that Grayson was paid off for good and told to adopt a new identity. \u201cRemember there was no television. It was possible even for well-known people to go unrecognised in a way that couldn\u2019t happen now. I think, in 1920, Victor had tired of his superstar status. He had been terribly affected by the recent death of his wife, Ruth. Lloyd George may have got fed up paying him and Grayson was presented with an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Victor Grayson leading the procession on the opening of Scapegoat Hill Socialist Club in 1908. Grayson\u2019s popularity resulted in local children being named after him.\n\nThe theory is supported by an intriguing piece of testimony from a former Colne Valley comrade. In the 1930s, a veteran of the famous by-election of 1907 claimed to have tracked Grayson down to a furniture shop in London, which he said he owned. Ernest Marklew had himself become the Colne Valley MP in 1935. Shortly before his death, he told a Labour colleague that, after Grayson confirmed his identity, he begged Marklew to say nothing, as he had left public life. The exact details of the encounter, Clark thinks, were changed to protect him.\n\nClark originally called his book about Grayson Labour\u2019s Lost Leader. But, in truth, he says, the mercurial hero of Colne Valley would not have been right for that role. \u201cThe Labour party had opted against the revolutionary road to socialism and they were working at what they had to do \u2013 become an official opposition and start to appeal to people who hadn\u2019t made the jump to socialist thinking. Gifted as he was, Grayson would not have had the temperament to deal with that.\u201d But there can be no doubt that, in the unforgiving hills of the Pennines, he achieved something remarkable. Cruddas believes there are lessons to learn from Grayson\u2019s astonishing ability to connect. \u201cThe modern left is in danger, at times, of looking soulless,\u201d he says. \u201cA mixture of doctrinaire edicts and liberal neutrality. The early Grayson came from a different, warmer tradition. His kind of radical humanism is exactly what the left needs today.\u201d\n\nSoon after the triumph of 1907, when Grayson was still at the height of his powers, a fellow socialist tried to capture the impact he was making. \u201cThe children in the Colne Valley learn to pronounce his name,\u201d wrote Wilfred Thompson in an early biography, \u201calmost before they begin to say \u2018Father\u2019. Some are christened after him. It is a very common thing to see them sitting upon the edge of the platform at his meetings, almost before they can walk. Every Colne Valley child knows \u2018Vitter Gayson\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe memories were to remain long after the man had gone.", "author": ["Julian Coman"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/move-1985-bombing-reconciliation-philadelphia", "published": "2020-05-10T08:00:20", "title": "The day police bombed a city street: can scars of 1985 Move atrocity be healed?", "text": "Frank Powell, a Philadelphia police officer who in 1985 was chief of the city\u2019s bomb disposal squad, remembers vividly the moment he was given his instructions. \u201cWow,\u201d he recalls thinking. \u201cYou want me to do that?\u201d\n\nOn 13 May 1985 Powell was handed an army-style green satchel containing a bomb made of C-4 plastic explosives of the sort widely deployed in Vietnam. He boarded a state police helicopter, and took up his position balanced precariously on the skids of the aircraft.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember being scared,\u201d he told the Guardian, \u201cthough I must have been.\u201d\n\nAt 5.27pm as the helicopter rose into a crystal-clear blue sky he carried out his orders. Flying over a largely African American residential neighborhood of west Philadelphia, he lined up his sights, lit the 45-second fuse with a military igniter and followed his orders.\n\n\u201cI reached out and I dropped it. Perfect. It was going right where it was supposed to go.\u201d\n\nIt was to lead to one of the great, largely forgotten, outrages of modern America\n\nHis target was the roof of 6221 Osage Avenue, a row house which at the time had 13 American citizens inside. They were all members of Move, a group which combined the black liberation struggle with back-to-nature environmentalism.\n\nEach Move member took the last name Africa to signal their commitment to race equality as well as to each other as a family. For years they had been in a running battle with the Philadelphia authorities culminating that May in arrest warrants, for a range of offenses including \u201cterroristic threats\u201d, \u201criot\u201d and \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d, being served and a standoff ensuing that ended with the dropping of Powell\u2019s bomb on to their house.\n\nIt led to one of the great, largely forgotten, outrages of modern America.\n\nAfter the bomb struck, a fire told hold and began to spread.

It was only the second time in US history that American civilians were attacked on domestic soil by aerial bombing, after the dropping of dynamite on to African American homes in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the bloody race riots of 1921.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A view of Osage Avenue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, following the police\u2019s bombing of Move.

Wilson Goode, the first black mayor of the city, who approved the 1985 attack though he claims to have been ignorant of key aspects of it, has said sorry on several occasions.\n\nBut there has never been a formal apology from the city. No one involved in conceiving and carrying out the assault has ever been prosecuted.\n\nIn an opinion article in the Guardian, Goode argues that it is now time for Philadelphia to follow his example and issue an official apology. Repeating his \u201cdeep and sincere\u201d regrets, he calls on other former and current officials to join him in saying sorry for \u201cindefensible\u201d acts that led to a \u201chorrific outcome\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter 35 years it would be helpful for the healing of all involved, especially the victims of this terrible event, if there was a formal apology by the city of Philadelphia. Many in the city still feel the pain of that day \u2013 I know I will always feel the pain.\u201d\n\nGoode\u2019s Guardian article is part of a wider two-year effort to bring opposing parties in the Osage Avenue bombing together in a process of \u201creconciliation\u201d. The discussions, reported here for the first time, began in September 2018 and are ongoing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mayor Wilson Goode of Philadelphia, upper left, listens to the fire commissioner, William Richmond, at the special commission investigating the Move bombing and fire on 7 November 1985.

On the city side, they include Goode and Ed Rendell, who was Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney in 1985 and who served the arrest warrants that led to the bombing (he later went on to become governor of Pennsylvania).\n\nRendell did not respond to Guardian requests for comment. But he has approved a draft resolution of a city apology \u201cfor the decisions leading to the devastation that occurred on May 13th, 1985\u201d.\n\nOn the Move side, discussions have been led by Mike Africa Jr. He holds a special place in the Move family because he was born in a prison cell \u2013 his mother Debbie gave birth to him soon after she was arrested along with his father Mike Africa Sr in a previous police raid on a Move house in 1978.\n\nHis parents both served 40 years in prison for the shooting death of a police officer, James Ramp, during the raid, although they along with all of their fellow incarcerated Move members always protested their innocence.\n\nMike Africa Jr said that his many face-to-face meetings with Goode during the secret talks were \u201cthe hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do\u201d. His great uncle John Africa, the founder of Move, and his cousin Frank Africa both died in the 1985 fire.\n\n\u201cWilson Goode for me has always been the boogeyman,\u201d Mike Africa Jr said. \u201cAfter some meetings with him I came out literally vomiting. He\u2019s the face of the bomb that killed my family, the man who said after the bomb was dropped that if he had to, he would do it again. So to sit in a room with him, even decades later, was gut-wrenching.\u201d\n\nMike Africa Jr said he disliked the phrase \u201creconciliation\u201d, preferring \u201crestorative justice\u201d. The initial demand from Move was to have all the remaining seven members of the Move 9 who had been incarcerated after the 1978 siege released \u2013 an ambition fulfilled in February.\n\nNow Mike Africa wants to see the release of an associate of Move, the former Black Panther member Mumia Abu-Jamal who has been incarcerated since 1981 for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer. Africa also wants to see some form of reprimand for those who ordered and participated in the 1985 bombing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mourners of Move members killed in the bombing by the Philadelphia police raise their arms with the Black Power salute as the funeral procession for leader John Africa passes. Photograph: Bettmann Archive\n\nOther Move members are skeptical about the value of the talks. One of the doubters is Ramona Africa, who was the only adult to escape the Move house in May 1985 after Powell dropped the bomb.\n\nShe told the Guardian how she and 12 others cowered in the basement of Osage Avenue as the house came under blistering attack. Water cannons were unleashed, teargas pumped in, the front of the house blown off with explosives. Then more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition were fired from police submachine guns.\n\nAnd that was before the bomb was even dropped.\n\n\u201cWe were deluged with water and gas,\u201d Ramona Africa told the Guardian. \u201cWhen that didn\u2019t work to bring us out of the house, they dropped the bomb. The whole house shook.\u201d\n\nRamona was able to flee through a basement exit along with just one child, Birdie Africa. The other 11 adults and children tried to follow them out but were forced back under a hail of police gunfire, she said, though that account has been disputed over the years by Philadelphia police.\n\nRamona was badly burned in the fire. For her pains, she was arrested, charged with riot and conspiracy, and spent the next seven years behind bars \u2013 the only person ever to be convicted of crimes arising from the attack.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ramona Africa in 1996. Photograph: Tim Shaffer/AP\n\nGiven her devastating experiences, she is dubious about the prospects of reconciliation. \u201cWe don\u2019t want no apology,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t make up for what they did, they can\u2019t bring our people back who they murdered.\u201d\n\nJanine Africa, one of the Move 9 imprisoned after the 1978 siege, lost her 12-year-old son Little Phil in the bombing. She described the boy to the Guardian as \u201ca very outgoing kid, very adventurous, a little comic\u201d.\n\nJanine bitterly remembers how she learned that her child had diedwhile she was being held in solitary confinement (she was released almost exactly a year ago after 41 years in prison).\n\nShe recalled: \u201cThe guard opened my cell door and said: \u2018Your son is dead,\u2019 then shut the door. That was it. No explanation. Nothing.\u201d\n\nJanine Africa is also unconvinced by the push for an apology. \u201cIt\u2019s really insulting to say you\u2019re sorry now, after all these years,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite such reservations, Ulysses Slaughter, a reconciliation strategist who has mediated the talks, is certain the process is needed to heal the wounds that are still open for so many Philadelphians. \u201cThe events of 1985 continue to silently traumatize people,\u201d he said.\n\nFive kids died, and the neighbors lost everything. We failed, and it bothers me. Nobody ever seemed to care.\n\n\u201cPeople need to ask themselves, what have we become as human beings when we allow our neighborhoods to become war zones.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the more than 500 police officers who took part on the siege on 13 May 1985, as well as firefighters, have also been involved in the reconciliation talks.\n\nJim Berghaier was on police duty in Osage Avenue that day and helped Birdie Africa escape the conflagration. He told the Guardian that he is haunted by the image of the boy walking through a wall of fire.\n\n\u201cFive kids died, and the neighbors lost everything. We failed, and it bothers me. Nobody ever seemed to care.\u201d\n\nBerghaier said he only found out later that children had been present in the house. \u201cEven to this day I carry a lot of guilt because of those five kids. I was only a wall away from them. People say to me, \u2018But you didn\u2019t know,\u2019 but you can\u2019t help thinking about it. They died a horrible death.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Move members\u2019 children chant slogans at the start of a news conference in Philadelphia on 12 May 2010. Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP\n\nLinn Washington, who reported the events for the Philadelphia Daily News, believes it is long overdue for a formal recognition by the city of the grievous wrong done that day. \u201cYou can\u2019t effectively move on until you find that kind of reconciliation. They killed five kids. The police commissioner called them \u2018combatants\u2019 \u2013 they were kids!\u201d\n\nJamie Gauthier, the city council member who represents the area of Osage Avenue today, is one of several current elected officials backing an apology. She told the Guardian: \u201cTo this day this represents one of the most heinous acts done by a city government against its own people \u2013 not just in Philadelphia, but in the entire country.\u201d\n\nParadoxically, the only person who the Guardian talked to who said they have not had to wrestle with trauma over the past 35 years is the man who dropped the bomb.\n\nFrank Powell is convinced the fire that killed 11 people and devastated the area was not caused by the explosives in his satchel, but by the Move residents who, in his narrative, set fire to their own home in a deluded desire for suicidal martyrdom.\n\n\u201cWhat we did that day has never bothered me,\u201d he said. \u201cI went up in that helicopter with the truest intentions of getting those people out unharmed. It didn\u2019t happen that way, but it wasn\u2019t our fault. I can live with that.\u201d", "author": ["Ed Pilkington"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/10/you-are-still-a-soldier-to-me-the-forgotten-african-hero-of-britains-colonial-army", "published": "2020-05-10T06:15:17", "title": "'You are still a soldier to me': The forgotten African hero of Britain's colonial army", "text": "Jaston Khosa was one of 600,000 men from African countries who fought for Britain. He was quietly buried on VE Day after a life of abject poverty\n\n'You are still a soldier to me': The forgotten African hero of Britain's colonial army\n\nIn a crowded, Zambian slum on VE Day, a family gathered to bury one of the last veterans of Britain\u2019s colonial army. Jaston Khosa of the Northern Rhodesia Regiment was laid to rest on the day the world commemorated the end of the war in which he fought.\n\nThe 95-year-old great-grandfather was among 600,000 Africans who fought for the British during World War Two, on battlefields across their own continent as well as Asia and the Middle East. Although their service has largely been forgotten, the mobilisation of this huge army from Britain\u2019s colonies triggered the largest single movement of African men overseas since the slave trade.\n\nIn a eulogy to her father, M\u2019tundu Khosa wrote: \u201cYoung man, you were a soldier. You are still a soldier to me. You have fought for your health till the last hour. My hero, always.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father died a proud soldier,\u201d she told The Guardian after the funeral. \u201cHe would always talk about his war experiences. He was a strong, beautiful man and a friend to everyone, regardless of who they were. We will always remember him and we will meet on the other side.\u201d\n\nFrom his home in Zambia\u2019s capital, Lusaka, Khosa enlisted and was sent to Somaliland in East Africa to rout Italian forces, which had formed the Axis alliance with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. But more than seven decades on from his wartime service, Khosa died in poverty, in a dilapidated house in a squalid shantytown.\n\nIn late 2018, Khosa was invited to meet Prince Harry at a veterans\u2019 event in Lusaka and spoke with the royal about his years fighting for Britain as well as his current state of destitution. At the time, he said he hoped that his meeting with the prince would raise awareness of the plight of Africa\u2019s war veterans.\n\n\u201cHe can try to report it to UK when he goes back and say that Mr Khosa, his house is not good,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a soldier of the British Empire.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prince Harry speaks with Jaston Khosa and other veterans at Burma Barracks in Lusaka, Zambia, in 2018 Photograph: Jack Losh\n\nBut the elderly veteran\u2019s fortunes did not change. His health deteriorated, and he died on Tuesday evening at home surrounded by his family.\n\nFearful of the coronavirus and unable to afford medical care, his family decided against taking him to hospital. So his diagnosis is not clear; relatives believe he succumbed to cancer or kidney problems.\n\nKhosa was a keen supporter of the yearly Poppy Appeal fundraising event and enjoyed regaling friends and family with wartime tales. But he remained critical of the derisory level of state support for veterans.\n\n\u201cHe was smart, he was always polite and he was never afraid to say how useless the government were,\u201d said Mike Reeve-Tucker, a member of the Royal Commonwealth Ex-Services League in Zambia. \u201cThey\u2019ve done bugger all for them.\u201d He added: \u201cAs long as I can remember Mr Khosa has laid the wreath at the annual Cenotaph Parade in Lusaka and was always smartly turned out. He was an amazing guy.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jaston Khosa never lost his fighting spirit. Photograph: Jack Losh\n\nKhosa never lost his fighting spirit and was known to berate his country\u2019s leader at Armistice Day events. \u201cWhenever he saw [the Zambian president] Lungu, he always had a real bloody go at him,\u201d reminisced Reeve-Tucker, a former lieutenant colonel in the British Army. At one parade, he added, Khosa and other former servicemen became so vocal that a Zambian veterans\u2019 representative had to intervene and give a stern reprimand: \u201cBoys, stop it \u2014 the war\u2019s over, okay.\u201d\n\nAlmost one and a half million African soldiers drawn from European colonies fought in the war. Britain\u2019s African troops also faced discrimination. Some men were forcibly recruited even though the official line was that enlistment would be voluntary. Others faced beatings and floggings. The number who died is unknown.\n\nAll of Britain\u2019s soldiers were paid an end-of-war bonus based on rank, length of service and colonial origins. Black Africans soldiers were paid up to three times less than their white counterparts.\n\nDespite systemic prejudice, many individual British officers feel a deep loyalty to African comrades and raise funds through regimental associations and the Royal Commonwealth Ex-Services League. In 2018, the British government also announced a \u00a312million package to help penniless veterans and war widows from Commonwealth nations.\n\nKhosa, like many others, never escaped poverty. After the war, he found work at a game reserve and as a mechanic. In old age, he had to farm to survive.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jaston Khosa \u2018was smart, always polite and never afraid to say how useless the government were\u2019.

Though their symptoms varied, all the accounts from these people who have recovered from coronavirus echo the same sentiment: recovery came at a price. Weeks after getting better, strangers and loved ones still scrabble to create distance, afraid of contagion.\n\nAt the time of writing, 5,984 Australians had recovered from the 6,875 confirmed cases. While the emerging consensus is that recovery induces, at least, short-term immunity, the World Health Organization urges caution, and researchers and health authorities are racing to determine how long this defence lasts.\n\nHere, six Australians talk about life after recovery.\n\nKieran Ryan, 32: \u2018I asked my friends if they\u2019d carry my coffin\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kieran Ryan running the LA marathon before contracting the coronavirus\n\nKeiran Ryan had just run a 42km marathon in Los Angeles and felt amazing. But a week after his return to Halls Gap in regional Victoria, Ryan was in bed, shaking himself to sleep. His suspicions were confirmed in a phone call from the state\u2019s Department of Health, which informed him his swab had returned positive.\n\nBreaking the news to his parents, a notable pause from his mother made him realise it would be a stress they\u2019d share. \u201cIt was the first time I ever thought of my mortality,\u201d he says. \u201cI definitely put a brave face on \u2013 and I know it\u2019s not the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nAt his worst mentally and physically, Ryan prepared end-of-life arrangements and organised a will to avoid burdening his parents. \u201cI called a group of friends and asked if they\u2019d carry my coffin,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018This thing people are so frightened of, this thing has the ability to kill me.\u2019\u201d\n\nLooking for relief, Ryan searched online for people recounting their experience of milder cases but what he found at the time was grim. \u201cIt would have felt amazing to turn on the TV and hear from someone I could associate with,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand it\u2019s horrific but it\u2019s important to give hope.\u201d\n\nFor Ryan, the toughest time came at night. When supportive friends and family slept, he was plagued by questions that began with \u201cwhat if\u201d. He relentlessly searched for signs of improvement and was overwhelmed by what he saw online. Recognising the damaging effect it was having on his mental health, he found himself switching off his phone.\n\nNow, three weeks after his recovery, Ryan still zigzags between anxiety and graciousness when he leaves the house.\n\n\u201cI have an irrational fear that someone would refuse to serve me or there would be an embarrassing moment where you\u2019re made to feel unwelcome,\u201d he says, adding that he already feels isolated after recovering alone on his property. \u201cI was almost walking around feeling like, what if someone knows?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kieran Ryan on his property in rural Victoria. He has recovered from Covid 19\n\nDespite the lingering dread, Ryan is most thankful for the check-ins from his friends and family: \u201cConnection is something you almost crave.

Leaving his bedroom for the first time in weeks, he smiled and waved at a gardening neighbour as he walked by \u2013 a gesture he says is out of character. She stared back blankly.\n\nAt the grocery store the other shoppers were, he says, \u201cin a different world to me \u2013 they were nervous, I was on a high\u201d. He felt \u201cuntouchable\u201d.\n\nFor Sweetser, who lives in a share house with his 18-year-old son and a roommate, isolating in his bedroom was easy enough. He plugged a throwaway kettle into his en suite, had an assortment of disinfectants on hand and kept himself entertained with streaming services. He worked sporadically as an engineer. At the height of his symptoms, he stayed in bed. After some concern about how he and his son would be fed, the problem was solved by Sikh Volunteers Australia who dropped off hot meals. Logistically, most things were there: except empathy.\n\n\u201cThere was no compassion for me or the fact I might die, just themselves,\u201d he says of his son and roommate, who entertained conspiracy theories about the virus.\n\nYou're made to feel like you've done something wrong David*\n\nEven after an honest conversation about their hostility, little changed, Sweetser recounts. \u201cIt felt biblical, I felt like a leper,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the hardest part \u2013 being ostracised in your own home.\u201d\n\nSweetser was cautious and managed to recover without infecting either housemate. But when his son left the air conditioning running for too long \u2013 a pet peeve of Sweetser \u2013 he jokingly threatened to touch the remote without a glove.\n\nAs a regular blood donor in the past, Sweetser has been hoping researchers will ask him to be a part of a trial or make a blood donation.\n\nInstead, the question he does get often is if he will write a science fiction book on a deadly virus, having already published a few e-books in the genre. His answer is firm no: \u201cIt\u2019s boring. I like an enemy you can see \u2026 I prefer something like robots.\u201d\n\nKaren Clements, 55: \u2018My immunity is now my superpower\u2019\n\nOn the first leg of her trip home from a holiday in the US, Karen Clements had just flown out of New York when the pilot announced that the city\u2019s airspace had gone into a rare shutdown.\n\nBy the time she boarded her third flight, Clements was riddled with anxiety. Airports were empty and passengers were scarce. Sharing a plane with cruise patrons, she worried about contracting the virus \u2013 unaware she already had it herself.\n\n\u201cThe stress was worse than my symptoms,\u201d says Clements, who had discounted her migraines and nausea as side-effects from travelling. \u201cI got home, my legs buckled, and I had a massive anxiety attack.\u201d\n\nAfter calling for an ambulance, paramedics arrived in protective suits and, though she no longer showed signs of the virus, a cautionary swab returned positive.\n\nWith the mild symptoms behind her, Clements grappled with disbelief. Even when her isolation time was up, she remained indoors for an extra two weeks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Karen Clements has been free of the virus for weeks but still feels the stigma when in public. Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian\n\n\u201cI just wanted to hibernate purely from the shock of knowing I had it,\u201d the 55-year-old life coach says.\n\nOnce her own shock settled, Clements was met with the shock \u2013 and fear \u2013 of others.\n\n\u201cI was not contagious but [my stepson] said he didn\u2019t even want me in his suburb,\u201d Clements says. \u201cThe fact I had it was like I\u2019d still got it.\u201d\n\nNow, five weeks after recovery, the Melbourne local does her grocery shopping without a mask or gloves, citing her likely immunity as her \u201csuperpower\u201d.\n\nOn one occasion, when a shopper asked her to take a step back, Clements assured her that she was among the safe few, having recovered.\n\n\u201cIf she could have shot up into the air, she would have,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stop telling them though \u2013 I like the shock value.\u201d\n\nCamille Valvo, 64: \u2018You start acting normal\u2019\n\nWhen Camille Valvo left her house for the first time after recovering from coronavirus she was feeling like a fugitive. In a matter of days, she lapsed in social distancing, handing a fallen coin to a stranger on the street.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t realise but you start acting normal,\u201d Valvo says. Recognising what she had done, Valvo walked back and apologised, assuring him it was OK because she was likely to be immune.\n\nAfter catching the virus from her daughter, a flight attendant, Valvo isolated at home with her husband: \u201cHe was asymptomatic but he could have had the virus. It\u2019s one of those things you won\u2019t know unless he gets a test.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Camille Valvo on holiday. She\u2019s is part of a Facebook group helping people deal with recovery from Covid-19\n\nHoping to connect with others experiencing moderate symptoms, Valvo joined \u201cSurvivor Corps\u201d, a private Facebook group where those recovering or recovered from Covid-19 could connect with each other and medical professionals.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t hearing about the mild cases enough,\u201d Valvo says. \u201cMaybe if they did they wouldn\u2019t be in freak-out mode.\u201d\n\nStill an active member of the Facebook group, and now recovered, Valvo is hoping to give this support back to others: \u201cWhen people post that they are on to \u2018day 44\u2019 [of recovering], I think, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m lucky.\u2019\u201d\n\nSydney couple, 38 and 41: \u2018A blessing and a curse\u2019\n\nAnna* and David* \u2013 and more than 40 others \u2013 caught the virus after attending a wedding in early March.

Bryan was house sitting an artist friend\u2019s dog in Reservoir when isolation was imposed. His friends have been trapped in Thailand by the restrictions, so Bryan has had to stay on, to care for the dog. \u201cI caught a glimpse of the familiar moon when I was wheeling the garbage out a few nights ago and passed back through the house to encourage the dog, Trent, to join me in the backyard. We were out there for over an hour \u2013 mesmerised by the moon ... I miss my grandparents and my mob back home at Cummeragunja. My mother works at the local Aboriginal medical clinic there and she told me how wonderful everyone has been in observing hygiene, social distancing and ensuring that contact with the outside world is kept to a minimum. Our elders are to us, what diamonds might be to a materialistic person \u2013 highly prized and precious, and so I was so grateful to hear what my mum had to say about how our mob are looking after themselves so as to look after our elders. The thought of hugging and holding my family right now literally makes me cry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBetty\n\nWhen I first started taking these portraits through windows and doorways, I thought it might just be a handful of friends I shot with.

At a time of increasing conformity and commercialised ideas of beauty, the girls she had in mind were free-spirited and wild-haired; making dens and hanging out in woods, messing about in rivers, smoking in parking lots, lost in languid afternoons, careless not only of the male gaze but any onlookers at all.\n\nKurland started out on her quest in New Haven\u2019s semi-industrial hinterland before travelling further afield over the next five years on a mazy road trip; if the girls were on the margins, then she would be too. She loosely choreographed the groups of teenagers that she found, but mostly invited the girls into a promising setting and let them do their thing. She took this photograph of four girls in an abandoned car in the millennium year, and called it Shipwrecked. The girls she chose invariably understood the idea of the pictures. \u201cI can always spot people,\u201d she has said. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, really one of my superpowers. I can always tell which teenage girls would love living in the woods with their friends.\u201d\n\nShe sees her work \u2013 collected in a book, Girl Pictures \u2013 in the tradition of American landscape photography of the 19th century, which put young frontiersmen into natural settings as a way of propagandising the idea of the west, and a vision of liberty. Her utopian scenes recreated that idealised political fantasy, and recast it for 21st-century women: courageous and vivid and sisterly.

I\u2019ve told the story to my son and daughter and Mother\u2019s Day is a good time to share it with a much wider audience.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, my husband and I adopted our son \u2013 who turns 13 this summer \u2013 from Pakistan. When I told him how I became his mother, I said I was having difficulty having a baby and I prayed to God for a little boy.\n\nLESLIE MARSHALL: ADOPTION FOUND ME, AND MY CHILDHOOD DREAM CAME TRUE\n\nI told my son how on our 11th wedding anniversary our phone rang and a woman at the Edhi Foundation in Pakistan said \u201cyour son was just born.\u201d We were overjoyed!\n\nMy husband and I flew from Los Angeles through Chicago and Manchester, England to get to Karachi, Pakistan on a 27-hour life-changing journey.\n\nYears later I explained to my son how he grew from a little seed in another woman\u2019s belly, and because she could not care for him (most likely due to lack of finances or illness) she chose to place him in a cradle at the foundation in the hope that the kind people there would find him a forever family.\n\nI told my dear son that he was destined to live despite weighing less than 4 pounds at birth, with no incubator available. I said he was destined to my son and I was destined to be his mother.\n\nWhen I first held that sweet little baby in my arms he opened his eyes, looked at me, smiled and stole my heart. At that moment he became my beloved son and I became his mother, forever.\n\nYears ago someone told me that when you adopt children, you don\u2019t find them; they find you. And that is exactly what happened.\n\nMy daughter came into the world in an entirely different way. In 2004 my husband and I lost a child. Our child had a condition called Canavan disease, similar to Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nBoth my husband and I are genetic carriers for Canavan disease. I carry the Ashkenazi Jewish mutation, while my husband carries the Turkish mutation \u2013 despite being of Indian ancestry.\n\nAlthough the chances of carriers like my husband I having a child with this disease are only 25 percent, we opted to go through a process called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This required in vitro fertilization (IVF)\n\nAs part of this process, the embryos are probed to make sure they don\u2019t have the always-fatal Canavan disease. Sadly, cycle after cycle, our embryos had Canavans.\n\nThis happened 100 percent of the time with 11 embryos. So in addition to the miscarriages I suffered and the death of a child, I lost an additional 11 children\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nI had some embryos free of Canavan disease frozen. After we had started the adoption process for our son, my doctor\u2019s office phoned and said that I had three of these embryos in the freezer and asked what I wanted to do with them.\n\n\u201cWhat are my choices?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cImplant or destroy,\u201d I was told.\n\nDestroy! Now, I am pro-choice, but it was not my choice to destroy my embryos. The doctor also told me these were not very strong or healthy embryos and the chances of my getting pregnant after being implanted with these were very slim.\n\nNevertheless, I opted to be implanted and about 10 days later the doctor\u2019s office called and told me the pregnancy test was positive.\n\nWhen she was old enough to understand, I told my daughter \u2013 who is now 12 \u2013 how she was created in a little dish and then placed inside my tummy and grew to become our wonderful child. I told her she was lucky No. 13.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd I told her how I almost drove off the road because I was crying so hard with tears of joy when the doctor\u2019s office called to tell me of my little girl.\n\nSo although my son came to me through adoption and my daughter through 13 IVF cycles, I tell them often that they are both my miracle babies. And it\u2019s true.

And as summer draws closer and most lockdowns have yet to be lifted, some may be feeling anxious that they\u2019re going to miss out on summer.\n\nFox News spoke with Dr. Tony Ortega, a licensed psychologist and the author of \"#IsHeHereYet: Being The Person You Want To Be With,\" about how to handle the fear of missing out (FOMO) on summer in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOrtega recommends thinking outside the box, and not letting life reflect the current situation. Doing what you can to take control of your own reality (while also taking the safety of others into consideration) can help fight the fear of missing out.\n\nECONOMIST SHARES HOPEFUL PREDICTION FOR DISNEY PARKS REOPENING\n\nOne of the first things people can do is reschedule events (when possible).\n\n\u201cSure, you want to celebrate an event on a certain date,\u201d Dr. Ortega explains. \u201cBut what's more important, the event itself or the date it falls on? Dates are just numbers. Events are so much more than that. Let go of needing an event to occur on a specific date and plan for the event of the century in the future.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, he said you shouldn't feel like you're disappointing people if you can\u2019t attend their events, as this is a situation none of us could ever have planned for.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nWhen possible, Ortega also advises celebrating summer events virtually.\n\n\"Just because Summer 2020 may be canceled, it doesn't mean your event has to be canceled as well. Sure, the way you go about it may look vastly different than what you had planned. We have seen amazing events conducted virtually. It's not the same, but it allows for the events to go on.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLastly, he recommended that it\u2019s OK to feel FOMO \u2014 just don't \u201cbeat yourself up about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe key is to allow yourself to feel the feeling and then choose a course of action that is in alignment with who you want to be regardless of external circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a philosophy you can carry with you in your life post-quarantine.\u201d", "author": ["Michael Hollan"]}, {"link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kathy-ireland-balancing-family-business-coronavirus", "published": "2020-05-10T09:00:55", "title": "Kathy Ireland shares working from home tips during the pandemic: 'Changing our expectations is helpful'", "text": "Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.

And it certainly gives you something to do every day!\u201d During these unprecedented times, the 71-year-old said it\u2019s crucial now more than ever to express your gratitude to mom. \u201cIt\u2019s hard living so far away from my daughter and this year the distance feels even farther away than usual,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s the simple things like a phone call, a card call, Zoom \u2013 anything\u2026 that will make this Mother\u2019s Day as pleasant as possible. Keep reaching out to your family and friends on a daily basis. Get in touch with a couple of people each day just to check in and say hi. The contact is important as we year for community and closeness.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY RELEASE NEW VIDEO OF ARCHIE FOR HIS FIRST BIRTHDAY\n\nKaren Grassle\n\nKaren Grassle, who starred as Caroline Ingalls on \u201cLittle House on the Prairie,\u201d suggested now is the perfect time to give your mom the gift of a fun lesson on technology. \u201cShow her how to use her phone or computer,\u201d said the actress. \u201cYou can also have a Zoom brunch with the whole family at a prearranged time. No dishes! If there are a number of members of the family, divide up the week and each one call one day each during the shelter in place, especially if she\u2019s in a retirement or nursing home.\u201d\n\nThe mother of one also shared that if teaching isn\u2019t your thing, another simple gesture can be just as loving on the matriarch\u2019s special day. \u201cAs yourself this: what would make her life smoother now? A run to the grocery store?\u201d For the star, motherhood has been her greatest role. \u201cIt has taught me what unconditional love it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful I didn\u2019t miss this wonderful to love and grow.

She\u2019s the best production I have ever starred in! Gabrielle is the center of everything in my life. She has taught me love, perseverance, understanding, patients and joy. She is my success.\u201d\n\nThe actress said that when it comes to showing mom how thankful you are, it\u2019s the thought that counts. \u201cThe great thing about energy is you can connect with it anywhere,\u201d she explained. \u201cSend her energetic hugs, love and messages of appreciation. Whether mom is still with you or has made her transition, your energy and connection will reach her energy. Always, always go back to the state of love: for mom, the Earth, your body, your thoughts.

The rule of law matters. It\u2019s a fact that President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, lied to the FBI \u2013 he pleaded guilty to the charge. And yet, Attorney General William Barr and his Justice Department effectively pardoned Flynn by filing a motion Thursday to dismiss charges against the retired Army lieutenant general.\n\nFlynn\u2019s guilty plea dealt with his communications with Sergey Kislyak, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., in late 2016 during the transition period after Trump was elected president but before he was inaugurated.\n\nBarr claimed he wants to end the prosecution of Flynn in order \u201cto restore confidence in the system\u201d and that he \u201cwas doing the law\u2019s bidding.\u201d In fact, that\u2019s exactly the opposite of what happened.\n\nDOJ DROPS CASE AGAINST MICHAEL FLYNN, IN WAKE OF INTERNAL MEMO RELEASE\n\nWhat Barr did \u2013 at President Trump\u2019s behest, in my opinion \u2013 was another in a long line of instances where we see blind loyalty to a president over the facts, and where the rule of Trump triumphed over the rule of law.\n\nThis is why, as I said in a Fox News interview on \u201cBill Hemmer Reports,\u201d the upcoming election in November has never been more important.\n\nSince Trump took office almost 1,200 days ago, the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker has calculated that the president has made more than 18,000 \u201cfalse or misleading claims.\u201d Trump\u2019s disregard for facts spans almost every issue, from health care, immigration, climate change, criminal justice and foreign policy to Russia (yes, of course, Russia) and the 2016 election.\n\nEven the coronavirus has yielded hundreds more falsehoods from Trump. During this deadly crisis, the president should be leading us with facts and empathy. Instead, Trump has touted fake miracle cures, claimed that \u201canybody that needs a test can have a test,\u201d blamed President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for leaving him with \u201cnothing,\u201d and said that the virus is \u201cgoing to disappear.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s false claims have directly endangered the lives of countless Americans.\n\nAnd how about Trump\u2019s disregard for the rule of law? We\u2019ll get to what his Justice Department has done to erode confidence in our laws, but Trump himself has personally and repeatedly attacked judges and judicial opinions with which he disagrees.\n\nWhen running for president in 2016, Trump responded to U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel\u2019s orders in a class-action case against Trump University by attacking the Indiana-born judge as biased because of his \u201cMexican heritage\u201d and appointment by a Democratic president.\n\nAlso during the presidential campaign, Trump called Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg an \u201cincompetent judge\u201d and called for her resignation.\n\nDuring his presidency, on both terrorism and immigration-related rulings, Trump has questioned judicial authority, claimed that judges are biased against him, called courts a \u201cjoke\" and a \"laughingstock,\u201d and even suggested that judges and the court system would be to blame for future terrorist attacks.\n\nIn November 2018, Trump even engaged in a Twitter spat with Chief Justice John Roberts over the independence of the judiciary.\n\nAnd in February, the president attacked U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson following the conviction of Trump crony Roger Stone for lying to Congress.\n\nSo it\u2019s abundantly clear that Trump only respects the rule of law when the rule and the law favor him.\n\nBut since we\u2019re focused on what amounts to Flynn\u2019s \u201cpardon,\u201d let\u2019s talk about how Barr \u2013 one of Trump\u2019s chief enablers \u2013 has also disregarded facts and the rule of law since becoming attorney general in February 2019.\n\nTrump\u2019s false claims have directly endangered the lives of countless Americans.\n\nIn March 2019, only a month after being appointed by Trump, Barr sent a \u201csummary\u201d of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report to Congress that grossly mischaracterized the report and, in the words of Mueller, sought to create \u201cpublic confusion\u201d and threatened \u201cto undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel.\u201d\n\nNext, in July 2019 the Justice Department abruptly ended an investigation into several campaign finance-related crimes allegedly committed by Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\nThen in February this year, Trump political appointees at the Justice Department overruled the sentencing recommendation of career prosecutors in the Roger Stone case and argued for a more lenient sentence.\n\nFinally, on Thursday we saw the motion to dismiss charges against Flynn signed only by Timothy O\u2019Shea, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. O\u2019Shea is also a Trump appointee and a former senior counselor to Barr.\n\nNotably, just as in the Stone case, the career prosecutor on the Flynn case formally withdrew before O\u2019Shea filed his motion. These withdrawals shouldn\u2019t surprise us one bit. Rank-and-file Justice Department attorneys, both current and former \u2013 including some with whom I have spoken \u2013 are dismayed by the dropping of charges against Flynn and by Barr\u2019s disregard for the rule of law.\n\nSadly for the American people, what these withdrawals demonstrate is that faith in our governmental institutions is eroding from inside and out.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear here, now is not the time, in the middle of a pandemic, to re-litigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, or the contacts by Flynn and other Trump associates and family members with Russia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe question of whether Trump and his cronies \u201ccolluded\u201d with Russia has become so politicized that the indisputable fact that Russia helped elect Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton has almost become lost in the blatant disregard for the rule of law that has come to represent the Trump administration.\n\nSo instead, let\u2019s focus on the future and what we can do. One of my heroes, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, said: \"Where you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy. Make it. Protect it. Pass it on.\"\n\nHere\u2019s the least that we \u2013 Republicans, Democrats, and independents \u2013 can do: Speak out for facts. Protect our rule of law.

Sign up here.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Three members of the White House coronavirus task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, another stark reminder that not even one of the nation\u2019s most secure buildings is immune from the virus.\n\nFauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leading member of the task force, has become nationally known for his simple and direct explanations to the public about the coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease it causes. Also quarantining are Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn.\n\nDR. FAUCI PLANS TO ATTEND SENATE HEARING TUESDAY AMID 'MODIFIED' CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE'\n\nFauci's institute said that he has tested negative for COVID-19 and will continue to be tested regularly. It added that he is considered at \u201crelatively low risk\u201d based on the degree of his exposure, and that he would be \u201ctaking appropriate precautions\" to mitigate the risk to personal contacts while still carrying out his duties. While he will stay at home and telework, Fauci will go to the White House if called and take every precaution, the institute said.\n\nRedfield will be \u201cteleworking for the next two weeks\" after it was determined he had a \u201clow risk exposure\" to a person at the White House, the CDC said in a statement Saturday evening. The statement said he felt fine and has no symptoms.\n\nJust a few hours earlier, the Food and Drug Administration confirmed that Hahn had come in contact with someone who tested positive and was in self-quarantine for the next two weeks. He tested negative for the virus.\n\nWHO IS DR. ANTHONY FAUCI?\n\nAll three men are scheduled to testify before a Senate committee on Tuesday. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the chairman of the panel, said the White House will allow Redfield and Hahn to testify by videoconference, a one-time exception to the administration's policies on hearing testimony. The statement was issued before Fauci's quarantine was announced.\n\nVice President Mike Pence's press secretary tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive for the virus this week. White House officials had confirmed Thursday that a member of the military serving as one of Trump\u2019s valets had tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide as spokeswoman Katie Miller, said he was \u201cnot worried\u201d about the virus spreading in the White House. Nonetheless, officials said they were stepping up safety protocols for the complex.\n\nMiller had been in recent contact with Pence but not with the president and had tested negative a day earlier. She is married to Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser. The White House had no immediate comment on whether Stephen Miller had been tested or if he was still working in the White House.\n\nWHO IS STEPHEN HAHN, FDA COMMISSIONER?\n\nThe CDC and FDA would not disclose the identity of the person who had tested positive and with whom the agency leaders had come in contact.\n\nRedfield sought to use the exposure as a teachable moment. The CDC statement said if he must go to the White House to fulfill any responsibilities as part of the coronavirus task force, he will follow CDC practices for critical infrastructure workers. Those guidelines call for Redfield and anyone working on the task force to have their temperature taken and screened for symptoms each day, wear a face covering, and distance themselves from others.\n\nTrump has resisted wearing a mask, and in a meeting with the nation\u2019s top military leaders Saturday evening, he did not wear a mask during the brief portion that reporters were allowed to view. The generals around Trump also did not wear a mask, but participants did sit a few feet away from each other.\n\nFDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo said Hahn tested negative for the virus after he learned of the contact. He wrote a note to staff on Friday to alert them.\n\nSix people who had been in contact with Miller were scheduled to fly with Pence on Friday to Des Moines, Iowa, on Air Force Two. They were removed from the flight just before it took off, according to a senior administration official.\n\nWHO IS DR. ROBERT REDFIELD?\n\nNone of those people was exhibiting symptoms, but all were asked to deplane so they could be tested \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Pence. All six later tested negative, the White House said.\n\nThe official said staff in the West Wing are tested regularly but much of Pence's staff \u2014 which works next door in the Executive Office Building \u2014 are tested less frequently. Katie Miller was not on the plane and had not been scheduled to be on the trip.\n\nPence, who is tested on a regular basis, was tested Friday. Miller tweeted she was \u201cdoing well\u201d and looked forward to getting back to work.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the administration was stepping up mitigation efforts already recommended by public health experts and taking other unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of the president. He said the White House was \u201cprobably the safest place that you can come,\u201d but the he was reviewing further steps to keep Trump and Pence safe.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe White House requires daily temperature checks of anyone who enters the White House complex and has encouraged social distancing among those working in the building. The administration has also directed regular deep cleaning of all work spaces. Anyone who comes in close proximity to the president and vice president is tested daily for COVID-19.\n\nTrump's valet's case marked the first known instance where a person who has come in close proximity to the president has tested positive since several people present at his private Florida club were diagnosed with COVID-19 in early March.\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller, Darlene Superville and Lauran Neergaard in Washington and Aamer Madhani in Chicago contributed to this report.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/global-coronavirus-infections-top-4-million-us-death-toll-passes-78000", "published": "2020-05-10T08:21:43", "title": "Global coronavirus infections top 4 million, US death toll passes 78,000", "text": "Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.

I\u2019ve told the story to my son and daughter and Mother\u2019s Day is a good time to share it with a much wider audience.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, my husband and I adopted our son \u2013 who turns 13 this summer \u2013 from Pakistan. When I told him how I became his mother, I said I was having difficulty having a baby and I prayed to God for a little boy.\n\nLESLIE MARSHALL: ADOPTION FOUND ME, AND MY CHILDHOOD DREAM CAME TRUE\n\nI told my son how on our 11th wedding anniversary our phone rang and a woman at the Edhi Foundation in Pakistan said \u201cyour son was just born.\u201d We were overjoyed!\n\nMy husband and I flew from Los Angeles through Chicago and Manchester, England to get to Karachi, Pakistan on a 27-hour life-changing journey.\n\nYears later I explained to my son how he grew from a little seed in another woman\u2019s belly, and because she could not care for him (most likely due to lack of finances or illness) she chose to place him in a cradle at the foundation in the hope that the kind people there would find him a forever family.\n\nI told my dear son that he was destined to live despite weighing less than 4 pounds at birth, with no incubator available. I said he was destined to my son and I was destined to be his mother.\n\nWhen I first held that sweet little baby in my arms he opened his eyes, looked at me, smiled and stole my heart. At that moment he became my beloved son and I became his mother, forever.\n\nYears ago someone told me that when you adopt children, you don\u2019t find them; they find you. And that is exactly what happened.\n\nMy daughter came into the world in an entirely different way. In 2004 my husband and I lost a child. Our child had a condition called Canavan disease, similar to Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nBoth my husband and I are genetic carriers for Canavan disease. I carry the Ashkenazi Jewish mutation, while my husband carries the Turkish mutation \u2013 despite being of Indian ancestry.\n\nAlthough the chances of carriers like my husband I having a child with this disease are only 25 percent, we opted to go through a process called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This required in vitro fertilization (IVF)\n\nAs part of this process, the embryos are probed to make sure they don\u2019t have the always-fatal Canavan disease. Sadly, cycle after cycle, our embryos had Canavans.\n\nThis happened 100 percent of the time with 11 embryos. So in addition to the miscarriages I suffered and the death of a child, I lost an additional 11 children\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nI had some embryos free of Canavan disease frozen. After we had started the adoption process for our son, my doctor\u2019s office phoned and said that I had three of these embryos in the freezer and asked what I wanted to do with them.\n\n\u201cWhat are my choices?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cImplant or destroy,\u201d I was told.\n\nDestroy! Now, I am pro-choice, but it was not my choice to destroy my embryos. The doctor also told me these were not very strong or healthy embryos and the chances of my getting pregnant after being implanted with these were very slim.\n\nNevertheless, I opted to be implanted and about 10 days later the doctor\u2019s office called and told me the pregnancy test was positive.\n\nWhen she was old enough to understand, I told my daughter \u2013 who is now 12 \u2013 how she was created in a little dish and then placed inside my tummy and grew to become our wonderful child. I told her she was lucky No. 13.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd I told her how I almost drove off the road because I was crying so hard with tears of joy when the doctor\u2019s office called to tell me of my little girl.\n\nSo although my son came to me through adoption and my daughter through 13 IVF cycles, I tell them often that they are both my miracle babies. And it\u2019s true.

The rule of law matters. It\u2019s a fact that President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, lied to the FBI \u2013 he pleaded guilty to the charge. And yet, Attorney General William Barr and his Justice Department effectively pardoned Flynn by filing a motion Thursday to dismiss charges against the retired Army lieutenant general.\n\nFlynn\u2019s guilty plea dealt with his communications with Sergey Kislyak, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., in late 2016 during the transition period after Trump was elected president but before he was inaugurated.\n\nBarr claimed he wants to end the prosecution of Flynn in order \u201cto restore confidence in the system\u201d and that he \u201cwas doing the law\u2019s bidding.\u201d In fact, that\u2019s exactly the opposite of what happened.\n\nDOJ DROPS CASE AGAINST MICHAEL FLYNN, IN WAKE OF INTERNAL MEMO RELEASE\n\nWhat Barr did \u2013 at President Trump\u2019s behest, in my opinion \u2013 was another in a long line of instances where we see blind loyalty to a president over the facts, and where the rule of Trump triumphed over the rule of law.\n\nThis is why, as I said in a Fox News interview on \u201cBill Hemmer Reports,\u201d the upcoming election in November has never been more important.\n\nSince Trump took office almost 1,200 days ago, the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker has calculated that the president has made more than 18,000 \u201cfalse or misleading claims.\u201d Trump\u2019s disregard for facts spans almost every issue, from health care, immigration, climate change, criminal justice and foreign policy to Russia (yes, of course, Russia) and the 2016 election.\n\nEven the coronavirus has yielded hundreds more falsehoods from Trump. During this deadly crisis, the president should be leading us with facts and empathy. Instead, Trump has touted fake miracle cures, claimed that \u201canybody that needs a test can have a test,\u201d blamed President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for leaving him with \u201cnothing,\u201d and said that the virus is \u201cgoing to disappear.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s false claims have directly endangered the lives of countless Americans.\n\nAnd how about Trump\u2019s disregard for the rule of law? We\u2019ll get to what his Justice Department has done to erode confidence in our laws, but Trump himself has personally and repeatedly attacked judges and judicial opinions with which he disagrees.\n\nWhen running for president in 2016, Trump responded to U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel\u2019s orders in a class-action case against Trump University by attacking the Indiana-born judge as biased because of his \u201cMexican heritage\u201d and appointment by a Democratic president.\n\nAlso during the presidential campaign, Trump called Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg an \u201cincompetent judge\u201d and called for her resignation.\n\nDuring his presidency, on both terrorism and immigration-related rulings, Trump has questioned judicial authority, claimed that judges are biased against him, called courts a \u201cjoke\" and a \"laughingstock,\u201d and even suggested that judges and the court system would be to blame for future terrorist attacks.\n\nIn November 2018, Trump even engaged in a Twitter spat with Chief Justice John Roberts over the independence of the judiciary.\n\nAnd in February, the president attacked U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson following the conviction of Trump crony Roger Stone for lying to Congress.\n\nSo it\u2019s abundantly clear that Trump only respects the rule of law when the rule and the law favor him.\n\nBut since we\u2019re focused on what amounts to Flynn\u2019s \u201cpardon,\u201d let\u2019s talk about how Barr \u2013 one of Trump\u2019s chief enablers \u2013 has also disregarded facts and the rule of law since becoming attorney general in February 2019.\n\nTrump\u2019s false claims have directly endangered the lives of countless Americans.\n\nIn March 2019, only a month after being appointed by Trump, Barr sent a \u201csummary\u201d of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report to Congress that grossly mischaracterized the report and, in the words of Mueller, sought to create \u201cpublic confusion\u201d and threatened \u201cto undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel.\u201d\n\nNext, in July 2019 the Justice Department abruptly ended an investigation into several campaign finance-related crimes allegedly committed by Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\nThen in February this year, Trump political appointees at the Justice Department overruled the sentencing recommendation of career prosecutors in the Roger Stone case and argued for a more lenient sentence.\n\nFinally, on Thursday we saw the motion to dismiss charges against Flynn signed only by Timothy O\u2019Shea, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. O\u2019Shea is also a Trump appointee and a former senior counselor to Barr.\n\nNotably, just as in the Stone case, the career prosecutor on the Flynn case formally withdrew before O\u2019Shea filed his motion. These withdrawals shouldn\u2019t surprise us one bit. Rank-and-file Justice Department attorneys, both current and former \u2013 including some with whom I have spoken \u2013 are dismayed by the dropping of charges against Flynn and by Barr\u2019s disregard for the rule of law.\n\nSadly for the American people, what these withdrawals demonstrate is that faith in our governmental institutions is eroding from inside and out.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear here, now is not the time, in the middle of a pandemic, to re-litigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, or the contacts by Flynn and other Trump associates and family members with Russia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe question of whether Trump and his cronies \u201ccolluded\u201d with Russia has become so politicized that the indisputable fact that Russia helped elect Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton has almost become lost in the blatant disregard for the rule of law that has come to represent the Trump administration.\n\nSo instead, let\u2019s focus on the future and what we can do. One of my heroes, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, said: \"Where you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy. Make it. Protect it. Pass it on.\"\n\nHere\u2019s the least that we \u2013 Republicans, Democrats, and independents \u2013 can do: Speak out for facts. Protect our rule of law.

Those newborn days weren't the only ones where I would find myself awake at night.\n\nAs my babies grew, I would wake up with restless toddlers, or a sick little boy, or a potty-training little girl.

And there is a God who wants to meet you right where you are.\n\nAnd so, a few years ago, I decided this: Every night, I would post a short prayer for women to read who are also awake in the middle of the night. Hundreds of moms would comment on these posts nightly.\n\nWe heard from women who were awake with their newborns, up with sick children, in the hospital waiting for test results, sleepless because of worry, enjoying the stillness of their houses while everyone else slept, monitoring fevers, changing wet sheets, waiting to hear from children traveling home, anxious about the next day, and going through so many other common motherhood experiences.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs this community grew, we needed a place just for these nightly gatherings.

We\u2019ve also written a collection of all-new prayers for our book, \"Midnight Mom Devotional: 365 Prayers to Put Your Momma Heart to Rest.\"\n\nThis Mother\u2019s Day, here are a few of those prayers to hold near to your heart or share with the moms in your life.\n\nTonight we pray for the momma who needs to know that her role as a momma is so very important. She needs to understand that as she raises the next generation, she is taking on a precious and important assignment from You. Lord, we know she is doing kingdom work, even when it seems as if she is taking care of ordinary tasks. Help her see motherhood as You do \u2013 as a sacred calling given by You. She might feel as though she is just going through the motions, but she is shaping eternity. Bless her tonight. We ask in Jesus\u2019s name. Amen.\n\nTonight we pray for the momma who feels as if she is climbing uphill. She feels as though this mountain has no top and she will never reach the summit. Motherhood is so much harder than she imagined. She loves her children, but the constant daily struggle to do everything is wearing on her heart and mind today. Lord, we pray for this momma. We ask that You would remind her that she is never alone. Let her know that we, a community of praying women all over the world, are praying for her tonight in her climb. Please remind her that You are with her every single step of this journey. Give her sweet sleep tonight as she rests and prepares for another day. We ask in Jesus\u2019s name. Amen.\n\nTonight we pray for the momma who is anxious about world events. It seems as if this world is spinning out of control. The news and social media present every issue imaginable to worry about. She can\u2019t ignore these issues because they are right there every day. She feels powerless to bring about any kind of real change in these events. Lord, the only way a momma can really change world history is by influencing the lives of her children. Show her that by raising these precious little ones, she is reaching into the future and saying it will be better because these little lives will have a positive impact on it. Bless her tonight in the greatest calling: that of motherhood. We ask in Jesus\u2019s name.

Sign up here.\n\nGoing to school is a core function of a civilized society. Yet, due to the coronavirus pandemic that spurred nationwide lockdowns in March, American schools closed their doors. Since then, most of our nation's 57 million children in grades K-12 have been isolated at home, cut off from face-to-face human contact, friends, sports, school activities and normal life.\n\nThis cruel and unusual punishment cannot continue indefinitely, especially since it's well-known that the coronavirus mostly affects the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions -- not children.\n\nSo though the main reason for justifying the mass closure of America's schools is to protect children, our kids are not a high-risk group. Does that warrant this radical upheaval to their lives? Does that warrant the impact on millions of parents nationwide who can't pay their bills and feed their families because they can't go to work with children at home?\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ: CORONAVIRUS AND NATIONAL PARKS \u2014 TIME TO OPEN THEM UP\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, 10 children in the U.S. between ages 0-14 have died from COVID-19 as of May 6. As tragic as that is, for comparison, 107 kids in the same age group have died this year from pneumonia and 85 from the flu. But we would never close schools for those deadly diseases.\n\nFor the 15-24 age bracket, 48 died in the U.S. from COVID-19 as of May 6, while 143 have died in the same age range of pneumonia and 41 from the flu. Similarly, our nation doesn't close down colleges and universities for those non-COVID cases.\n\nParents ought to remember that when school and/or government officials inevitably succumb to teachers unions laundry list of demands come September, which could result in continued school closures, subjecting millions of youth to more unhealthy isolation and subpar online learning.\n\nNo parent should accept this as \"the new normal.\" The data we have at this time simply doesn't warrant it. Of course, the pandemic is a fluid situation and things could change for better or worse in the coming months.\n\nSome have concerns that if kids go back to school they could transmit COVID-19 to teachers or other adults; however, it's simply a guessing game how transmissible it is between these populations. The speculation varies depending on who you ask. But we do know kids can be carriers and transmitters of influenza --another contagious virus that kills thousands each year -- and again, we don't close schools because of it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn a piece in The New York Times, Apoorva Mandavilli writes, \"Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the decision to reopen schools cannot be made based solely on trying to prevent transmission.\" Nuzzo said, \"I think we have to take a holistic view of the impact of school closures on kids and our families. I do worry at some point, the accumulated harms from the measures may exceed the harm to the kids from the virus.\"\n\nExactly. We can't let the cure be worse than the disease. And if parents don't speak up and demand that schools reopen this fall, that's likely what will happen -- regardless if a resurgence of the virus takes place or not.\n\nThe stark reality is that the coronavirus may be with us indefinitely, just like the seasonal flu, and we must adapt to it rather than canceling youth sports and revamping the entire U.S. education system.\n\nWhat schools should do is offer teachers and parents a choice. For parents who are afraid to send their children back to school, those students should stay home and either do homeschooling or continue with online learning.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSame with teachers. If any are fearful to return to school, they, too, should remain at home and teach online while the rest of the healthy population gets back together in the classroom.\n\nSound reasonable?

Sign up here.\n\nThe left's position on the nation's proper response to the coronavirus pandemic, though shrouded in the language of compassion, is incoherent and morally repugnant virtue signaling.\n\nSince this calamity began, many national Democratic leaders, the left-wing media and various never-Trumpers have been more interested in smearing President Donald Trump -- no change there -- than helping to solve the myriad problems caused by the coronavirus.\n\nThey wanted it both ways. President Trump was doing too much, and he wasn't doing enough. Before the outbreak, numerous Democrats were downplaying the virus and condemning Trump as a racist for his China and Europe travel bans.\n\nDR. KEVIN OLSEN: CORONAVIRUS FRONT LINES \u2013 HERE\u2019S HOW WE TRY TO COPE WITH THE HEARTBREAK\n\nLater they blamed Trump for not taking the virus seriously, when in fact, they were taking it less seriously than he was. But being a progressive means never having to say you're sorry -- and that yesterday's inconsistent positions are deemed wiped from our collective memory.\n\nFrom the beginning, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, along with their medical team, were conducting daily press briefings to inform an anxious nation about the virus and the federal and state governments' efforts to slow the spread, organizing the distribution of medical equipment to hotspots and pushing legislation to provide relief for individuals and businesses devastated by the outbreak.\n\nThe media used those briefings to humiliate Trump rather than illicit facts to inform viewers. For example, New York Magazine's Olivia Nuzzi asked Trump, \"If an American President loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died in the entirety of the Vietnam War, does he deserve to be reelected?\"\n\nEditorial after editorial excoriated Trump for every imaginable sin and certainly every death -- while exempting Democratic governors from any accountability for wildly disproportionate cases and deaths in their states. They view everything through a partisan prism, and no crisis is too severe to be exploited for political gain.\n\nTrump, they said, was only interested in manipulating the crisis to enhance his reelection efforts. He jumped the gun in expressing his hope to reopen our economy on Easter. He wasn't listening to the medical experts. He didn't care about Americans dying. He was practicing medicine without a license.\n\nUnfortunately for these critics, President Trump was deferring to the medical experts, who repeatedly denied that he was ignoring them.\n\nConsidering themselves the sole exemplars of compassion, progressives insist that their views are the only morally acceptable ones, that all who oppose them are immoral and that so long as they have \"good\" intentions, neither their motives nor their policies can be questioned -- even if they are inconsistent or cause major harm.\n\nDemocratic leaders get away with indefensible, one-dimensional thinking, free from scrutiny by an equally one-dimensional media. Their statements are often childishly shallow -- and yet no one challenges them.\n\nTake putative Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who tweeted Wednesday evening, \"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: No one is expendable. No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow.\"\n\nWhile this may strike unthinking people as a compassionate declaration, it is a cheap shot at Trump, other leaders trying to facilitate the reopening of our economy and Americans yearning to be free again -- and to return to work. Biden is simply expressing his party's position: You must choose between those at risk from the virus and reopening the economy. There are no competing interests to balance. Your concern for those unemployed, devastated, isolated, depressed and with other medical problems that are ignored because of the virus is illegitimate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhat's particularly offensive is Biden's reducing our concern for those financially devastated to a class-warfare soundbite (\"to add one more point to the Dow\") -- as if having a heart for the unemployed is promoting the rich. That doesn't even make sense, but it doesn't have to as long as it serves the narrative that Republicans are heartless.\n\nSimilarly, the never-Trump group The Lincoln Project produced an ad called \"Mourning in America\" in which Trump is blamed not just for the Americans who died because he \"ignored\" the virus but for the economic devastation it caused. That's convenient. These faux conservatives have absorbed the ideas and tactics of their progressive soulmates -- virtue signaling, the shameless advocacy of mutually contradictory positions and consuming hatred for Donald J. Trump.\n\nYou know that Trump haters from both sides of the aisle have lost any semblance of fairness when their biases compel them to direct their energies toward destroying Trump rather than seeking solutions for our common problems.\n\nWe should all be working together to reopen the economy while trying to prevent new flare-ups, which happens to be precisely what President Trump and his task force are doing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTalk is cheap, and finger-pointing is easy, but real-world problems sometimes don't lend themselves to easy fixes. There are no perfect solutions here -- there is no way to avoid death and financial destruction, only to mitigate both.\n\nI trust that reasonable people -- hopefully still a majority -- will demand accountability from their leaders but not hold them to impossible standards. While people often look to government during times of crisis, we must understand that there's only so much that government can do and sometimes it can also get in the way. It's time that state governments show a little faith in the American people and respect their prerogative to return to their lives while still exercising responsible behavior to protect themselves and their neighbors.

Some see the pandemic as an opportunity to make our election process more secure, but others see it as an opportunity for partisan political advantage.\n\nMany Democrats are calling for a national \u201call-mail election,\u201d ostensibly to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. But this is a dangerous move because it invites fraud and eliminates the ability for election oversight.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom took a big step to advance mail-in voting when he signed an executive order Friday that will send every registered voter in the nation\u2019s most populous state a mail-in ballot for the November election.\n\nNEWSOM ORDER SENDING MAIL-IN BALLOTS TO ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS SPARKS CONCERNS\n\n\u201cNo Californian should be forced to risk their health in order to exercise their right to vote,\u201d Newsom said, explaining why he decided to make his state the first in the nation to send mail-in ballots to all registered voters.\n\nHowever, Republicans have objected to the move for very good reasons and may challenge it in court.\n\nCalifornia Republican Party Chairman Jessica Millan Patterson said in a statement: \u201cTo mail out millions of ballots to voter rolls \u2026 proven to contain alarming errors throughout the state is not a task that these Democrats can adequately manage or safely execute.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee cites internal polling that backs up such concerns. According to the committee, its poll shows that 62 percent of Americans say there is fraud in U.S. elections and that fraud would concern them under the nationwide mail-in ballot system Democrats have proposed.\n\nThe committee also said its polling showed that Americans overwhelmingly approve of safeguards against voter fraud such as signature matching, voter identification, and a ballot receipt deadline of Election Day.\n\nThe national mail-in voting standard advocated by Democrats is nothing more than a ballot harvesting scheme. Ballot harvesting is when political \u201cvolunteers\u201d deliver and collect ballots for submission for processing and counting. Some jurisdictions have banned such practices because they at least give the appearance of ballot manipulation and at worst amount to fraud in practice.\n\nThe Republican National Committee polling shows that 67 percent of voters oppose ballot harvesting.\n\nIt makes sense that there be uniform standards in federal elections that ensure all Americans are treated equally and fairly when exercising their most valued right as citizens.\n\n\n\nIn federal elections, there should not be 50 different standards. There should be one. If it is good enough for New York it should be good enough for Florida and vice versa.\n\n\n\nUniform federal election law should include these provisions:\n\nID: A citizen 18 years or older should have to produce a valid photo ID from an approved federal or state agency to register and to vote. Photo IDs have become a necessity since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. You need one to enter a federal building, get on an aircraft, obtain government benefits and for other purposes.\n\nRegistration: An eligible citizen should be able to register to vote up to two weeks before a federal election by appearing in person at an authorized federal or state government office and making an application.\n\nVoting: An eligible voter should be able to appear at his or her designated polling place from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on the day of a federal election.\n\nEarly Voting: An eligible voter should be able to vote no earlier than two weeks before a federal election at his or her designated early voting location between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nAbsentee Voting: An eligible voter \u2013 upon the showing of good cause \u2013 should be entitled to vote by absentee ballot provided the voter petitions for an absentee ballot in person at the designated place no more than one month and no less than two weeks before a federal election.\n\nVoting Machines: Voting machines should be uniform in federal elections. A uniform standard should be established to ensure one voting machine for X number of registered voters at a polling place.\n\nVoting protocols: There should be uniform federal rules and protocols for voter IDs, registration, voting, poll watching, voting machines, eligibility, timing, locations, tallying, reporting, challenges, recounts, certifications, candidate eligibility and forms.\n\nIt is not fair or equitable for 50 states to have 50 different rules for federal elections.\n\nIf the federal government establishes fair, just and equitable federal voting standards it will force the states to follow suit. Although states will not be required to follow federal rules in state or local elections it would be costly and inefficient not to do so.\n\nFederal standards would only be required for any ballot that contains a federal office election.\n\n\n\nThe federal government has a paramount interest under the equal protection clause of the Constitution to ensure that all Americans are treated the same when exercising their most important and valued right as citizens \u2013 the right to vote.\n\n\n\nAs a result, the federal government has the affirmative duty to ensure that all aspects of voting in federal elections are uniform.

Sign up here.\n\nWhile many heroic doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are working long hours and risking their lives to treat COVID-19 patients, others have seen their workloads and hospital occupancy rates drop dramatically as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. This has created a financial crisis and endangered public health.\n\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, public health officials urged hospitals to suspend non-essential medical procedures. U.S. hospitals canceled tens of thousands of elective surgeries and other procedures, and urged patients to make use of telehealth.\n\nAmericans adapted quickly to this new reality. Doctor visits declined nearly 60 percent from March to April \u2013 a stunning amount, according to a new Commonwealth Fund study. Some of the largest drop-offs occurred in surgery and pediatric care. Telehealth visits increased slightly, but not enough to offset the overall drop in care.\n\nDR. KEVIN OLSEN: CORONAVIRUS FRONT LINES \u2013 HERE\u2019S HOW WE TRY TO COPE WITH THE HEARTBREAK\n\nWith no patients to treat, a number of hospitals are in dire financial straits as they see massive drops in their incomes. The American Hospital Association estimates hospitals are losing more than $50 billion per month due to the COVID-19 slowdown. That could force 100 hospitals to close within a year, according to a USA Today analysis.\n\nPhysicians are in a similar predicament. Only half of primary care physicians have enough cash on hand to survive another four weeks, according to a survey from the Primary Care Collective.\n\nCOVID-19 is expected to push up to 60,000 family medicine doctors out of their practices by June.\n\nAs revenues continue to decline by huge amounts, physicians have little choice but to sell their practices to hospitals, insurance companies, or private equity groups. Such consolidation could make it harder for patients to access care and would cause health care costs to increase further.\n\nThe good news for hospitals and medical professionals is that as states begin to relax their coronavirus lockdowns, hospitals are trying to return to normal. Earlier this month, 20 states green-lit the resumption of elective surgeries that had been postponed to preserve personal protective equipment and other resources for the response to COVID-19.\n\nPatients who stay away from the hospital and put off necessary care risk dying prematurely.\n\nBut even without government restrictions on elective surgeries, fear of the coronavirus may keep patients away from hospitals for some time. Nearly half of doctors believe patient visits will only return to pre-COVID-19 levels sometime between July and September.\n\nBy that point, patients and providers alike will have suffered real losses.\n\nPatients who stay away from the hospital and put off necessary care risk dying prematurely. Without people to treat, physician practices and hospitals are losing money. Many could soon shut down.\n\nThese are some of the unintended consequences of the pandemic. Our leaders must keep them in mind as they work to resurrect the economy in the weeks and months to come.\n\nFear of the coronavirus and confusion over stay-at-home orders have caused even the sickest patients to avoid hospitals. Emergency room visits are down 50 percent across New York City's Health and Hospitals System. Admissions for a certain type of heart attack fell nearly 40 percent in nine major hospitals across eight states in March.\n\nThe data suggest that even patients experiencing medical emergencies are staying home. Things have gotten so bad that the American Heart Association joined seven other medical groups to remind people to call 911 and go to the hospital if they fear they've had a heart attack or stroke.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nInterruptions of medical care are taking their toll on patients. Those awaiting hip replacements spend their days in pain, struggling to move. Some doctors have postponed surgeries aimed at addressing early-stage cancer. The longer these \"elective\" surgeries are postponed, the more people suffer.\n\nPatients in need of treatment aren't the only ones at risk. The COVID-19 lockdown could lead to 22 million canceled or delayed tests for five common cancers by June, according to a new report by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. This reduction in testing could lead to 80,000 missed cancer diagnoses.\n\nThe same report found that colonoscopies dropped 90 percent between February and April; mammograms dropped 87 percent. New visits for cancer patients declined nearly 40 percent over the same period, while cancellations and no-shows nearly doubled.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSuch widespread suspensions of medical care may not have been necessary. The pandemic has not hit our country evenly. While the New York City metropolitan area has been hit hard, many hospitals outside COVID-19 hotspots have been practically empty for the past few months.\n\nAfter months of lockdown, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a public health crisis in more ways than one. While it\u2019s critically important to focus our attention on the deadly pandemic, we have to keep hospitals, outpatient clinics and health care professionals financially solvent so they are there to provide treatment and preventive care for our other important medical needs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY SALLY PIPES", "author": ["Sally Pipes"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/HdWk0F5lwqY/mothers-day-sadness-carol-roth", "published": "2020-05-09T14:00:58", "title": "Carol Roth: Mother's Day comes with sadness for many.

This will be my 23rd Mother\u2019s Day without her, and while it gets easier, it is never easy.\n\nThe challenge of Mother\u2019s Day is compounded by surrogate mother loss.

While any of these circumstances can make this time of year less-than-pleasant, coupled with the extra stress that we have been enduring from dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, the somber feelings seem heightened right now.\n\nSpeaking of the pandemic stress, dealing with COVID-19 is impacting Mother\u2019s Day plans for many people, as well.

While we must do so as safely as possible, it\u2019s time to get America back to work. Our workers know it \u2013 and the numbers show it.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April, triggered by stay-at-home orders and unprecedented economic shutdowns across the nation. This wasn\u2019t unexpected. We all know why it happened.\n\nNonetheless, the left\u2019s reaction has been saturated with pure hypocrisy, complaining about the loss of jobs.\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT SURGED TO 14.7% IN APRIL, HIGHEST SINCE GREAT DEPRESSION, AS CORONAVIRUS TRIGGERED 20.5 MILLION JOB LOSSES\n\nKeep in mind that these same liberal media elites, along with their Democratic Party allies, have spent weeks attacking protesting workers, Republican governors and President Trump for wanting to reopen the U.S. economy in order to end the high unemployment caused by the pandemic.\n\nHow can you advocate keeping the economy shut down and simultaneously complain about the loss of jobs? How can you criticize as reckless Americans who, unable to feed their families, asked \u2013 demonstrated, picketed, marched and begged \u2013 for their right to work, and then bemoan the loss of their jobs?\n\nHow can you underplay the widespread economic hardship \u2013 claiming that the cure could never be worse than the disease \u2013 and then complain when it becomes increasingly obvious that the cure may well be worse than the disease?\n\nAs the smug New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo put it when asked to address the suffering of American workers, \u201cget your head around the \u2018we\u2019 concept; it's not all about you.\u201d He, of course, still has his job.\n\nBut President Trump\u2019s critics don\u2019t get to have it both ways. They can\u2019t advocate policies that will kill jobs and then criticize the job losses \u2013 at least they can\u2019t do so rationally. Either the jobs report is a sign that we need to start doing everything in our power to safely reopen the U.S. economy, or it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe Trump administration was always prepared for a temporary economic slump as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which is why the president has been busy \u2013 both independently and working with Congress \u2013 crafting and implementing bold fiscal initiatives since the start of this health crisis.\n\nThe White House spearheaded a historic $2.2 economic trillion relief package, which included direct payments to taxpayers and billions of dollars in loans for the private sector. But it did not do so for the sake of setting yet another economic record.\n\nThis legislation \u2013 along with everything else the president has done in recent weeks and months \u2013 was designed to mitigate the impact of the temporary economic plunge that he knew was coming and set us up for the comeback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fully expected. There\u2019s no surprise. Everybody knows this,\u201d the president said in a recent interview, adding that \u201cthose jobs will all be back\u201d as soon as America reopens for business.\n\nHe is right \u2013 and the April jobs report shows it. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, roughly 18 million \u2013 or 88 percent \u2013 of the 20.5 million people who lost their jobs in April have been temporarily laid off. That means their jobs are destined to return with our economic rebound. That\u2019s extremely encouraging and different from prior recessions, where the majority of job losses were permanent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nInvestors recognize this reality, which why the stock market continues to recover despite the surging unemployment rate. In fact the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the NASDAQ all closed up on Friday following the jobs numbers release.\n\nThe Dow was up an impressive 455 points, or about 2 percent. Keep in mind that the markets are forward-looking, reflecting where investors believe the economy is going, while the jobs numbers are by their nature backward-looking.\n\nInvestors realize that we went into this recession with strong economic fundamentals and those remain strong.

Unlike my own situation, every problem on the \u201ctube\u201d was resolved within 30 minutes, and none of the characters ever let me down.\n\nDANIEL HOFFMAN: ON MOTHER'S DAY, LET'S CELEBRATE THESE VIRTUES THAT MAKE OUR NATION STRONG\n\nFlorence Henderson was probably my favorite. She was best known as Carol Brady, the \u201clovely lady \u2026 who met this fellow\u201d on the iconic 1970s sitcom \u201cThe Brady Bunch.\u201d\n\nThe program wasn\u2019t much of a ratings hit during its initial run, but the show found its niche when it first aired in syndication in 1975. It\u2019s been on the air ever since. Many people know every episode by heart.\n\nSome of the show's success is undoubtedly due to Henderson\u2019s take on the role of family matriarch, which made Mrs. Brady one of the most famous TV moms in history.\n\n\u201cI portrayed Carol Brady as the mom I always wished I had,\u201d Henderson once shared, reflecting back on her own troubled upbringing.\n\n\u201cI wanted to portray Carol as a loving, fun, affectionate mother and it seemed to resonate with a lot of people who maybe had the same situation I did growing up.\u201d\n\nHenderson was talking about people like me.\n\nNot only did my mom die when I was in the fourth grade, but my dad struggled with alcoholism and left the family when I was only five.\n\nI desperately wanted a stable, idyllic family life -- something like what was found with the Bradys. And while I now know that the shows I watched as a boy romanticized family life, there\u2019s still something to be said about showing life as it could be \u2026 and maybe, to some point, as it should be.\n\nAfter all, who doesn\u2019t want to grow up in a home where mom and dad love each other? Where the kids know they can trust and depend on their parents to provide a sense of safety and draw good boundaries?\n\n\u201cLeave it to Beaver\u201d is often lampooned these days as a show that isn\u2019t just outdated \u2013 but also a series that exaggerated life during the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nWell, of course, it did. It was television!\n\nReality shows didn\u2019t come along for almost 50 years -- and we all know some of the \"reality\" in those shows is equally staged.\n\nJune Cleaver\u2019s sweetness reminded me of my own mom\u2019s tender heart. As my mother lay dying, she asked me to go buy and then plant chrysanthemums outside her window. They were her favorite flower.\n\nI did exactly as she told me.\n\nBy the time they grew and bloomed, my mom was gone, but every time I saw them \u2013 and see the flower \u2013 I think of her. I believe that was her plan from the beginning.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhat few people know is that Barbara Billingsley, who played the character, was actually widowed 6 months before the show debuted.\n\nHer real life was nothing like the Cleavers. She later said the role was a \u201chappy experience\u201d and \u201cvery timely\u201d as she processed her grief. It gave her hope that better days were coming.\n\nClair Huxtable on the \u201cCosby Show\u201d was played by Phylicia Rashad. Her character was a smart woman who loved her children and was also their advocate \u2013 but who understood a mom has to be willing to teach her children hard lessons.\n\nBill Cosby\u2019s horrific crimes have tarnished the legacy of the show, but in a recent interview, Rashad shared that a goal of the series was \u201cto show and demonstrate that people are much more alike than we could ever be different.\u201d\n\nRashad recalled the late Nelson Mandela telling her he used to watch each week from prison with the guards \u2013 and that the humor and diversity of the program softened them and drew them closer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the power of good intentions,\u201d she noted.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the power of a positive example.

But the crisis has also forced to the center serious conversions about issues that matter to the future of the country. Issues like: the dangerous rise of Chinese global dominance, the porousness of our domestic borders, America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, and government corruption and incompetence.\n\nOver the past two months, you may have asked yourself: Why weren\u2019t we talking about these things before? They\u2019re important. Good question.\n\nThere\u2019s a simple answer to that. We didn\u2019t have time to consider the fundamental health of America because we were busy talking about Russia. In Washington, Russia is all we talked about for three years. All normal business in the capital city came to a halt, as we embarked on a bizarre scavenger hunt in search of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spies.\n\nKT MCFARLAND: BARR RIGHT TO DROP FLYNN PROSECUTION \u2013 THOSE WHO FRAMED FLYNN MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE\n\nEven at the time, the whole thing seemed absurd. Now we know it was worse than absurd. This wasn\u2019t history\u2019s longest episode of mass hysteria. It was instead an elaborate and intentional hoax, staged by the most unscrupulous and power-mad political operatives this country has ever seen. Sound like an overstatement? How do we know that? Because they have admitted it.\n\nOn Thursday the House Intelligence Committee \u2013 chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. \u2013 finally released 57 transcripts of testimony delivered to the committee behind closed doors during the Russia investigation. What do the transcripts reveal? We\u2019re not going to ask you to trust us on this one, it\u2019s too important. Instead, we\u2019re going to quote from the transcripts directly:\n\nJim Clapper, President Barack Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence, said: \u201cI never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting or conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election.\u201d Compare that to his Twitter feed.\n\nFormer Obama administration U.N. ambassador Samantha Power was asked by the committee if she had any evidence of collusion with the Russians. She replied this way: \u201cI am not in possession of anything \u2013 I am not in possession and didn\u2019t read or absorb information that came out of the intelligence community.\u201d\n\nObama administration National Security Adviser Susan Rice said: \u201cI don\u2019t recall intelligence that I would consider evidence.\u201d Amazing.\n\nAnd here\u2019s former Obama administration Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Asked if she saw evidence of Russian collusion, Lynch replied: \u201cI do not recall that being briefed up to me.\u201d\n\nNotice Lynch\u2019s word choice here: \u201cI do not recall.\u201d For three years, our entire political system revolved around the hunt for Russian spies. We were told again and again in order to justify this that collusion was the greatest crime ever committed in American history.\n\nYet the attorney general, a close friend of President Barack Obama\u2019s, claims she \u201cdoes not recall\u201d if she ever received any evidence that any of it was true. If she\u2019d been Roger Stone when she said that, she would have been charged with perjury on the spot. We\u2019d be watching her sentencing right now.\n\nOf course, Lynch probably thought the transcript of those remarks would never be made public.\n\nThat was clearly Evelyn Farkas\u2019 assumption. Farkas is a former Defense Department official from the Obama administration. She became a fixture you may remember on cable television, as news outlets scrambled for puppets with legitimate-sounding resumes to push the Russia collusion narrative. Dumb people who would say anything. In those categories, Farkas delivered in spades. Here she was in March 2017 speaking on MSNBC:\n\n\u201cI was urging my former colleagues and frankly speaking the people on the Hill \u2013 it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people \u2013 get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration,\u201d Farkas said. \u201cBecause I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left. So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy that the Trump folks \u2013 if they found out how we knew what we knew about the Trump staff dealing with Russians \u2013 that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence.\u201d\n\nAnd Farkas added: \u201cSo I became very worried because not enough was coming out into the open and I knew there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia. That\u2019s why you have the leaking. People are worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have very good intelligence on Russia,\u201d Farkas claimed. \u201cWe knew what we knew.\u201d But she didn\u2019t know anything. Farkas was lying, as purely as a liar can lie. Once under oath behind closed doors, Farkas admitted that. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was all lies, literally all of it, even the core claims about hacking that formed the basis of the entire story and the investigation that followed.\n\nIn 2016, during the campaign, someone stole information from the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email server. It wound up online and embarrassed Hillary Clinton. Democrats quickly blamed the theft on Russian agents, and therefore Donald Trump, who was supposedly the pawn of the Russians.\n\nIn fact, there was never real evidence that that actually happened. The Democratic National Committee, as you may have read, never allowed federal investigators to inspect their email servers. That\u2019s odd behavior for people who claim to be the victims of foreign espionage.\n\nInstead, the party\u2019s servers were inspected by a third-party company called CrowdStrike.\n\nAdam Schiff\u2019s committee interviewed the president of CrowdStrike Services and CSO Shawn Henry. Schiff questioned Henry directly. He asked if Henry knew when the Russians had stolen the data from the DNC servers.\n\nHenry\u2019s reply, which we\u2019re seeing for the first time is this: \u201cAs it relates to the DNC, we have indicators that data was exfiltrated. We did not have concrete evidence.\u201d Later, Henry admitted he only had only \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d that the Russians were involved at all.\n\nAdam Schiff heard those words directly, he heard them from the one person who would know for certain. Schiff knew there was nothing substantial at the core of the Russian collusion story. At the very center, it was hollow, it was a sham. But Schiff never suggested this in public. Instead, he did the opposite. He spent years on television telling you it was totally real, shut up.\n\nHere are comments Schiff made on different occasions on several TV programs:\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s clear evidence on the issue of collusion and this adds to that body of evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s ample evidence of collusion in plain sight and that is true.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion. Pretty compelling evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there is significant evidence of collusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is ample evidence and indeed there is of collusion of people in the Trump campaign with the Russians.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of this is evidence of collusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is significant evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.\u201d\n\nIn case you weren\u2019t counting during that montage, Adam Schiff said \u201cevidence\u201d nine times in that clip. Every single time was a lie. If you were following this closely at the time, you might have suspected this. Schiff never produced any of this so-called evidence. He just asserted its existence.\n\nAfter a while, we noticed. We confronted Schiff about it when he came on this show. He never answered our question. Instead, he accused us of treason. Here is part of our exchange:\n\nCARLSON Look right into the camera and say, \"I know for a fact the government of Vladimir Putin was behind the hacks of John Podesta's email.\"\n\nSCHIFF: Absolutely, the government of Vladimir Putin was behind the hacks of our institution and the dumping of information \u2013\n\nCARLSON: Of John Podesta's e-mail.\n\nSCHIFF: Not only in the United States, but also in Europe \u2013\n\nCARLSON: OK, you're not \u2013 you know what? You're dodging.\n\nSCHIFF: And Tucker you are \u2013\n\nCARLSON: Look and say, \"I know they did John Podesta's e-mail.

The entire apparatus of official Washington has been exposed by these transcripts, as well as by the documents just released in the Michael Flynn case.\n\nIn November 2019, government attorney Brandon Van Grack defended the FBI\u2019s decision to interrogate Flynn at the White House with no lawyer.\n\nVan Grack said: \u201cThe FBI was engaged in a legitimate and significant investigation into whether individuals associated with the campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump were coordinating with the Russian government.\"\n\nIn that same filing, Van Grack wrote that Flynn\u2019s phone call with the Russian ambassador was of paramount importance. \u201cIt was imperative that the FBI determine whether and why such communications with the Russian ambassador had occurred,\u201d according to Van Grack.\n\nBoth of those statements from Van Grack, we now know conclusively, are lies. In its filing this week, the Justice Department revealed that in early January, the FBI had already known there was \u201cno derogatory information\u201d tying Michael Flynn to the Russian government.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nNor did they need to know whether Flynn had spoken with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. They knew he had. They were listening. They had a word-for-word transcript of the call.\n\nIn other words, Van Grack was lying in his filing. This is not only of importance to Donald Trump. This is important to every American, because things fall apart when high-level officials do things like this for political reasons. There\u2019s a reason nobody trusts the government anymore.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Democrats who you should blame for the corrosion of our public life.

They were willing abuse their power, break laws, sacrifice their integrity and crush innocent people in their quest to destroy the Trump presidency.\n\nTrump haters claim Attorney General William Barr concluded Thursday that charges against Flynn should be dropped because Barr is a stooge for the president. This accusation is absurd.\n\nIn fact, the unjust and baseless prosecution of Flynn has more in common with the show trials of dictatorships than it has with the American system of justice.\n\nThe real reason the Justice Department moved to drop Flynn\u2019s prosecution is that the department never had a case against Flynn in the first place. Internal documents that were never supposed to see the light of day and only recently became public make this crystal clear. And there is likely to be another trove of documents released in the near future.\n\nIn their entirety, these documents are likely to show a pattern of abuse of power and wrongdoing by senior officials of the FBI, Justice Department, intelligence community, and perhaps even very senior officials in President Barack Obama\u2019s White House.\n\nThe documents will add to the revelations about how a cabal of government officials tried to bring down a duly elected president of the United States in what amounts to an attempted coup.\n\nIn fact, the unjust and baseless prosecution of Flynn has more in common with the show trials of dictatorships than it has with the American system of justice.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nLavrentiy Beria, the head of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin\u2019s secret police, once famously said: \u201cShow me the man, and I\u2019ll find you the crime.\u201d This is an eerily accurate description of how the FBI treated Flynn when officials framed him, despite the fact that in reality, he had done nothing illegal.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s well-justified decision to dismiss charges against Flynn may be the end of Flynn\u2019s three-year nightmare.

Cuomo said March 30. Americans heeded his call. On April 2, he announced that some 21,000 health care workers from coast to coast rushed in to aid their countrymen on the Hudson. \u201cThese are beautiful, generous people,\u201d Cuomo said, \u201cand New Yorkers will return the favor.\u201d\n\nCuomo just returned the favor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in a position to provide any subsidies right now because we have a $13 billion deficit,\u201d Cuomo said Tuesday. \u201cWe are in dire financial need.\u201d Consequently, out-of-state medical personnel who earned wages back home while volunteering their talents for at least 14 days must pay New York state tax on such income. Albany also expects full compliance with its dense tax paperwork.\n\nThat morning, Mayor de Blasio was customarily crass. \u201cEvery day, President Trump resembles, more and more, Herbert Hoover, the president who ignored the Great Depression, who didn\u2019t care to put America back on its feet, who has been now remembered in history as someone who failed at the most basic responsibility, which is to protect the people he serves,\u201d de Blasio said.\n\nDe Blasio called President Trump \u201ca former New Yorker who seems to enjoy stabbing his home town in the back\u201d and, while demanding a federal bailout of Gotham\u2019s bloated books, de Blasio added: \u201cI\u2019ll give him another chance to show that there\u2019s a beating heart there\u2026.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio also used grotesque language April 19 while begging Trump for taxpayer dollars: \u201cAre you going to save New York City or are you telling New York City to drop dead?\u201d\n\nThe remarkably self-absorbed de Blasio seems unaware of the Niagara Falls of assistance that Team Trump cascaded into New York City:\n\nThey deployed the Army Corps of Engineers to erect temporary hospitals. In just nine days, the Corps created a 3,000-bed pop-up facility at Manhattan\u2019s Javits Center convention complex. It then fortified this installation with a 48-bed Intensive Care Unit.\n\nTrump dispatched the 1,000-bed hospital ship USNS Comfort to Manhattan. It arrived on March 30 to offer routine care, so onshore hospitals could focus on COVID-19 patients. But Comfort soon was retrofitted to treat virus victims. Of the 182 patients it welcomed, 70 percent were COVID-19-positive.\n\nTrump projected 1,000 military personnel into New York City to hammer COVID-19.\n\nTrump assigned 448 civilian physicians, nurses, and respiratory specialists to NYC\u2019s hospitals.\n\nTrump devoted $1.3 billion in FEMA funds to support New York.\n\nTrump gave FEMA 48 hours to provide New York City four large medical stations with 1,000 beds.\n\nTrump instructed FEMA to supply New York 250 ambulances and 500 emergency medical technicians.\n\nTrump, as of April 2, had steered 4,400 ventilators to New York.\n\nAs of Monday, FEMA Region 2 (which includes New York) had received 478,535 surgical gowns, 875,890 face shields, 4.3 million surgical masks, 9.2 million surgical gloves, 12.8 million N95 respirators and more.\n\nThe reliably partisan and relentlessly embarrassing de Blasio should thank Team Trump for this literal airlift and sealift of emergency support. Instead, he most likely will bash Trump daily, between now and Election Day.\n\nCorey Johnson is Cuomo and de Blasio\u2019s brother in thanklessness. The far-left Democrat who runs the \u00fcber-liberal City Council attacked a group of non-New Yorkers who came in peace to salve COVID-19\u2019s epicenter.\n\nThe Rev. Franklin Graham \u2014 son of the late, legendary preacher Billy Graham \u2014 runs Samaritan\u2019s Purse. This faith-based non-profit arrived March 28, raised 14 tents in Central Park, and created a 68-bed outdoor field hospital.\n\nThe evangelical Christian organization came upon request of Mount Sinai Hospital, just across Fifth Avenue. This fine establishment has treated me, as a loyal and highly satisfied patient of the Mount Sinai Health System. It was founded in 1852 as The Jews Hospital.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSamaritan\u2019s Purse has provided at least 333 New Yorkers with free care. And, since its personnel have labored in the Empire State for more than a fortnight, they must pay New York state taxes on salaries earned as they mended Gothamites.\n\nUnfortunately for Samaritan Purse\u2019s sake, it embraces traditional marriage, which makes it unfiltered evil to Johnson and other local leftists. So, despite claiming that \u201cNYC should be a city for all of us,\u201d Johnson demands that Samaritan\u2019s Purse fold its tents and get lost.\n\n\u201cIt is time for Samaritan\u2019s Purse to leave NYC,\u201d he exploded on May Day, via Twitter. \u201cThis group, led by the notoriously bigoted, hate-spewing Franklin Graham, came at a time when our city couldn\u2019t in good conscience turn away any offer of help. That time has passed. Their continued presence here is an affront to our values of inclusion, and is painful for all New Yorkers who care deeply about the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nSo, a bunch of Christians waded into a disease-filled city chock full of gay people, treated 300+ patients \u2014 in cooperation with an historically Jewish hospital \u2014 without quizzing them about their sexuality or spirituality. And Johnson tells them to bugger off.\n\nWho\u2019s spewing hate here?\n\nIt was OK, Johnson argues, to have these inclusion-affronting homophobes around when New York City needed them. But now that the crisis has abated somewhat, these pain-inducing homophobes should beat it.\n\nJohnson would have been more principled had he blocked Samaritan Purse\u2019s trucks at the Holland Tunnel upon arrival. That stance would have been bold, albeit ugly. But accepting this group\u2019s aid for one month and then telling them to scram is just plain mercenary.\n\nSomething is far more vital here than Samaritan Purse\u2019s private-sector beliefs on gay marriage, a matter that the public-sector U.S. Supreme Court affirmed in June 2015. What\u2019s vital is preventing New Yorkers from dropping dead due to COVID-19, as did 108 disproportionately black and Hispanic Gothamites on May Day alone.\n\nThis escapes Johnson.

This is even as he bragged about violating standard practice in sending FBI agents to interview (and entrap) General Flynn, saying it was \u201csomething I probably wouldn\u2019t have done or gotten away with in a more\u2026organized administration.\u201d\n\nNotice how with a sense of self-righteousness and Washington insider arrogance he blames the Trump administration for his own misdeeds.\n\nWhat we have learned about the FBI under his leadership is disheartening to all who have served honorably within the Department of Justice.\n\nWe all now know many of the names involved in the DOJ\u2019s and FBI\u2019s political campaign against the president\u2014Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Kevin Clinesmith\u2014and their conduct is beyond troubling.\n\nI was chief of staff to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions when he made the decision to fire FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe for lying under oath. The decision was ironic, as McCabe was the one who had initiated the investigation into Sessions for allegedly lying under oath to Congress about having had no discussions with Russian officials during the presidential campaign.\n\nWhat we have learned about the FBI under his leadership is disheartening to all who have served honorably within the Department of Justice.\n\nMcCabe had also been involved with getting General Flynn to plead guilty for making false statements under oath (about speaking with Russian Ambassador Sergy Kislyak after Donald Trump was elected president but before he was inaugurated).\n\nMcCabe was apparently so desperate to polish his reputation in the media that he thought it was worth breaking the law to do so, lying to FBI agents about leaking information to the press.

The documents are shocking, not to Republicans or Democrats, but to Americans.\n\nWe've outlined much of what we knew about the Flynn case in previous segments on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" how a corrupt FBI official called Peter Strzok decided to derail Mike Flynn, using any means necessary. At one point, Strzok considered charging Flynn under something called the Logan Act. The Logan Act is a 220-year old law that in the entire span of American history has never been used to convict a single person. In fact, no one has even been indicted under the Logan Act since before the Civil War.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAnd by the way, it's probably unconstitutional. You probably couldn't do it now if you want it. But Strzok didn't care. His goal was to keep the investigation going, whether he had a legal justification for doing that or not.\n\nBy January 4th of 2017, the FBI had already completed its investigation of Flynn, which was thorough. After four months of looking into Flynn, and they found \"no derogatory information of any kind linking Flynn to Russia.\"\n\nNow, in a fair investigation, the kind that we have a right to expect as Americans, it would have ended right there. And according to the DOJ, it should have ended right there: \"The Department does not believe there was a legitimate basis to investigate and prosecute the designated National Security adviser for communicating with a foreign ambassador and seeking to mollify geopolitical tensions in advance of the inauguration of the next President.\"\n\nHow often does the FBI set people up? How many other lives have they destroyed without the public knowing about it? In other words, this isn't about Michael Flynn. It's about you.\n\nAnd that's the essence of it right there. Michael Flynn did not commit a crime, and they knew it. How did they know? Because the FBI had already tapped Michael Flynn's phone, which itself is a shocking outrage -- completely unacceptable in a free country that, for some reason, nobody in Washington seems to notice or care about. They should.\n\nBecause the FBI already knew what Flynn had said in the call in detail, there was, the Department announced, \"no justification or need to review Mr. Flynn as to his own personal recollections of what had been said.\"\n\nBecause they knew.\n\nIn other words, the whole thing was a setup from the first moment. Now we know this for certain. We're not speculating because we have Peter Strzok's text messages to his creepy government lawyer girlfriend, Lisa Page.\n\nBut what if we didn't have those text messages? We almost didn't. At first, you'll recall, the FBI claimed they had been lost due to some \"technical glitch.\" So, we almost didn't find out what really happened in this case. Michael Flynn almost went to prison.\n\nAnd that gets to the nub of all of this, the most important question of all: How often does the FBI set people up? How many other lives have they destroyed without the public knowing about it? In other words, this isn't about Michael Flynn. It's about you. It's scary to think about that.\n\nMost people in Washington seem determined not to think about it. They are intent on excusing all of this. Ilhan Omar was among the first to chime in on the news today. \"White privilege at work,\" she tweeted.\n\nOmar didn't explain what in the world Mike Flynn's case might have to do with his skin color, which he cannot control. But she denounced the decision is racist, anyway. Surprised? You shouldn't be surprised.\n\nIlhan Omar is a person who clearly married her own brother in an immigration scam, who passionately hates the country that saved her, who reduces every conceivable issue to the most vicious kind of race-baiting.\n\nCan a single human being actually be as loathsome as Ilhan Omar? It's hard to believe. She's like a parody of repulsiveness. Sometimes, you doubt she really exists; the Republican National Committee. must have created her. We can't confirm that, of course.\n\nWe can say with confidence the RNC did not create cable news. The dummies there were almost as angry as Ilhan Omar was. Watch Jeb Bush's former flak take a break from sucking up to professional Harvey Weinstein enablers like Noah Oppenheim to lecture the rest of us about smear campaigns.\n\nNicolle Wallace, MSNBC host: Mike Flynn's lawyers have been engaged in a smear campaign very, very similar, torn out of the same playbook as the smear campaign Donald Trump ran against many of the same FBI leaders.\n\nUnidentified male: The idea that the Justice Department could do this.

This is an absolute injustice.\n\nWhat the federal government did to Mike Flynn was demonstrably and provably unfair, and anyone who refuses to admit that in the face of overwhelming evidence should not wield power.\n\nSo, what exactly are these people saying? What argument are they really making? Mike Flynn was set up by corrupt law enforcement officials. They suggested their goal was to \"get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired.\" That's not speculation. The FBI wrote that down on paper. Flynn faced a maximum of five years in prison.\n\nAre the people you just saw really arguing that Flynn's prosecution was legitimate? Are they arguing he should serve the time behind bars? It's enough to make you dizzy.\n\nKeep in mind, these are supposed to be \"liberals.\" Okay, so whatever happened to their commitment to civil rights? To fairness? In fact, there's nothing liberal about the arguments they are making. This is the most brutal kind of power politics disguised with lies.\n\n\"This moment represents the full collapse of an apolitical Justice Department,\" wrote CNN's legal analyst Susan Hennessey. MSNBC's justice analyst, Matthew Miller, agreed with that: \"Barr is giving Flynn treatment that would not be available to any other American.\"\n\nAnd just in case you wondered if all these responses were coordinated -- because of course, they were -- the world's angriest former labor secretary, Robert Reich, wrote this: \"Under William Barr's stewardship, the Justice Department has become nothing more than a political tool for Trump to wield against his enemies and withdraw against his friends. This is how dictatorships are built.\"\n\nPause and consider this. Once again, it is head-spinning in its falseness. It's the opposite of what's true. Dropping the case against Michael Flynn means the Justice Department is now a political tool? No. Flip it around 180 degrees.\n\nThe attorney general dropped the case because the Justice Department was already being used as a political tool to remove the national security adviser to the United States. That's the whole point. It's not a debate. No honest person could reach any other conclusions. Read the documents yourself.\n\nBut these are not honest people. These are people who applauded when Adam Schiff of California baselessly denounced his political opponents as Russian agents, including this show.\n\nNaturally, Schiff himself weighed in, too. He couldn't help himself: \"Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI. about his illicit Russian contacts. His lies do not now become truths. This dismissal does not exonerate him.\"\n\nWait, what? Is Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, now claiming that a call between the incoming national security adviser and the Russian ambassador to the United States is \"an illicit Russian contact?\" He is claiming that.\n\nThis is insanity, and it is calculated insanity. And in the end, I hate to tell you, it may work. It is entirely possible your grandchildren will be reading Adam Schiff's version of history 20 years from now. That's why they're saying it. That's the goal.\n\nIn the meantime, you should consider what it would mean if unscrupulous liars like these were ever to take full control of this country. They know Michael Flynn is not a dangerous criminal. If he was a dangerous criminal, they would be working to free him from jail.\n\nNo, they wanted Flynn crushed purely because he happened to be in the way of the power they seek. And that's why they're still trying to put Roger Stone behind bars because he mocked them to their faces and that diminished their authority. Roger Stone may still go to prison, by the way -- we'll keep you posted.\n\nBut the question is how many other inconvenient Americans would they bankrupt and imprison if they could? Let's hope we never find out. In the meantime, you should ignore their yelping. Turn it off. This is an offense against equal justice, they scream into the camera. Right.\n\nThe very same people who demand day after day that we hold American citizens to completely different standards based on how they look. Now, they're telling you justice must be blind. It's absurd. It's insulting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe essence of fairness in every country at every time is fairness. Fairness.

With the benefit of diverse skills and backgrounds, our group, which included analysts, collectors and disguise technicians, among others, designed a successful plan. We made secure contact with this high-value target and developed a clandestine relationship with him.\n\nThat sensitive operation, which went off without a hitch, reflected the ethos of inclusion. Striving for a 360-degree optic on the most complex challenges, stakeholders rally to ensure no key issue, viewpoint or analytical angle is neglected. Everyone\u2019s input matters.\n\nThe best leaders for whom I worked enabled a diverse and inclusive environment because of their high moral and ethical standards and because they understood there was no better process for conducting espionage.\n\nTREY GOWDY: WHY FAIRNESS MATTERS \u2014 ALWAYS\n\nDuring the past quarter-century, in particular, these enlightened leaders demonstrated an increasingly serious commitment to promoting officers and selecting them for assignments based on their performance, absent discrimination based on race, ethnicity or gender.\n\nThe promotion of Gina Haspel to lead the CIA and Beth Kimber as the first woman deputy director for operations were long overdue and reflected the time it took to correct for past gender discrimination.\n\nIt was not only progressive leaders who drove this transformational change but also junior female officers like Tracy Walder, author of the recently released \u201cThe Unexpected Spy,\u201d whose extraordinary commitment and expertise helped shatter the CIA\u2019s glass ceiling.\n\nOvercoming floppy baby syndrome and being bullied as a child, Walder went straight to work at CIA after graduating from USC. The Oklahoma City bombing and 1997 Peter Bergen interview with Usama bin Laden sparked her interest in \u201cbeing part of the solution\u201d and led her to serve as an FBI special agent in Los Angeles after leaving CIA in 2004.\n\nFor Walder, serving at CIA was less of a job and more of a calling. When American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, Walder recalled, \u201cthat plane might as well have crashed into the south side of my body.\u201d She was working at CIA in the Counterterrorism Center (CTC) when Al Qaeda struck on Sept. 11. She later served for an extended period in Iraq. She spent her CIA career first targeting terrorists and then the weapons of mass destruction they sought to acquire.\n\nIf there is one thing I learned during my career at CIA, it\u2019s that a person\u2019s true character is revealed under the most stressful situations.\n\nIf there is one thing I learned during my career at CIA, it\u2019s that a person\u2019s true character is revealed under the most stressful situations.

She deftly contended with the misogynist foreign intelligence officers with whom she worked on counterterrorism.

She has been teaching at an all-girls school since leaving the FBI in 2010. She had always wanted to be a teacher but was drawn to public service out of patriotism and the intellectual challenge.\n\nServing in the crucible of post-9/11 CIA and FBI operations, Walder gained the experience, which makes her an exceptional role model.\n\nNo doubt on this Mother\u2019s Day, the Walder family is celebrating motherhood and the extraordinary influence of mothers in our society.

I feel invigorated and called to serve.\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a charismatic leader. Of course you think this whole thing is epic and invigorating. You\u2019ve never been a worrier.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s wrong. I worry a lot. I worry someone I love will die alone in the ICU. I worry my retirement savings won\u2019t come back and I will be cheated out of spending the last years of my life in calm and comfort with the woman I have loved since the moment I first saw her walk into the room 35 years ago.\n\nTREY GOWDY: WHY FAIRNESS MATTERS \u2014 ALWAYS\n\nMy millennial kids and their entire generation will be marked by this crisis for the rest of their lives, the way the Great Depression marked my grandparents, and I fear that most of them will need help for a decade or more before they can fully stand on their own two feet.\n\nI worry my congregation will lose families and our schools will lose students who might now consider religion a luxury not a necessity; leaving themselves, the institution and the community I have worked my entire adult life to build, physically and spiritually empty.\n\nWhen my head aches deep behind my eyes and temples, which it does a lot lately, I worry I have the virus. When I leave the cemetery after burying yet another COVID-19 victim, like the handful of mourners allowed to attend \u2013 distanced, masked, unable to hold or be held \u2013 I feel panic, despair and doubt.\n\nBut I don\u2019t give into fear for long. Instead, I fight back with faith.\n\nIn these surreal, frustrating and anxious months I have turned most often to the 23rd Psalm. Many Jews, Christians and Muslims, and religious and non-religious people, know it well. I have read its famous words for decades, but never has it comforted me more than during these strange, uncertain days, especially the seemingly simple verse \u201cYea though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I shall fear no evil, for You are with me.\u201d\n\nThat simple sentence reminds me that we are all walking, step by step, through something. We will not remain on this terrible journey forever. To have faith is to know this crisis will end. After all, what is a valley of shadows? A shadow, no matter how long or how dark, is actually proof of light. It is impossible for a shadow to exist unless somewhere, somehow a powerful light still shines.\n\nI have already felt glimmers of insight as I travel through the valley of COVID-19. The shadow cast upon the world by this pandemic is frightening and yet, so too an ever-present reminder that even in the darkest hour, our light, God\u2019s light, the light of our love for the dearest of family and friends, the light of our love for our cities, neighborhoods and the simplest blessings of daily life we so often took for granted, still shine.\n\nCOVID-19 has stripped away a lot of nonsense from my life and in that stripping away something beautiful has emerged; a knowing that we were better meant to be home, closer to God and the people we love most.\n\nAnd like many, I am asking enlightening questions. Do we really need so many suits, ties, shoes, purses and outfits to wear? How many meetings do we really need to attend? Did we need to spend so much time away from home for so many years? How much do we have to spoil the earth by driving and buying, driving and buying, driving and buying?\n\nCOVID-19 has stripped away a lot of nonsense from my life and in that stripping away something beautiful has emerged; a knowing that we were better meant to be home, closer to God and the people we love most.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe days of the ancient Jewish calendar begin at sunset; darkness pregnant with light. The Hebrew months begin when the moon is new, in its darkest phase, just a slim crescent of light against the black sky. The Sages remind us that we see light through our pupil, the darkest part of our eye. It is powerful and profound that the Talmud requires even the blind to recite the ancient blessing for the new moon; affirming with faith what cannot be seen.\n\nRight now, we are all called to affirm a light we sometimes cannot see through our anxiety, pain and tears. Darkness is the moment for faith.\n\nBelieve me, I am not campaigning for it, nor does the position exist, but if there was such a job as Chief Rabbi of Those Who Suffer, and I held that job, here is what I would say to the world right now. I would remind everyone that life is long. Long enough to restart, to rebuild, to take more pictures, to create more memories, to heal. I would remind them to have faith that the moon will soon enough be full, reflecting the sun\u2019s great power for warmth and light.

It doesn\u2019t care about how other diseases work, even when it looks closely related to them.\n\nThis terrible new enemy wreaks havoc on its victims, unchecked and unphased by any and all therapies we throw at it. Only recently have we identified a well-known, simplistic but effective intervention \u2013 proning (putting patients on their stomach) \u2013 as being efficacious. But it\u2019s not a cure, simply a way to buy time for patients to hopefully heal on their own.\n\nCOVID-19 leaves physicians feeling inept and weaponless in this battle. We push experimental therapies, adapt interventions meant for other diseases with limited success and chase laboratory values that would otherwise spell impending disaster yet rapidly correct days later without intervention.\n\nROBERT RUNCIE: CORONAVIRUS RELIEF \u2013 WHY SCHOOLS MUST BE THE HEART OF NEXT STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\nIt feels as if we are shooting arrows against a brick wall in a feeble attempt to breach it; any crack in the mortar is a hope that is dashed away by the fact the wall still stands. Yet, we all carry on.\n\nOn the orders of physicians, our teammates in nursing, physical therapy and respiratory therapy are donning re-used and decontaminated protective gear (meant to be worn once) to enter the rooms of infected patients innumerable times per shift to draw labs, adjust infusion doses and help to prone them. This exposes them to the virus time and time again. Each decision we make as physicians to obtain an additional lab or add a new medication weighs on us that much more.\n\nThis all takes a significant toll on the mental health of our health care providers. While we are used to dealing with difficult situations and death, this is a whole new beast. This unseen enemy threatens us directly and constantly. Did I touch my mask before washing my hands? What about when I adjusted my glasses? Did I just infect myself? These thoughts cross our minds hundreds of times throughout the day.\n\nCOVID-19 lives in our workplaces, in our neighborhoods and in our own homes. Arriving home each day, even though I leave my hospital scrubs and shoes at work, I still take my shoes off outside my door and disrobe completely after entering my house. I immediately throw my street clothes in the wash and jump in the shower to get clean \u2013 scrubbing under every fingernail and inch of my body. I wipe down my phone, keys, wallet and backpack with disinfecting wipes and then wash my hands again.\n\nAs hard as this is for the patients and health care providers, it is worse for families. They are unable to see just how sick and close to death their loved ones are. It\u2019s almost impossible to comprehend that their loved one could get this sick, this quickly, when days earlier they were walking around in the park together.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain but what often happens is these patients were maintaining some baseline level of function but underneath, they were likely sitting on the edge of a cliff that was only revealed once they were infected with COVID-19. Then the curtain was pulled back and we could see how unhealthy they really were. We see this in \u201cotherwise healthy\u201d younger patients who have undiagnosed high blood pressure, high cholesterol and obesity. And, of course, older patients who before the virus could \u201cmanage just fine,\u201d but needed assistance with daily activities or couldn\u2019t really walk more than a few feet without stopping.\n\nWe break down. We cry. We feel our breath get short and chest get tight. \u201cIs this COVID or just anxiety?\u201d we wonder.\n\nThe families plead with us on Zoom calls, asking for experimental therapies they saw on TV or in an Internet search. How do you explain that these are just experimental, not always available and, in the age of evidence-based medicine, will not likely be administered without a clinical trial to evaluate effectiveness? While always grateful for our efforts, they continue to push and push, offering to send us articles and news stories, and who can blame them? I would want everything to be tried for my family member as well \u2013 even if there is no evidence for it. But that\u2019s not how medicine works.\n\nWhile connecting with patients and families has always been a significant part of the job for ICU doctors, it has become almost a full-time endeavor \u2013 explaining behind a mask and over video conference with our palliative care colleagues, why we can\u2019t \u201cjust inject donor plasma\u201d into their loved one. The emotional burden weighs heavy as well, from family members who feel guilty for infecting their loved one, to those whose family member we suggest is made \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d because they likely wouldn\u2019t benefit from chest compressions if their heart stopped.\n\nThey inevitably break down crying, inconsolable. And it is made all the worse because we cannot reach out to hold their hand from behind a screen.\n\nWe break down too, inside. We look at each other after these calls \u2013 \u201cThat was terrible. This is terrible. What else can we do?\u201d Nothing. And so, we get on, calling the next family. Because that\u2019s all we can do. It is overwhelming, yet we hold it together for the families and each other.\n\nThe virus is constantly on our minds and feels impossible to escape. Even when we\u2019re off duty it sits there. In the conversations with families that we replay in our minds. In the burden of knowing we asked the seasoned nurse, a member of the higher risk age groups, to enter the room and expose herself to the virus again. In the questions and concerns from our own families. And constantly, unwaveringly, on TV.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWe break down. We cry.

But importantly, the accuser\u2019s claims need to be subject to rigorous investigation free of any presumption of guilt. After all, our entire justice system is based on the principle that anyone accused of a crime is presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nDEVOS PROCLAIMS TITLE IX RULE CHANGE FOR CAMPUS SEX ASSAULT CASES 'REBALANCES THE SCALES OF JUSTICE'\n\nThe purpose of the new Education Department rules \u2013 issued under the authority of the federal anti-discrimination statute known as Title IX \u2013 is to ensure that \"every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined,\" Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said.\n\nIn order to ensure that guilt is not predetermined, the rules guarantee due process for accused students \u2013 something that was sorely lacking under the Obama administration's 2011 guidance on the same topic.\n\nThe new due process requirements for universities include: the presumption of innocence; written notice of the allegations; an opportunity for the accuser and accused to review the evidence; a live hearing; an impartial decision-maker; and the right of the accused and accuser to each be represented by an adviser who can cross-examine and challenge evidence, subject to the typical \"rape shield\" exceptions.\n\nThe accuser is also protected from having to come face-to-face with the accused during the hearing and is not required to divulge any medical or psychological records. Schools are required to respond promptly to all reports of sexual misconduct and to investigate all complaints filed.\n\nALYSSA MILANO EXPLAINS SILENCE ON JOE BIDEN SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATION, SAYS MEN DESERVE \u2018DUE PROCESS\u2019\n\nThe new rules also increase transparency. Colleges are required to disclose the materials used to train their Title IX staff. Transcripts or recordings of hearings must be kept and made available to the parties. And the parties cannot be prohibited from speaking about the allegations.\n\nCompare that to the Obama administration guidance. The guidance came in a \"Dear Colleague letter\" that did not go through the notice and comment process required for regulations and was withdrawn in 2017. The letter encouraged schools to deny due process protections to accused students \u2013 even when they faced expulsion \u2013 and mandated the lowest possible standard of proof for conviction.\n\nAs a result, accused students were commonly denied the presumption of innocence and even access to evidence favorable to their defense, as well as the details of the charges against them.\n\nThe 2011 letter was inspired by the same \"women need to be believed\" mantra that we've been hearing from Democrats and their allies until very recently. The most notable example came when Christine Blasey Ford alleged now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when both were teenagers. Exactly like Biden, Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegation against him.\n\nBiden's take on Ford was typical of comments Democrats made during Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing for a seat on the Supreme Court: \"You\u2019ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she\u2019s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts,\" Biden said.\n\nHence, it's not surprising that Democrats liked the Obama guidance, despite their traditional support for due process (even for illegal immigrants), and attacked Secretary DeVos' proposal for new rules in November 2018.\n\nOne of the critics of the proposed new rules was Joe Biden, who championed the 2011 guidance as vice president. This is an interesting stance for someone whose inappropriate touching could easily lead to a Title IX hearing if he were a student.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., joined in the criticism, characterizing the proposed Education Department rules and their due process guarantees as \"utter contempt for survivor justice.\"\n\nActress and #MeToo activist Alyssa Milano called the proposed regulations \"Betsy's s----- gift.\"\n\nYet those same Democrats and their countless like-minded colleagues are now calling for due process for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president in the November election.\n\nAddressing the allegation against Biden, Pelosi paid lip service to \"the idea that women will be heard and be listened to,\" but added that \"there\u2019s also due process.\u201d\n\nMilano responded to the allegation with a sudden realization, saying: \u201cSo we have to find this balance in the 'believe women movement' and also giving men their due process. And, you know, realizing that we're destroying lives, if we publicly don't go through the right steps in order to find out if an accusation is credible or not.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nEven Biden was not afraid of looking like a hypocrite. Asked about the allegation against him on MSNBC, he qualified \"believing the woman\" by adding \"then it's vetted, looked into.\u201d\n\nGiven this change of heart in recent weeks, Democrats and their allies might have rethought their opposition to the new Title IX rules. But the early indications, following Wednesday's release of the finalized regulations, indicate otherwise.\n\nBiden immediately denounced the rules, saying they would \u201cstrip survivors of their rights,\u201d and vowed to reverse them. Similarly, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said \"this rule is not about \u2018restoring balance,\u2019 this is about silencing survivors.\"\n\nYou'd think that Joe Biden would finally understand that only a fair adjudication process can determine which party in an alleged sexual assault is the true survivor of an injustice.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nInstead, Biden, Murray and their colleagues continue to mischaracterize due process, the linchpin of American justice, as \"silencing\" the accuser \u2013 at least when the person who is accused is not a prominent Democrat.\n\nJoe Biden wants the presumption of innocence when he is accused of sexual assault, but doesn\u2019t want students accused of sexual misconduct to get the same right.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY CURT LEVEY", "author": ["Curt Levey", "Curt Levey Is President Of The"]}]}, "entrepreneur_latest": {"rss": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/entrepreneur/latest", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/", "articles": [{"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/H2aWLpK3Ry4/348711", "published": "2020-05-09T20:15:00", "title": "How to Think More Effectively During a Crisis", "text": "May 9, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nDuring times of uncertainty, fear and anxiety, it\u2019s easy to become overwhelmed by the world around us. As we search for security and stability, we might be faced with all the things we can\u2019t control: the decisions our legislators make, the state of our healthcare system, whether our loved ones get sick and dozens and other circumstances. However, if we choose to, we can take solace in what we can control \u2014 which is a lot.\n\nTimes of crisis are ripe with opportunity to remember that we are in control of our own thoughts, which in turn control our emotions and our actions. While it takes discipline and intentionality to put this practice into action, this concept is rooted in proven research in cognitive psychology. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nYou experience the world. Something happens \u2013 your governor issues a stay-at-home mandate, your child gets sick or you can\u2019t make payroll. These events are facts that haven\u2019t been shaped by your own opinions, interpretations or assumptions. They simply exist, and they have a neutral charge; only you assign them positive or negative meaning.\n\nYou create your thoughts. In an attempt to make sense of your external environment, you consciously and unconsciously untangle what\u2019s going on around you. For example, an interpretation that might resonate during a crisis is: \u201cMy business is in a state of chaos.\u201d\n\nYour thoughts cause your emotions. If you think your business is in a state of chaos, your feelings will follow suit, causing emotions like anxiety, frustration and panic.\n\nYour emotions cause your actions. You respond to your feelings by acting, reacting or not acting at all. You might rush to lay off employees without thinking through the consequences, or you might be in denial and not do anything.\n\nYour actions create your life. What you do and what you don\u2019t do shape your personal world, and they\u2019re all set into motion by the thoughts you created after the initial event.\n\nWhen we view our experiences through this lens, we see that most of the model is within our sphere of influence; the only thing we can't control is what happens around us. What we do in response to those circumstances is where the magic happens.\n\nYour first response in a state of crisis might be: \u201cI can\u2019t possibly work from home, be a parent and a teacher, manage my business, be productive, and be okay at the end of it.\u201d But what happens if you take time to notice those thoughts and intentionally shift them to something else? As a general rule, these new thoughts shouldn\u2019t be complete opposites of the original thought; it won't serve us to replace the thought with, \u201cThis is fun; I love chaos.\u201d Our brain simply won\u2019t believe it. Instead, we can make minor shifts toward a more neutral state of mind with thoughts like:\n\n\u201cAll I need to do is get through today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew this would be hard, but I survived another day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d\n\nWith that change in thought, our feelings \u2014 and thus our actions and results \u2014 can change. Rather than feeling a negative emotion, we might instead feel something more neutral or even positive: acceptance, contentment or hope.\n\nAs those thoughts influence our actions, we face the day with new energy and with more control over that energy. Instead of reacting or not acting at all, we might have the energy to be proactive, feeling more powerful and in control than we did before.\n\nWhile this exercise is certainly helpful in our current environment, this universal concept is applicable to any bad situation: the loss of a major client, a down year, or other unforeseeable circumstances in your business and personal life.\n\nThe next time it feels like it\u2019s all crashing down around you, take a moment to breathe. Try to separate fact from fiction so you can better interpret your circumstance, shift your thoughts, and control your emotions, actions and results. The goal isn\u2019t to completely rid your life of negativity \u2014 there\u2019s certainly a place for negative emotions, and a biological reason we feel them. Instead, acknowledge them, live in them for a moment and work to neutralize them so you can move into the future with more clarity, confidence and control.\n\nNote about the contributors: This article is co-authored by Aileron President Joni Fedders and Aileron Facilitator and Coach Erika Alessandrini.", "author": ["Joni Fedders"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/IA-JFNWSaNY/350362", "published": "2020-05-09T17:30:00", "title": "What It Takes to Build a Business, Starting With the 'Eureka!'

Unemployment is at 14.7%, the highest rate since the US Bureau of Labor Statistics started tracking it in 1948.\n\nA poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, conducted March 25 to 30, found that 45 percent of adults say the pandemic has affected their mental health, and 19 percent say it has had a \u201cmajor impact.\u201d\n\nThe statistics are dismal:\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimates that issues related to employee mental health and substance abuse cost American employers between $80 billion and $100 billion per year.\n\nAs many as 20%t of U.S. adults will experience mental illness in their lifetimes, according to the NIMH, and 66 percent will never receive treatment.\n\nDepression alone affects 18.8 million American adults per year, or 9.5 percent of the population, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nPatients with depression miss about 19.2 workdays per year and experience 46 days of reduced productivity.\n\nThis stark reality is a tremendous threat to business, which presents an opportunity for entrepreneurs, hidden in plain sight. How can business owners transform our life\u2019s challenges, childhood traumas, and mental health struggles into a business opportunity that improves people\u2019s lives and uplifts communities around the world?\n\nBrett Kaufman is reshaping Columbus, Ohio from the ground up \u2014 literally. He\u2019s the CEO and founder of Kaufman Development and creator of Gravity in the Franklinton area of Columbus. Kaufman has gone through an amazing life journey that allowed him to develop extremely creative real estate communities, a podcast, an executive coaching business, new approaches to venture capital funding, and investment opportunities that are creating even more impact, wealth, and abundance for the Columbus area.\n\nFor the past 20 years, Kaufman Development has developed over $1 billion in real estate projects focused on enhancing the human experience, bringing people closer to each other, their passions, and creating lives that honor who they truly are. Gravity is his Magnum Opus, the latest and fullest expression of his work.\n\nKaufman is passionate about upgrading the human experience. He\u2019s founded a number of companies and invested in entrepreneurs to investigate new ways to celebrate their unique experiences and challenges to help others navigate their own journeys. His mission is about integrating expression, impact and well-being. How can business owners, artists, and professionals enable better life experiences and improve our communities -- and the planet -- in the process?\n\nKaufman\u2019s mixed-use communities integrate work-life alignment with unconventional amenities including meditation rooms, coworking spaces, on-site therapy facilities, restaurants, affordable apartments, and murals by local artists. The design, events, programs, education, and physical layout are all intended to enable residents to connect with their passions and each other.\n\nHe envisions a day when mental health resources are as common and accepted as physical health and working out. With a deep appreciation for therapy and working with coaches and other kinds of self-help mentors and experts, Kaufman is upending the experience of office visits with Innerspace. The solution is a bright, modern space that will include private, sound-proof suites for practitioners to practice in person and via video conference. It\u2019s a combination that will shatter stigmas while still addressing obvious needs for privacy and confidentiality.\n\nFurther, Kaufman is changing the whole industry model for the people working as coaches, therapists, dietitians, massage therapists who more often work alone, and struggle to find office space that provides the kind of nurturing architecture and design that their clients expect at anything like an affordable cost.\n\nRecently he spoke in front of 1200 people at the Columbus Chamber of Commerce\u2019s annual meeting about the importance of therapy and being a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d Speaking in front of that many people was a first for Kaufman.\n\nKaufman spent his early career in banking environments with very little inspiration, purpose or passion -- people lived for the weekends, vacations or retirements. Through his own life\u2019s journey, Kaufman discovered an alternative approach: one in which you could embrace your passions and integrate activities that feel like hobbies into your professional life.\n\nThe Gravity community reflects this ethos. It\u2019s a space for residents to more easily access their passions: for example, they can live, work, and volunteer, join a club, attend a fitness class, or work with a like-minded therapist in one place.\n\nKaufman\u2019s personal brand has become an extension of Gravity. He shares the principles and backstory of Gravity in a signature keynote, the Gravity podcast, and a book scheduled to be published this year. He advises, coaches, and works with other executives to help them integrate their passions and careers with impact. The process starts with an in-depth discovery session to discover their goals, intentions and life experience.\n\nToday, entrepreneurs have the opportunity to build successful businesses, make a positive impact, and pursue their passions all at the same time. Kaufman is an inspiring example of how we can integrate, rather than silo, these three critical aspects of the human experience.\n\nTo learn more about Brett Kaufman and Gravity, check out his website here: www.Brett-Kaufman.com\n\nWatch the whole video interview here: www.MrBz.com/BrettKaufman", "author": ["Mike Koenigs"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/Icr0ciHKqEA/350292", "published": "2020-05-09T13:00:00", "title": "Skip a Trip to the Market.

But no franchise systems have had to face the breadth and depth of the economic impacts of our current and uncertain times.\n\nThe good news? Franchise sales will rebound eventually, and given an extended, months-long lead-to-sale timeframe, franchisors can start preparing their organizations and ramping up their lead generation efforts right now.\n\nThree core factors will primarily contribute to this resurgence, and they're the same factors that drive franchise sales, in general, no matter the state of the economy: people, capital and resources.\n\nPeople\n\nThe unemployment rate is expected to average close to 14 percent for the second quarter of 2020, and it may reach 16 percent for the third quarter before beginning to decrease slightly beginning in Q4. Even many of those who have not lost their jobs yet are underemployed or looking over one shoulder to see if they will be the next to go.\n\nOne of the reasons franchise sales have traditionally fared well during a down economy is that unemployment or underemployment often spurs people to take the leap into becoming their own boss. As we have seen in past recessions, when businesses restart, there may not be an immediate return to the same number of employment opportunities \u2014 especially at the high end of the market.\n\nMany of the people whose jobs have been affected, reduced or eliminated will have the hard and soft skills typically associated with franchise success (business experience, technology skills, leadership style and a willingness to follow systems). If they are not able to return to their previous positions, or are leery of returning to the corporate world, these people are naturally going to be looking for viable alternatives to provide for their families and futures. Franchise ownership may be a natural fit for many of these displaced professionals.\n\nRelated: The Top 20 Franchises of 2020 From the Entrepreneur Franchise 500\n\nCapital\n\nFranchise ownership is, of course, not the answer for all people who find themselves unemployed. Most likely, franchising will be attractive to those who have a nest egg, a severance package or other financial resources they can tap to purchase a franchise.\n\nThe upcoming months should provide greater access to lending for these future franchisees. Low-cost capital is available now in conjunction with government programs to support small business growth. The growing list of incentives from the SBA will help encourage small business growth, just as it did during the recession a decade ago. Franchisor sales personnel (in-house, brokers or franchise sales outsourcing) need to be knowledgeable about the funding options available in order to facilitate the sale and avoid hiccups in securing financing.\n\nResources\n\nUnfortunately, some businesses will fail in the current climate. The commercial real estate market was already seeing vacancies, and the impacts of prolonged shutdowns will likely result in even more prime locations becoming available. It can, therefore, be expected that landlords will be willing to negotiate and offer favorable deals for prime locations. New franchise owners or current ones looking to expand as the economy re-opens will be able to capitalize on these favorable terms for their brick and mortar locations.\n\nThe same can be said for other vendors and suppliers to the franchise industry who have taken a severe hit during the crisis. Savvy entrepreneurs will see this as an ideal time to start a new business, leveraging the special post-shutdown concessions, pricing and terms that suppliers are no doubt going to be offering. And perhaps most importantly, there will be increased availability of labor for the franchise location due to hourly and other employees who are looking for work, answering the employment shortage that many businesses felt pre-COVID.\n\nDespite the anticipated resurgence in franchise sales, one word of caution to franchisors: There will eventually be pent-up demand on all sides to get business back to a \u201cnew normal.\u201d\n\nFor some businesses, this new normal may impact the underlying business economics of the model itself. And for those businesses, the difficult-but-wise choice will be to remain on the sidelines while adapting to the new world order. For those businesses that continue to prosper, it will be more important than ever to maintain the integrity of the franchise candidate evaluation and sales processes in the face of increased demand. It will be critical not only to ensure buyers are well-capitalized but that they are a good fit for the franchise brand and system in terms of experience, skills, philosophy and expansion goals.\n\nFranchise sales are likely to surge in the years to come. When they do, the vital role that franchising plays in the economy will become more evident than ever before. Businesses looking to launch or continue their franchise programs would be well-advised to use this time wisely and prepare expansion strategies, make operational adjustments and shore up marketing tools and messages in anticipation of the resurgence.", "author": ["Mark Siebert"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/txKpT7SjqsQ/349946", "published": "2020-05-08T17:45:00", "title": "10 Movies All Entrepreneurs Should Watch on Amazon", "text": "May 8, 2020 9 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\ncan be a great source of inspiration and , and a fun way to expand your knowledge base.\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with , you probably already know that the online shopping platform has a video streaming service.

But there\u2019s so much to choose from that it can be a bit overwhelming.\n\nRelated: 10 TV Shows Every Entrepreneur Should Watch on Netflix\n\nThe films listed below offer important lessons on a variety of topics relevant to entrepreneurs. To help you get the most out of your movie-watching experience, I\u2019ve sorted these films under key topics and categorized them as being available to rent through Amazon, or available to watch for free through Amazon Prime.\n\nThese 10 movies go beyond entertainment: They set high standards and showcase the skills and drive you\u2019ll need to be a success, as well as warn against greed and corruption.\n\nStories that bring Wall Street to life\n\nFrom corrupt stockbrokers to astute hedge fund managers, these movies capture some of Wall Street\u2019s most intriguing true stories.\n\n1. The Wolf of Wall Street \u2013 available for rent through Amazon\n\nThis hit movie tells a wild, over-the-top tale that happens to be based on a true story. The plot revolves around scam-artist stockbroker Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), who takes an entry level job at a Wall Street brokerage firm.\n\nWhat to watch for: Belfort was a great entrepreneur who successfully built something out of nothing, but unfortunately his company was riddled with corruption and deceit. This story offers entrepreneurs important lessons, not the least of which is: Don\u2019t be a crook.\n\n2. The Big Short \u2013 watch for free through Amazon Prime\n\nThe Big Short tells the story of a group of Wall Street fund managers and investors who were able to see the looming housing market crisis long before it began to implode in 2007 and 2008. The movie chronicles the work of hedge fund manager Michael Burry (played by Christian Bale), who discovers that financial institutions are bundling risky subprime mortgages into \u201cAAA-rated\u201d prime mortgage\u2212backed securities that were sold to investors. He realizes the U.S. housing market is perched atop a huge asset bubble that is about to burst.\n\nWhat to watch for: Burry creates a credit default swap that allows him to short, or bet against, those bonds, making his investors a bundle of money when the housing market tanks. The biggest lesson here is that while everyone else scoffed at him because they believed the market was unbreakable, Burry stuck to his guns and his strategy paid off.\n\nThe story behind American icon Walt Disney\n\nWalt Disney was a pioneer in animation and in the entertainment industry. These movies take a deeper look at his backstory and the creative process he used to create his iconic characters.\n\n3. Saving Mr. Banks \u2013 rent through Amazon\n\nThis movie tells the story behind Walt Disney\u2019s quest to obtain the rights to P.L. Travers\u2019 novel Mary Poppins. Despite Disney\u2019s best efforts, Travers rebuffs every offer he makes because she fears Disney\u2019s version of her story won\u2019t be true to the characters she has created. She criticizes every step in the process to adapt the book into a movie script, nearly upending the project.\n\nWhat to watch for: The delicate way Disney handles this situation. He could have easily let the project sink or tried to pressure Travers to comply. Instead, he seeks to better understand her concerns and hear her out. He eventually finds a way to win her over, and his tenacity results in a movie that won universal acclaim and audience adoration for generations to come.\n\n4. Walt Before Mickey \u2013 available for free through Amazon Prime\n\nWhile you have likely heard about Walt Disney\u2019s many accomplishments, you may not be familiar with the many difficulties he faced on the way to success. Walt Before Mickey depicts a number of failures Disney had to overcome as he doggedly built a career for himself in animated films. This is the story of Disney\u2019s early years. Before he created Mickey Mouse, Disney created another famous animated character, Oswald Rabbit. But Disney didn't own the copyright to that character, and he had to let Oswald go.\n\nWhat to watch for: Owning your work is one of the many lessons he learned on the bumpy road to success \u2014 and a good one for entrepreneurs to take away from this film. By the time Walt created Mickey, he was on his fourth animation company and it is the one that stuck: Walt Disney Studios.\n\nStories behind famous business feuds\n\nThroughout history, businesses have feuded for a variety of reasons. Sometimes these conflicts become epic and can drive businesses to the brink \u2014 or propel them to new heights.\n\n5. Ford v Ferrari \u2013 rent through Amazon\n\nIn the 1960s, automaker Ford's then-president Henry Ford II tried to buy luxury sports car manufacturer Ferrari, but the deal fell through at the last minute. Ford v Ferrari stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale and chronicles how Henry Ford II's disappointment turned into revenge, prompting him to create a new car that could beat Ferrari's model at Le Mans, the world's oldest active sports car endurance race.\n\nWhat to watch for: Consider how Ferrari executives don\u2019t take Ford seriously as a competitor, and the impact that has. The movie also shows how Ford\u2019s project passes through numerous middle managers, which likely reduces the overall efficiency of their operations.\n\n6. Adidas vs. Puma: The Brothers\u2019 Feud \u2013 watch for free through Amazon Prime\n\nThe movie depicts the story behind two of the world\u2019s most renowned shoe companies, which stems from a vicious family feud that not only pitted two brothers against one another but also divided the inhabitants of their small hometown in Germany. Note: this is a German-language film with English subtitles.\n\nWhat to watch for: The rivalry between these two brands went far beyond corporate competition, but it also undoubtedly pushed both companies to excel. The movie shows how different business approaches resulted in the development of two of the most powerful sports brands in the world. It ultimately begs the question: If it weren\u2019t for this family rivalry, would these companies be where they are today?\n\nThe story behind the world\u2019s largest fast-food chain\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that McDonald\u2019s is the largest fast-food chain in the world and has revolutionized our eating habits \u2014 for better or for worse. The origin story behind McDonald\u2019s offers great insights into how innovation is born when people are willing to think outside the box to solve customer problems.\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s empire we know today exists largely because of a man whose last name is not McDonald. In 1948, the McDonald brothers debuted a revolutionary kitchen assembly line during a time when drive-ins were still king. Enter Ray Kroc, who delivered several milkshake mixers to the McDonald brothers in 1954. Kroc was in awe of what they had created, and he had a vision for how he could take their \u201cgolden arches\u201d from coast to coast. Kroc eventually bought the business \u2014 and the rights to the McDonald\u2019s name. Today the company is worth more than $100 billion, and Kroc is considered its founder.\n\nWhat to watch for: Not only does the movie show how important it is to never give up; it also throws light on other aspects of business, such as the importance of having a good team, and why it\u2019s crucial to have all legalities in place.\n\n8. The Real Founder \u2013 watch for free through Amazon prime\n\nThe Real Founder features an interview with Dick McDonald, who, along with his brother Maurice, started the McDonald\u2019s restaurant chain. Dick McDonald offers his side of the story, describing how they opened a drive-in restaurant in Southern California, which became one of the most popular in town.\n\nWhat to watch for: If you\u2019ve seen The Founder, this documentary will give you a different perspective. The Real Founder offers the backstory on how the McDonald brothers came up with their own innovations to speed up food service, and even began franchising the restaurant long before Ray Kroc was part of the story.\n\nStories of women inventors who succeeded and failed\n\nThe key elements of success often come down to having drive, ambition and talent; however, as these movies show, you need to back that up with a solid product that performs as advertised.\n\n9. Joy \u2013 rent through Amazon\n\nThis movie captures the challenges of a woman entrepreneur and has a wonderful message for all women looking to build a successful company. Joy is based on the life of Joy Mangano, a self-made millionaire who created a business empire.\n\nWhat to watch for: This movie is about beating all odds and breaking the glass ceiling. But the best lesson here is that if you want to build a big, successful company, you need to get ready to go to war every day, rain or shine. Success means being willing to fight a multi-front battle.\n\n10. The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley \u2013 watch for free through Amazon Prime\n\nThis documentary follows the story of Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, a blood-testing startup business. She led the public to believe that her device, the Edison, could perform dozens of blood tests with just a single finger prick.

According to the minds at Harvard Business School, it\u2019s never been easier for businesses of all sizes to collect, analyze and interpret data into real, actionable insights. Companies wanting to successfully scale their operations should make the effort to understand that data on a much deeper level.\n\nRelated: The Insane Amounts of Data We're Using Every Minute (Infographic)\n\nFully understanding the needs of your consumer enables you to provide them with the specific products and services they may be looking for, resulting in optimal business decisions surrounding exactly how, when and what to sell them. This is a fundamental aspect of creating and operating a business. Data-driven decision-making is simply focusing on the needs of your target market and executing on those requests before they are made.\n\nAll data is not created equal\n\n\u201cI think people just don\u2019t understand the value in qualitative research,\u201d says Lynzie Riebling, vice president of insights and strategy at Revolt TV. Riebling, whose background is in psychology and marketing, explained to me the level of \"quant bias\" she's seen in the entertainment industry. \u201cWe are programmed as humans to think if something is quantified it has to be accurate,\u201d she says of how we tend to view the numbers gained from research. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how that survey was programmed, you don\u2019t know who they spoke to, you don\u2019t know if that was a survey of five people or 5,000 people.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Your Startup Needs Data Science\n\nActing as the middleman between brands and consumers, Riebling has spent more than a decade understanding the perspectives of target audiences and reporting that information back to the leadership of notable brands including Nike, Google/YouTube and MTV. By reading between the lines in data findings, she has helped countless executives make decisions to create with their audiences in mind. \u201cI always say insights are your closest thing to a crystal ball,\u201d says Riebling of the significance of her field. \u201cIf we do our work properly, we can tell you based on human behavior what is likely to happen next.\u201d\n\nKeeping it simple\n\nThe data of today is more detailed and varied than ever before, but there\u2019s no need for to get overwhelmed by the numbers. Though data has gotten bigger and better with time, success is not contingent upon harnessing the power of big data.\n\n\u201cI think people get wrapped up in this idea that you have to do something statistically sound,\u201d mentions Riebling of the DIY role her job often assumes. \u201cI\u2019ve legitimately gone into a skate park and bought a pizza and said \u2018Hey, do you guys want to hang out and eat pizza?\u2019 It might sound a bit creepy, but it worked.\u201d Riebling believes that even small businesses can do their own insight-scraping and data-reporting with limited friends, supporters or colleagues. \u201cAs humans, we can just have conversations with people and that is research and validation in itself.\"\n\nTurning insights into action\n\nDoing independent research is costly and time-intensive, but data doesn't necessarily have to come from research done on behalf of your company alone. The creation of the platform Audiomack is a prime example of what can be accomplished by using known research and applying that knowledge to your target audience. In 2012, the founders of the music streaming service decided to launch their business from their own perspectives as hip-hop fans, noticing the genre\u2019s growing reach at the time.\n\nAudiomack was built on providing those hip-hop artists who couldn\u2019t yet afford the fees often required by distribution companies and other streaming platforms with a free and unlimited way to upload their music. Understanding the nature of the hip-hop creative process and the challenge of getting past industry gatekeepers, the founders gave artists a chance to put their music directly in front of the right fans. By also catering to listeners who are specifically looking to stream underground hip-hop content that can\u2019t be found in places like Apple Music or Spotify, today Audiomack attracts 14 million daily active users.\n\nI recently spoke with David Ponte, co-founder and CMO of Audiomack, who explained how the company\u2019s Creator Dashboard is helping artists turn the data from the service\u2019s platform into actionable insights. \u201cThat type of specific data is going to help you understand where to push your resources,\u201d Ponte says of the dashboard\u2019s geo-location and engagement metrics. \u201cIf you\u2019re an emerging artist, you want to be able to determine where you might want to contact booking agents. You can see, \u2018Are people coming back to play a song or are they just playing it because it\u2019s in a big playlist?\u2019 Those answers are going to help you determine how to spend your money and your time moving forward.\u201d\n\nWhen used correctly, carefully mined data can help a company determine which path to take. Better data leads to better decision-making and more efficient selling strategies, both of which are key to profitability.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways Data Is Driving Conscious Capitalism", "author": ["Luis Garcia"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/dY9_Ezox5_c/350395", "published": "2020-05-08T17:13:00", "title": "Should I Return My Small-Business Loan?", "text": "May 8, 2020 10 min read\n\nAs we reported earlier this week, you now have until Thursday, May 14 to return your SBA (PPP) loan if you feel like the forgiveness guidance is too stringent or \u2014 as has been the case primarily with mid-size and large companies \u2014 you've unwittingly opened yourself up to possible audit or, worse, criminal inquiry.\n\nTo answer the pressing question of whether you should remand whatever the federal program bequeathed or use it as a launching pad to reopen your business, we spoke with Rachel Scava, COO of Ohio-based accounting and finance firm Fully Accountable, which works primarily with small-to-mid-sized businesses. Her advice? Well, it depends on host of factors, but the bottom line is: Don't rely on your lender or the government to light the path. The time to soul search about the future of your business is now. Here are edited excerpts from our conversation.\n\nWas this extension a consequence of larger companies lobbying for time?\n\nDefinitely. My opinion on why they set the deadline is a couple of reasons. Number one is, with the way this process has worked in general, you have a group of people that probably applied before the May 7 deadline that still haven't received their loan and now is wondering: Am I actually a candidate? What do I do if I get my funds? There's a pretty arbitrary standard for this term \"necessary\" that the CARES Act is using. [Treasury Secretary Steve] Mnuchin has repeatedly alluded to the fact that they are trying to dissuade people from taking the money if they don't actually need it, and by continuing to extend that, it's making people less wanting to jump in and go for the funds, because it is a bit of a fear tactic. The other piece of it is, we don't even have all the businesses open yet. For those people who got their money on May 8 or 9, and their clock of the eight weeks [to use the money to be eligible for forgiveness] has started ticking, maybe it's not in their best interest to have that money right now because they may not meet the requirements for forgiveness.\n\nEven as more money gets returned, does applying for or accepting available funds become a catch-22?\n\nSo many businesses we work with made decisions based on claims that all this money was going to be available for everybody. The original $349 billion was based on a mathematical equation that said this would cover all small businesses, and then it ran out in 13 days. Then it took another week before it got back up and running, and this second wave is going considerably slower. We had a lot of people who wouldn't have done what they did business-wise had they not believed this money was going to be available to them \u2014 keeping staff members employed when the businesses were shut down to go in and clean and renovate and set up the social distancing. They spent that money, and now they don't have the cash and they're not getting the PPP fund. A lot of decisions were made based on the belief that it was a benefit, and it's just not turning out to be that.\n\nRelated: Self-Employed With No Employees? You Can Still Get a PPP Loan\n\nSo should the mom-and-pop shop that received a $50,000 loan worry about whether they could be in legal trouble?\n\nI think the evaluation that businesses needs to do is: Can I afford to have a $50,000 loan on my books if this isn't forgiven? Let's go with the mom-and-pop restaurant. They're only going to be up and running at 25 percent capacity. They're not going to hit the payroll totals they need to for forgiveness, and they already operate on slim margins. So can they afford to have a $50,000 loan that has to be paid back in two years? Has this helped keep them open for two years and put a big debt on their books, or has this helped them stay in business and keep their people paid? Those are two very different questions.\n\nWas this ultimately a failure of imagination or never really intended to serve its stated purpose?\n\nThe optimist in me wants to say, when you look at the original CARES Act and the four corners of that document, it was a benefit. And it feels like every week, there's another shoe that drops. And somewhere between interim rules and the departments all doing their own analysis and implementing what they believe are the standards, it's definitely gone from what was a real benefit to the businesses to more of a burden. When this came out, I don't think they could have anticipated that come mid-May, we would still be looking at a lot of the [public-health] precautions still out there. When is the uptick of people going to restaurants? So I don't know that all this eight-week, keep people employed \u2014 it's just not enough. If there were a little leeway and [it was] not so rigid on, \"The day that you fund starts your clock\" ... It really should be the day you can go back into business operating at a capacity that can cover is when your clock starts ticking. If you read the act, that interpretation is there. The way that it read, it really looked like a good benefit, but I don't feel like it's panning out to be one.\n\nIf you personally owned a small business and received a modest loan, would you feel like it's more trouble than its worth or that it's the least the government can do and you'll find a way to maximize it?\n\nThere's a couple of things I'm looking at. One, if you're a mom-and-pop shop and don't have access to capital or liquidity and you're able to bring people back and open up your business, I'm not looking at it as the government owes me. I'm looking at it in this light: Am I keeping my business open for eight more weeks, and then I'm shutting it down? Or is this going to help me keep my business around for the next three, four, five years? If I'm answering this is a Band-Aid and I might have to pay some money back, I'm taking the loan for sure. The ability to get people back to working and keep good businesses that should be around open \u2014 I think the answer is it's worth taking. If you're only going to make it through those eight weeks and be out of money, I'm not sure it's the right decision for you.\n\nIs there any reason to assume the government might expand forgiveness?\n\nThey've already been stepping around this idea that we're going to see more guidance on forgiveness before this May 14 give-back, so after that comes out, if the money is still available, I wouldn't be shocked if we see another extension of that give-back period.\n\nIt's primarily larger companies returning loans, but do some of them have a legitimate claim to these funds?\n\nIf you look at the number of large businesses already anticipating bankruptcy, that tells you they're already needing money too, like J. Crew. The hard part was, when this came out, they said you don't need to prove you don't have other capital or that you can try to go to other resources. But now what they're saying is, if you have that, it's not necessary. So what's the difference between this and getting an [SBA] 7(a) loan, other than the forgiveness piece?\n\nBut if a business is resourceful enough to file for Chapter 11, perhaps that indicates they don't have the same need as a much smaller operation simply trying to keep doors open for a few more weeks.\n\nI agree with that. Those big businesses have teams of people that know how to go in and properly manage through a bankruptcy, and that's not available to a small business. They're just winging it and hoping for the best. Let's think about Ruth's Chris. They got annihilated, but you have to think that their counsel and CFO sat there and said, \"We qualify, and we did this properly. We didn't make this CARES Act. Why are we being told we aren't eligible?\" Just to play a little devil's advocate, they didn't really do anything wrong. Morally, perhaps they did, and they sleep with that burden at night. But when you go down the checkbox, they met the criteria. It's a tough environment, no matter what size business you are.\n\nRelated: Which Public Companies Have Returned Their SBA PP Loans?\n\nShould lenders bear any responsibility to guide small-business borrowers through this process of determining whether to keep their loan?\n\nThe lender is not going to. Lenders have basically taken the stance of, \"This is your company, this is your loan. Other than walking you through the process, we're taking no liability.\" I, on a personal stance, think if a lender is going to push through a loan, and if they've done their due diligence, they have a responsibility to make sure the loan is correct and accurate and the amount is an amount the company needs and is within the qualifications. That's their job. But it seems like that's been completely removed. Now, there's no personal guarantees, so maybe this is the way of holding the person getting the loan more responsible, but I do find it odd that there's no liability for the lenders at all. They're the middlemen.\n\nBottom line: How does a loan recipient make the calculation of whether their business has been proportionately impacted?\n\nI think you say to yourself: What's been the impact to me? For some people, that's going to be a loss of customers. For some people, that's going to be completely shutting down. For some people, that's going to be my employees aren't coming back because of unemployment. I don't think there's a one-shoe-fits-everybody. You have to look at: Where was my business headed prior to February 15, 2020, and am I on track with where I saw myself going and what the numbers told me? And if your answer is yes, then you have to ask yourself why. If you think about health supplements, any company that sells any kind of immunity vitamin is probably doing very well right now. I don't think you're going to qualify to say, \"I was really negatively impacted by this.\" But I think doctors were negatively impacted, because people haven't been going to the doctor like they should. As it keeps playing out, I don't think we're done seeing guidance, and I don't think the fight on forgiveness has stopped. There are some really good changes they can make that would turn this back in the right direction, so I keep my fingers crossed.", "author": ["Kenny Herzog"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/GhfHMzZ8F0A/350260", "published": "2020-05-08T17:00:00", "title": "Should You Microdose to Treat Depression?", "text": "May 8, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe following article is written by Ben Angel.

No matter what people might know or think they know about psychedelics, the 40-year moratorium that closed down related research in the '70s is now coming to an end. Psychiatrists are beginning to realize that strategic, supervised use of these psychopharmacological drugs is helping people with mental disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, depression and cluster headaches. Still, are there enough scientific studies to warrant the use of these drugs in mainstream society?\n\nI\u2019ll admit that talk of psychedelic therapy to treat depression makes me nervous. In researching my book, Unstoppable, I looked at other key triggers that can mimic psychological disorders like depression and anxiety, such as inflammation, nutritional deficiencies, hormonal changes, side effects from medications, gut imbalances and food sensitivities. The reality is, depression is complex. What works for one may not work for another. Any successful treatment must first identify the root cause of one\u2019s depression successfully, which can be a complex process if not done under the right medical care. A psychedelic treatment isn\u2019t suddenly going to fix a nutritional deficiency, for example, but it may help target other symptoms and behaviors that correspond with depression. This is why it was critical to set my own biases aside and speak to an expert.\n\nRelated: There Will Be 4 Identity Types in This Recovery. Which One Are You?\n\nImage credit for photo of Dr. Sportelli: Jen Vitale Photography\n\nI was fortunate enough to interview Dr. Domenick J. Sportelli, who is board-certified by the American Board of Neurology and Psychiatry for General Psychiatry and fellowship-trained and Board Certified in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. He also specializes in human behavior and psychopharmacology. I wanted to get the most current information on the use of psychedelics in treatment for depression, anxiety and PTSD, so I first asked him first to clarify what psychedelics were.\n\n\u201cThe term 'psychedelic substance' refers to an exogenous substance [derived outside the body] that, when taken into the body in various ways, physiologically, neurologically and psychologically manifest an internal personal experience of altered states of consciousness,\" he explains. \"This includes perceptual distortions, hallucinations, synesthesia [a mixing of the senses], altered sense of time and space, as well as potentially inducing what researchers call a 'mystical experience' \u2014 a sense of oneness, of noetic experience and an undefinable but profoundly spiritual quality.\u201d\n\nIs there enough evidence to support psychedelic therapy?\n\nSportelli wants to make clear that the most researched psychedelics \u2014 LSD, psilocybin (mushrooms), peyote, MDMA, DMT and ketamine \u2014 have different mechanisms of action and even induce subtle, subjective experiential differences. Although each is grouped under the term \u201cpsychedelics,\u201d they are quite disparate.\n\nDr. Sportelli is cautiously optimistic about the multitudes of large-scale, university-based testing and prior research compiled decades ago, but worries about the abiliity to circumvent bureaucracy and conduct safe, credible and substantial testing today. He does add that recent testing of psilocybin, LSD, ketamine and MDMA in particular has generated cause for optimism, and that they will likely have a place not only in continued, diverse research design and protocol, but eventually in therapeutic use.\n\nWhat types of depression can psychedelics treat?\n\nIf we were to look at the onset of most mental illnesses, the majority start to become evident between the ages of 11 and 24, according to the National Institute of Health. With only 42 percent of people getting treatment, most typically do not seek out assistance until a secondary mental illness occurs several years later.\n\nWhen asked how broadly psychedelics might be able to help treat people with depression, Sportelli concedes that, \u201cUnfortunately, research hasn\u2019t determined the level of scientific data to specify the type of depression or mood disorder that psychedelic therapy will benefit.\u201d But he does add that research and data are beginning to show statistically significant improvements in mood, reduced anxiety, change in positive personality traits over time, the possibility of reducing addictive behaviors, reduction in suicidal tendencies and increased personal insight.\n\nDo psychedelics treat the symptoms or the cause?\n\nAccording to Dr. Sportelli, depression stems from a mix of genetic, biological, neurological, psychological and sociological factors. Recent research has demonstrated how the chemical breakdown of psilocybins closely resembles that of serotonin, and indicated the promising interplay of select hormone transmission. Dr. Sportelli stresses the critical role that these drugs might offer in mood disorders is at the forefront of the pharmaceutical quest for treatment.\n\n\u201cWe have never seen substances like these that can potentially change the way that we look at our life and change perspective with lasting results,\" he says, noting that they might be able to help \"supercharge psychotherapy.\"\n\nIs this ultimately a recommend reatment, and where does one turn for it?\n\n\u201cAt this time, in the U.S., I would only recommend this treatment be a part of, and under the close supervision of, a university-based IRB [Institutional Review Board]-monitored clinical trial,\u201d Sportelli emphasizes. Before any psychiatric treatment, Dr. Sportelli also recommends a full medical and neurological evaluation to rule out any of the multitudes of medical circumstances that can manifest as a primary mood disorder, and reiterates that significant and often profoundly adverse outcomes associated with such powerful, mind-altering chemicals need to be weighed further as well. That\u2019s why, as part of any regulated trial, all the necessary medical workups would be completed before participation.\n\nIs the stigma around psychedelic therapy warranted?\n\nSportelli acknowledges that there is a safety concern associated with psychedelics, and does not condone their recreational or illict use. But he does believe that regulated clinical trials, judicious and ethical research methodology and the progression for therapeutic intervention should not be overlook based on previous stigma and possible misclassification.\n\nRelated: 50,000 Entrepreneurs Tell Us How to Avoid Stress and Anxiety\n\nI\u2019ve never been one to throw the baby out with the bathwater. After interviewing Dr. Sportelli, I hold hope for the future, but also a concern for those who may seek out this kind of treatment without an accurate medical diagnosis. My number-one hesitation remains \u2014 that is we simply do not have the studies to show which types of depression psychedelic therapy successfully treats, which may result in people attempting to use a hammer when in fact they need a nail.\n\nEither way, if you are to venture into this arena, find someone who specializes in it.

We are all being hit hard right now. Millions of people have been infected around the globe, hundreds of thousands have died. Many businesses that have been built with sweat and tears over decades are now left for ruin.\n\nMy business, Redline Steel, has been forced to pivot massively in order to survive the unexpected storm. But we\u2019ve been through challenging times before. Crisis, trials and setbacks have been unwanted friends of mine for as long as I can remember.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I truly believe that not only can a crisis define you \u2014 it can remake you.\n\nOn May 3rd, 2012, I was serving my third, tour in Afghanistan and working out in a gym when a 107-mm rocket exploded about three and a half feet from me. I barely remember the ensuing gunfire and the rescue, but I survived. Shrapnel went all the way through my leg, which led me to six months of physical therapy just so I could walk and move normally again. I had nerve damage in my back and required lumbar block fusion surgery.\n\nLess than 18 months after my injury in Afghanistan, I landed my first magazine cover on Ironman Australia. The gym almost killed me, but it also saved my life. A lot of people would have fear re-entering something that almost ended their life, but I was able to turn that negative experience into a positive career change for me.\n\nI want my failures, trials and painful moments of life to fuel me \u2014 not beat me.\n\nPain will not win\n\nThe rocket explosion is a part of my life, but it's something I don't dwell on it. I focus on what\u2019s ahead. I couldn\u2019t work out exactly like I used to, but I found workarounds. I had to change my workouts, but I didn\u2019t let that stop me. Instead, I let it fuel my motivation.\n\nWe cannot allow the world to tell us what we can and can't do. We have to decide this for ourselves.\n\nThat is central to overcoming nearly any obstacle, thus, it\u2019s been a core belief of mine for a long time.\n\nRedline started in a very similar way; with a setup disguised as a setback. I had a partnership that fell apart on the day we were supposed to sign. I had already invested thousands of dollars in attorney fees for the deal. But I pressed on anyway.\n\nIn the military, we call it \u201cCharlie Mike.\u201d We continue on the mission, and no matter what obstacle is thrown in my way, I find a way to work around it. I\u2019ve found that no matter what, if there\u2019s a will, there is a way.\n\nIn other words, I had to develop a will of steel.\n\nFocusing your energy\n\nWhen things are out of your control, stay focused on what you can do, not on what you can\u2019t do.\n\nSo what do you do when you have zero control? Because it\u2019s true \u2014 sometimes events take place beyond our control, just like what's happening right now on a global scale. No one expected that we would go into quarantine, that the economy would plummet or that we would rapidly descend into a recession.\n\nBut, again, this was nothing new for me. I\u2019d already experienced something similar just 18 months beforehand.\n\nIn November 2018, at the peak of buying season when retailers like mine make or break their year, I had a $70,000 piece of machinery that\u2019s central to my entire production line completely break down.\n\nIt was under warranty, but I didn\u2019t have a backup, and the parts had to be imported, which was going to take more than a month. We ordered another one and frantically worked on solutions, but the orders began to backlog.\n\nBreaking promises hurts the most\n\nWe had promised thousands of customers that we would get their orders out by Christmas. And although we did everything humanly possible, we couldn\u2019t meet the timeline for everyone. Customer complaints started to pile up as rapidly as my orders. I was called a fraud and other horrible names I\u2019d never been called, all while we were doing everything humanely possible to solve the issue.\n\nI was forced to cut off any new sales because we couldn\u2019t fulfill the thousands of orders we already had in a timely manner. This caused a massive budget crunch as the cash flow stopped. Fortunately, I had saved more than three months of operating expenses, but even with that, we were on the brink of bankruptcy. We were very, very close, and I had to pull every dollar I had out of savings to pay payroll and expenses just so we could stay open. I had to sell generators and plasma tables and whatever I could for $500, $1,000 and $2,000 at a time just to make ends meet.\n\nBlood is not always family, and family is not always blood\n\nI've learned that the true definition of family is when you'll do anything for anyone when it's the least convenient for you.\n\nTwo weeks before Christmas, 60 percent of my staff left. This left me crippled. Not only did I not have my main machine working, I lost most of my workforce.\n\nThere were nights when I was driving home late and thought, \u201cIf an 18-wheeler comes over into my lane, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll move.\u201d\n\nOne thing\u2019s certain: I\u2019d rather go through another rocket explosion than endure the six months of hell that crisis brought me.\n\nBut all was not lost. My remaining team showed me who I could really count on. They became my heroes. I learned to put my trust in the team that remained and to show up for them. I discovered who was really there for me when I needed them the most. The people who stayed believed in me; they believed in us. They encouraged me, continually reminding me that we\u2019d get through this.\n\nMy team is my greatest asset\n\nKeeping the core team I kept and losing the other 60 percent ended up becoming one of my greatest gifts. It showed me who has my back and gave me space to improve the rest of my team.\n\nSo fast-forward to the COVID-19 crisis hitting. While I didn\u2019t have to make staff cuts, I knew most of my team was on two-income households, so I decided to offer to cover all my staff\u2019s house payments for the month of April. That wasn\u2019t easy for me because we\u2019re not a venture-backed company sitting on loads of cash. But these people had been there for me, and I wanted to do what I could to be there for them.\n\nAdditionally, as a student of consumer behavior, I realized that Redline had to shift its entire marketing strategy. We don\u2019t sell critical-need products, so we needed to shift very fast and come up with a new strategy. Recently, some of the entrepreneurs I coach have been pivoting their marketing strategy to find the opportunity to great results so I know it\u2019s not just me getting lucky. The opportunity is still there, it\u2019s just moved.\n\nWe created a Give Back collection of 17 different products, where we offer a free gift to medical workers and other critical frontline responders who are bravely serving. In about a month, we\u2019ve given over $2 million in product away thanks to this strategy and acquired hundreds of thousands of new customers at an incredibly affordable customer acquisition rate.\n\nToday, I have a stronger staff and than ever before. We are protected by five layers of redundancy so if a machine like that ever breaks down again, we are covered. Plus, we were poised to grow faster and better than ever before. That wouldn\u2019t have happened without the crisis of November 2018.\n\nWith everything America is facing now, business owners need to get comfortable with the uncomfortable and start thinking outside the box. What was working for you before may not work for you now.\n\nNo one wants a crisis thrust upon them, but the benefit of a crisis is that you will find new limits. When I look at some of the most seasoned entrepreneurs, I see that they\u2019ve stepped outside their comfort zones so often and gone through so much in the past that they can bet on themselves to know that they\u2019ll make it through whatever they\u2019re facing.\n\nSome lasting lessons\n\n1. Get comfortable with the uncomfortable. When the market shifts, pivot rapidly.\n\n2. Never forget \u2014 whatever challenge you\u2019re facing can remake you better than ever.\n\nA quote I love by General Douglas MacArthur is \u201cAmericans never quit.\u201d I think that\u2019s as true and relevant for today as it was for any other point in history. It isn\u2019t the season to quit. It\u2019s the season to remake ourselves.\n\nSo keep going, my friend.

And with the increased need for communication in quarantine, that number is surely rising as we speak.\n\nThe Apple iMessage has come to dominate North America, with millions of blue bubbles sent back and forth every minute. On the other side of the globe, countries like China have apps like WeChat.\n\n, though, is by far the world\u2019s largest app, totaling 300 million daily users worldwide. WhatsApp added around 1.5 million people to its sphere after being acquired by Facebook in 2014 for $22 billion.\n\nSo what's a messaging app to do with a user base that just surpassed a 2-billion-user threshold? Advertising, of course.\n\nFacebook made headlines last year for floating the idea of introducing ads to WhatsApp, and then backed off to some extent. But in its quest to monetize the messaging giant, the company still has plans to integrate ads into WhatsApp\u2019s status feature.\n\nDialogues over the prospect has included the usual suspects: Privacy activists who detest the idea of adding ads, and targeted-ad fans who prefer personalized ads to sifting through advertising content on their own. There are also some who simply believe that successful apps, which serve users for free, have the right to choose their ideal business model in order to thrive.\n\nRelated: Why You Should Be Buying Facebook Ads Now\n\nSilicon Valley is thinking hard about user privacy\n\nIf WhatsApp was ever to incorporate ads on a large scale, the app would be opening its doors to third parties to whom it would be selling ad space, potentially lessening the data privacy WhatsApp users enjoy today.\n\nThose who genuinely value data privacy and fear the implications of opening the messaging giant to ads might jump ship, instead turning to alternative like Viber, which prides itself on its commitment to data privacy and security, and Wire, designed by Skype co-founder Janus Friis to be ultra-secure.\n\nWhatsApp Co-Founders Jason Koum and Brian Acton seem to fall on the side of privacy advocates. They have reportedly expressed concern that a commercial messaging feature would force WhatsApp to weaken its end-to-end encryption. And their concerns don\u2019t fall on deaf ears at Facebook\u2019s headquarters.\n\nBack in early 2019, Mark Zuckerberg floated a plan to shift Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram into one unified encrypted system, meaning only those who send and receive messages would be able to view them.\n\nThe idea was that the push for privacy online would leverage private messaging as the future of social networking, and Facebook rightly sought to get ahead of the trend. The challenge Facebook faces in its march toward a privacy-friendly, unified encrypted messaging system is that about 98 percent of the company\u2019s revenue comes from advertising, and it\u2019s not easy to advertise on such a platform while maintaining a commitment to privacy.\n\nRelated: WhatsApp Pay To Fully Launch In India Soon: Mark Zuckerberg\n\nWhatsApp already collects our metadata\n\nSome industry experts argue, though, that since WhatsApp already collects metadata today, introducing targeted advertising based on that information wouldn\u2019t be such a huge leap.\n\n\u201cI do not think that we will have a major difference in privacy on WhatsApp since it already collects data,\u201d says Omri Argaman, CMO of marketing technology firm Zoomd. \u201cWhatsApp already does cross-data sharing with Facebook. Someone who sends a WhatsApp message to a new contact, for example, will receive a friend recommendation on Facebook within less than 30 minutes. At the end of the day, the data is already collected in the first place such as with many other popular platforms. Ads might be an issue for usability, but for privacy? Not at all.\u201d\n\nAds probably won't be WhatsApp's demise\n\nThose who would choose to stay aboard a WhatsApp ship heading to the land of advertisements (let\u2019s be real, probably most everyone) value the continuity, familiarity, and efficiency of WhatsApp.\n\nJust as few Facebook users left the platform when it introduced ads back in 2007, targeted ads likely wouldn\u2019t be WhatsApp\u2019s downfall. This is good news for advertisers and publishers wanting to broadcast their ads across the screen, as well as users who enjoy the efficiency targeted ads offer.\n\nWe will see whether Facebook incorporates ads to WhatsApp\u2019s status feature, and whether that opens the door to additional targeted ads in the future.

I\u2019ve personally been stunned by the impact of an online community from my own experience. My online Facebook community, Elites Mastermind, has over 85,000 members who unite on a daily basis to discuss ecommerce tips and strategies.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips for Building an Online Community for Your Business\n\nThe impacts are significant. I created my Facebook group to build a virtual community and offer tips, but there are also sales advantages: The University of Michigan found that customers spend 19 percent more after joining a company\u2019s online community. Thanks to this, and the massive potential for consistent engagement, 74 percent of large companies have created online communities, according to research from Demand Metric. For me, however, it\u2019s about amplifying impact. I believe that anyone who has something to say can create an online community of like-minded entrepreneurs and unite them over a common cause. Here\u2019s how to do so, based on my own experience of what works.\n\n1. Share knowledge for free.\n\nThe core element of our group is sharing information at no cost. These tips cover Shopify, Facebook ads, social media marketing, product sourcing, traffic generation and more. Think about the commonalities among all the members of your group. What are individuals joining the community to learn? What interests them most? What are they hoping to accomplish? From there, create the content you know they want to know. Seventy-three percent of consumers report that they trust a brand when they deliver good quality products and services, according to research by Edelman. This extends beyond what you sell as a brand into what you give the consumer consistently. Quality advice, how-to\u2019s and pieces of value within your community develop trust.\n\nPart of this comes down to defining your niche. Generic entrepreneurship communities can work in theory, but they need strong branding and a strong sense of community to bring all of the individuals together. What aspect of entrepreneurship do you want to unite based on?\n\nRelated: 5 Examples Your Brand Can Follow to Build an Online Community\n\n2. Rely on word of mouth.\n\nI\u2019m often asked if I used paid ads to grow my Facebook community, but the honest answer is that all of it was word-of-mouth marketing. This, too, comes back to sharing value. Think about it: If you were part of a community that was sharing endless value, wouldn\u2019t you share it with a friend? At the very least it might come up in a conversation on business strategies, or you may quote the community in a podcast, article or blog post. Ultimately, this word-of-mouth marketing is stronger for your brand than paid ads, because 92 percent of consumers say they trust recommendations from friends and family over any type of advertising, according to Nielsen research. Give your community members something to rave about to their own communities.\n\nWhen just getting started, don\u2019t deny the power of your own word of mouth marketing. You\u2019ve likely established some trust with a few social media followers, friends or family members. Tell them what your community seeks to do and what you\u2019ll share \u2014 this will get the first batch of members in the door.\n\nRelated: 7 Strategies for Achieving Phenomenal Online Community Growth\n\n3. Engage frequently.\n\nCommunities aren\u2019t worth doing if they aren\u2019t supported consistently. Engage frequently \u2014 if not daily, every other day \u2014 because you will become the heartbeat that keeps the community going. Go into your group for a live video, host an \u201cask me anything,\u201d or even facilitate in-person events to build a sense of community. As membership grows and many start posting on their own, more activity will build. But stepping out and letting the members run the show can convey that you don\u2019t care. You also will miss out on a massive opportunity to establish thought leadership within your community.\n\nIt comes down to empowerment, too. Engagement encourages more participation. Every like and comment on a post makes the poster feel that they should share more.\n\nRelated: How to Create Community Among Your Customers\n\n4. Share in other groups as well.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to think of community as something that extends beyond the walls of your Facebook group. I consistently show up in other Facebook groups to share value, because a key part of community building is building relationships outside of the community you already have. The way I see it, everyone benefits: Those who I connect with can then join my community and share their unique perspective and expertise with the group. This is how grow continually and deliver value consistently.\n\nRelated: 3 Ways to Build an Online Community That's All About Your Prospects", "author": ["Steve Tan"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/PQHMZ3x1VlI/349667", "published": "2020-05-07T16:30:00", "title": "4 Ways Solopreneurs Can Strengthen Their Businesses", "text": "May 7, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nBusiness is hurting across the globe. Supply chains have been disrupted. People are staying home. Many businesses that rely on traditional sources of revenue are not able to stay open. For solopreneurs, the pain can be even more acute.\n\nRecessions traditionally impact small businesses disproportionately, as we saw in 2008, when they accounted for 45 percent of employment but 62 percent of jobs lost. And it\u2019s even worse for businesses with under 10 employees or young businesses period. Solopreneurs almost always fall into one of these categories and often both. And this current downturn seems to be following a similar trend, with nearly 80 percent of small businesses negatively impacted. Fifty-four percent have dealt with slower . No matter your sector, you\u2019re probably going to be dealing with fallout, but there is hope, and there are ways that solopreneurs can still thrive.\n\nCut your marketing back as little as possible \u2014 grow it if you can\n\nWhen a recession hits and money gets tight, many companies decide to cut back wherever they can. Marketing and advertising tend to get hit hard. But did you realize that you might actually be hurting yourself long-term by cutting back your spend?\n\nAs Moz founder Rand Fishkin notes, \u201cDon\u2019t use a sledgehammer, use a scalpel.\u201d Businesses that lower ad spend during a recession tend to see sales fall 20 to 30 percent over the next two years.\n\nMarketing and advertising are the low-hanging fruit if you\u2019re going to tighten your belt, but do it with the mindset of pruning for new growth, not that of a drowning man clinging to a life preserver.\n\nSome studies even suggest that a soft economy may be the best time for businesses to grow their market share. If you\u2019re cutting back while your competitors are pushing ahead, you might lose out once the economy gets back on better footing.\n\nRelated: How to Maximize Your Startup\u2019s Content Marketing Budget\n\nConnect the physical with the digital\n\nSolopreneurs with physical businesses are having a particularly hard time right now as everybody has to stay indoors, but some have been able to pivot by bringing their offering online \u2014 or as online as they can.\n\nKajabi\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Build Together\u201d campaign has been collecting stories from its users, and many of them deal with exactly this. For example, dog-training expert Connie Cleveland does 12 live events each year and hosts a two-day live workshop. That part of her business has completely collapsed, but after a recent event was cancelled, she reached out to everyone who had signed up and offered them a month of free membership for her online training business, The Obedience Road.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of people who took me up on that, which is great,\" says Cleveland. \"A month from now, they may drop off or they may not, but at least I got them into the membership site, where they\u2019ll get to know me and what I offer.\u201d\n\nRestaurants that never offered carryout or online ordering are now doing full online rollouts. Physical trainers are doing seminars from their home gyms. The advantage of being a is that you\u2019re more nimble than most businesses. Take advantage of it.\n\nFind a pain point and address it \u2014 immediately\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of Warby Parker. The company that put direct-to-consumer eyeglasses on the map didn\u2019t start in good economic times \u2014 it actually started during a recession.\n\nCo-founder Dave Gilboa had to buy a new smartphone and a new pair of glasses around the same time and wondered why the glasses cost so much more than the phone. That thought coalesced into what became Warby Parker, and the rest is history, as they say.\n\nWhy did it succeed? The company provided a product people wanted at a cost below what anyone else could offer. No one to that point had been providing stylish eyeglasses for the price Warby Parker could. While money was tighter, this had a lot of appeal, and it proved resilient when the economy got back on track.\n\nCompanies like Coding Dojo, Stellari and Digital Ocean are pivoting to providing products and services that are required in present circumstances. Some fashion companies are repurposing material to create masks and other PPE, while other tech brands are providing support and free services for hard-hit businesses.\n\nWhen money gets tight and customers are in short supply, you can build a loyal audience by providing real value and helping people. That\u2019s true at any time, but doubly so now.\n\nRelated: Want to Build Better Products? Own Your Customers\u2019 Pain\n\nBe genuinely helpful\n\nCompanies that throw themselves into helping their communities and genuinely aiding people will reap the benefits, whereas a tone-deaf or selfish response will turn them off. The most important thing is to focus on genuine, authentic help first. Be altruistic. The business benefits will follow. Even if it seems like you\u2019re losing out in the short-term, you\u2019ll build relationships, appreciation and customers that will last far beyond this moment.\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest takeaway from this for solopreneurs: Find ways to stay in business, but make sure you\u2019re providing a benefit that people can really use even while cooped up in their houses or dealing with sickness.

What I\u2019ve learned through each launch strategy and execution process is how important it is to be creative. If you're part of a community of , it's likely that someone is launching something on any given day. As exciting as that is to be part of, it can also be a challenge to stand out from the noise and complete your launch in a way that\u2019s specific to your personal brand and the brand of whatever it is that you\u2019re launching.\n\nRelated: This Creative Production Company Launched Almost 25 Years Ago. Its Ability to Evolve With the Market Kept It in Business.\n\nHere are some creative ideas that I\u2019ve put to the test in my own digital launches (specifically, the launch of my false lash line last year that did quite well) that can help you start thinking outside the box about your own upcoming launch. Remember: The more creative and unique you are in your launch strategy, the more eyeballs your launch will get.\n\n1. Unite with ambassadors to share the launch for you\n\nI firmly believe in \u201cgo big or go home.\u201d I\u2019ve had many launches where it felt like I was shouting into the void with just one post across all my social channels, and when I launched my lash company, I just didn\u2019t want it to be like that. So, I gathered a group of lash ambassadors: people who represented my \u201ctarget market\u201d (in this case, makeup and false lash lovers) who could partake in the launch with me. I sent them two pairs of free lashes, asked them to take photos with the glitter lash box and wearing the lashes, and we all posted at the very same time.\n\nRelated: Learn Graphic Design and Launch Your Own Business\n\nIn addition to the added exposure (and the fun!), it was a chance to see my product in all of its diversity. Each of your ambassadors will use or embrace your product a little differently, and seeing everyone\u2019s creative take together creates a full picture of what your product can do. Given, this was a bit easier for me because it was a product that could be worn, but the same principle applies if you\u2019re launching a book or a program. Can you first do a mini launch on a small beta group and give them your product for free in exchange for their inclusion in your concerted launch efforts? The more you give them creative reign over their posts here, the better.\n\n2. Creative, bold digital assets\n\nIn a digital launch, the more creative you can be with your fonts, color scheme, social media posts and landing page, the better. I was recently talking with Layla Parr, the founder of the Launch Societe, a company that focuses specifically on launches. I loved her language about what she helps female founders do: \u201cCombine her warring energies into a harmonious launch.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m certainly not a graphic designer, but I have been able to create the digital assets for each of my launches. Parr told me that her best advice is to \u201creach for the highest vision for what you want the launch to feel like, then find fonts and colors that can imitate that same feel.\u201d That stuck with me.\n\nRelated: Learn How to Start a Creative Side Hustle as a Photographer\n\nI spent a great deal of time perusing online resources like Creative Market to find fonts that matched my expression. This exploration is important \u2014 I urge you to not just go for the status quo fonts and templates. Make a splash! The bolder the digital assets, the higher the chance that one of your followers will actually pause their mindless scrolling to look at what you\u2019re launching.\n\n3. Make a fun countdown\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your digital assets, create some suspense before you launch. I didn\u2019t tell anyone outside my ambassador group and close friends that I was about to launch my line of lashes. To drum up interest, I posted faded images of me wearing my product in a non-obvious way with the overlaid numbers of \u201c3,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d and then \u201c1\u201d leading up to the launch day. I put the date of the launch in the caption, too. This suspense creates a sense of investment for your audience. The more they can wonder about what's coming and feel excited about it, the more momentous your launch will feel.\n\n4. Host a giveaway\n\nFinally, a few weeks after the launch, consider hosting a giveaway on your social channels to stir up enthusiasm again. Give away anywhere from one to five of your products or seats in your upcoming course, and ask followers to enter by tagging friends and liking the photo. This will enhance your product\u2019s visibility even more. I also found that doing this giveaway was a great way to engage audience members who weren\u2019t initially interested in my product or service in the heat of the launch but would be interested in trying it for free if they won the giveaway. This way, you don\u2019t lose or delay any purchases from people who were going to buy to begin with. It just reignites enthusiasm in the \"middle tier\" of your audience members who need an extra push to invest in your product.\n\nTry these ideas out for yourself, or put your own spin on them. Digital launches are my favorite because there are no boundaries to how creative you can be. Show the world what you\u2019re made of, and make them pay attention. Your launch deserves it.\n\nRelated: 3 Memorable Ways to Launch a Product to Wow Customers", "author": ["Haley Hoffman Smith"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/SQyV6UD4RqI/349969", "published": "2020-05-06T15:30:00", "title": "5 Ways Brands Can Reinvent Their Digital Marketing Strategy", "text": "May 6, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWe are all doing our best to cope under the current circumstances, and I believe that within adversity lies an opportunity to change, evolve and adapt.\n\nWhether you\u2019re an individual, entrepreneur or brand, the need of the hour is to reassess, rethink and reinvent your approach. While influencers, billionaires and corporations are joining hands to aid those in need, brands need to sustain business activities and simultaneously make a positive contribution to those around them.\n\nI recently spoke with brand strategist Alex McCurry, founder of Astra Media, which is helping businesses, brands and entrepreneurs reinvent their digital marketing strategy. Our conversation inspied me to share the following five ways in which brands can rethink their online strategy and make relevant offerings as we all turn our focus toward .\n\nGo Digital\n\nWith people spending much more time on social media platforms than ever before, brands need to shift focus to their digital operations and look for effective ways to connect, interact and transact with their audience. McCurry says that several brands and large brick-and-mortar retailers are now looking to strengthen their digital presence to sustain operations, be it by leveraging ecommerce or offering special incentives.\n\n\u201cI think companies are beginning to understand the importance of social media and digital presence,\" he argues. \"I think it\u2019s only a matter of time until even the most stubborn executives begin to see the value of these digital tools.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Ecommerce Companies Can Continue Engaging New Customers\n\nBe Compassionate\n\nNow is the time when we must do all we can to help each other. For brands, it is a unique opportunity to think outside the box and create innovative ideas that enable them to come forward and make a difference. \u201cBeing greedy or calloused during times of strife can be suicidal for companies,\" McCurry cautions. \"On the other hand, showing a level of compassion and selflessness can help build long-term customer loyalty.\u201d\n\nAn example that comes to mind is how Bacardi shifted production to supply methanol and help manufacture hand sanitizers. Bacardi has a massive presence online and launched a campaign dubbed #raiseyourspirits, which raised $3 million to support local bars and restaurants who were suffering due to the outbreak.\n\n\n\nRethink Offerings\n\nDuring a global health crisis, there are bound to be rapid changes in both consumer behavior and market dynamics. It is essential to monitor brand communication at all times and quickly adapt to changing circumstances. McCurry points to how Dyson is considering a shift in production to create 15,000 ventilators to help the UK\u2019s Nation Health Service and cope with the pandemic.\n\n\u201cBeing timely and understanding the importance of how market conditions and other changes can affect the relevancy of your product is imperative,\" he says. \"Remaining relevant and self-aware of your product can often determine whether you succeed or not during times like this.\u201d\n\nDyson kept tabs on the situation and chose to make a significant alteration in their line of production. Rather than marketing hairdryers and vacuum cleaners, they decided to change their stance by providing much needed medical equipment, ultimately saving lives.\n\nSupport a Cause\n\nThough business may be slow at the moment, it offers brands the opportunity to reach out to their audience online and initiate new and meaningful conversations. You must understand what customers expect from you as a brand and how it can be delivered.\n\nMcCurry shares an interesting example: Kenneth Cole decided to donate 20 percent of all its online sales to the Solidarity Response Fund created by the World Health Organization. Since everyone is holed up at home, leading gyms and fitness studios are offering free at-home workouts along with video-based guides and tutorials for exercises.\n\n\u201cPeople like to be affiliated with projects that they think are making a difference,\" McMurry reasons. \"The power of philanthropy and social entrepreneurship is huge, as it dramatically increases a consumer's confidence in your brand.\u201d\n\nSolve Pertinent Issues\n\nIt is essential to communicate often and effectively how your brand is helping consumers face challenges. \u201cAll of the compassion and lip service in the world is meaningless without action,\" states McCurry. \"By providing real, tangible solutions, it shows consumers that you truly practice what you preach.\u201d\n\nAs examples, think of how restaurants are now providing customers no-contact doorstep delivery or the way big-box stores like Walmart have allocated special hours for senior citizens, ensuring they can stock up on essentials without any risk.\n\nRelated: The 3 Most Valuable Things Entrepreneurs Can Be Doing for Their Team Right Now\n\n\n\nIn my own experience, sometimes a brand needs to stop thinking about statistics, revenue and returns and start thinking of genuine ways to add value and alleviate current stresses.

Apart from that, however, there are quite a few differences that make marketing a service business more complicated and difficult.\n\nFor one, you can't mass-produce services like you can with products, and the customer\u2019s input is much more pronounced. An uncooperative customer can degrade service quality significantly, unlike products which you can design to be fool-proof. Nonetheless, marketing is a crucial part of success in any service industry and you must get it right. Here are a few tips to do just that:\n\nDifferentiation for initial awareness\n\nUnlike with products where there will be reviews and even the most minute differences will be highlighted to place rank one product over another, most service businesses are similar in what they deliver. So to break into a market, you\u2019ll need to identify one area to center your unique selling proposition around.\n\nIt could be lower pricing, faster turnaround time, or specialization, but there must be something that will make customers consider moving to your service as opposed to the more established firms. After they hire you, you can help them see other ways your service is better, but that initial differentiation is key to landing new customers.\n\nRene Langer, CEO of PICKHVAC \u2014 which developed an online tool to connect contractors and clients \u2014 says that, \u201cWhen trying to establish your presence through pricing, it\u2019s important to be cautious in your approach. Too aggressive and you\u2019ll find yourself relegated to the low-end of the market with razor thin margins, while if you don\u2019t go low enough, you might not be able to turn enough heads to give your business the critical mass it needs. It\u2019s better to focus more on value than on price per se. Use incentives and bundles to make customers understand they\u2019ll get better bang for their buck with you.\"\n\nRelated: 3 Content Marketing Tips for Your Service Business\n\nStellar customer service to gain referrals\n\nNowadays, customer service is one of the most important considerations for any service-oriented business. It\u2019s also a crucial factor in how likely your customers are to refer their friends and family, so getting it right must be a focal point of your marketing efforts.\n\nThe first step is to train your staff extensively to be sure they understand the value of exceptional customer service and how to provide it. Many customers will not bother to report, but bad customer service from any of your staff will leave them determined to stay away from your business in the future. Apart from training, providing great customer support is essential, even after a service has been concluded.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to go overboard though \u2013 you do not want to become that person who is always sending spammy emails and eventually gets blocked. Instead, reach out occasionally with valuable information related to your service. That way, you\u2019ll keep your business top of mind and also ensure that you\u2019re leaving a positive impression for the next time a former client needs the services you provide.\n\nRelated: Video Marketing for Service Businesses\n\nNimble marketing\n\nYour competitors are not going to be sitting still while you come in and take all the customers. It\u2019s likely that over time, they are going to be switching things up as well, especially because service business\u2019 brands are more flexible than product brands.\n\nAnd flexibility is a point in your favor, if you harness it correctly. Be sure to keep an eye on your marketing metrics to see what\u2019s working and what needs to be changed, and it\u2019s crucial to have your social media monitoring in good hands as well so you can respond quickly and appropriately whenever something comes up on social media. If handled astutely, positive or negative feedback can be turned into good publicity for your brand.\n\nOn the whole, marketing a service business is complicated. But when done properly you can come into a market, stake your position, and increase your market share over time.\n\nRelated: 6 Ways Service-Based Businesses Can Market on Instagram", "author": ["Pritom Das"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/eMkRSSyBMic/349932", "published": "2020-05-01T12:00:00", "title": "Make Your Branding and Marketing Content Pop with This Easy-to-Use $30 Digital Illustrator", "text": "May 1, 2020 2 min read\n\nDisclosure: Our goal is to feature products and services that we think you'll find interesting and useful.

Bly\u2019s The Content Marketing Handbook. Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble\n\nMost marketers I know who use landing pages to make direct sales online focus on conversion: getting as many visitors as possible to the landing page to place orders.\n\nOther internet marketers, when writing landing page copy, focus not only on conversion but also on search engine optimization: keyword selection and meta tag creation that can increase traffic by raising the site\u2019s search engine rankings.\n\nBut in addition to all this, savvy online marketers are concerned with a third performance metric: capturing email addresses. If you have a 2 percent conversion rate, then for every 100 visitors to the landing page, only two buy. What happens to the other 98 visitors? You won\u2019t be able to add their email addresses to your list unless you incorporate a deliberate methodology into your landing page to capture them.\n\nHere are five methods for capturing the email addresses of landing page visitors who don\u2019t purchase. Every landing page you operate should use at least one.\n\n1. Ezine Sign-Up Box\n\nThis is a box where visitors can get a free enewsletter subscription just by entering their name and email address. The ezine sign-up box placed prominently on the first screen is a widely used method of email capture for websites, but it\u2019s less commonly used for microsites and landing pages. That\u2019s because if your headline and lead properly engage the visitor\u2019s attention, they won\u2019t bother to sign up\u2014they\u2019ll just start reading. Then, if they lose interest or reach the end but don\u2019t order, and instead click away, you haven\u2019t captured their email address.\n\n2. Squeeze Page\n\nAlso known as a preview page, squeeze pages are short landing pages that require visitors to register with their name and email address before they\u2019re allowed to go on and read the long-copy landing page.\n\nIn some cases, the long-copy landing page itself is positioned as a \u201creport\u201d that visitors can read after registering. For this to work, your landing page must be written in an informative, educational style. Many squeeze pages offer a content premium, such as a free report, just for submitting your email address. Those seeking to capture snail mail as well as email addresses make the premium a physical object that must be shipped, such as a free CD.\n\nSqueeze pages work well when your primary source of traffic is organic and paid search. That\u2019s because search visitors arriving at your site are only mildly qualified\u2014they\u2019ve decided to visit based on only a few words in a search engine description or paid Google ad. Therefore, they may not be inclined to read a lot of copy from an unfamiliar source. A squeeze page lets them absorb the gist of your proposition in a few concise paragraphs.\n\nThe main advantage of the squeeze page is that it ensures you capture an email address from every visitor who reads the full landing page. In addition, they\u2019ve been pre-qualified, in terms of their interest in the subject, and are more likely to read through the long copy.\n\n3. Email Capture Sidebar\n\nThese are forms built into the main landing page as sidebars, again making a free offer. In a long-copy landing page, the email capture sidebar usually appears early, typically on the second or third screen, and may be repeated one or more times throughout the page.\n\nThe drawback of the email capture sidebar is that the prospect sees it before they get too far in the sales letter, and therefore before you\u2019ve finished selling them and asked for the order. So, the risk is that if your product teaches, say, how to speak French, and the email capture sidebar offers a free French lesson, the visitor will just take the free offer instead of spending money on the paid offer.\n\n4. Pop-Under\n\nWhen you attempt to click away from the landing page without making a purchase, a window appears that says something like, \u201cWait! Don\u2019t leave yet without claiming your free bonus gift.\u201d\n\nThe advantage of the pop-under is that visitors see it only after they\u2019ve read to the point where they\u2019re leaving without ordering and the free content offer doesn\u2019t compete with or distract visitors from the paid product offer. The disadvantage is that about 25 percent of U.S. internet users run pop-up blockers on their devices, and many of these blockers will prevent your pop-under from showing.\n\n5. Floater\n\nA floater looks and functions much like a pop-up window, but it\u2019s actually part of the landing page\u2019s HTML code, and therefore won\u2019t be blocked by a pop-up blocker. The floater blocks a portion of the landing page when you click onto the site. You can enter your email or click the floater. Either action removes the floater and allows you to see the complete landing page.\n\nAs you can see, all these email capture methods offer some sort of free content \u2014 typically a downloadable PDF report, an ecourse delivered via auto-responder, or an ezine subscription \u2014 in exchange for your email address. But be warned: The ever-changing Google algorithm penalizes sites with floaters because, until you click out of them, they block the homepage.\n\nWhy bother to maximize the capture of visitor email addresses on your websites? First, by sending an online conversion series \u2014 a sequence of emails delivered by auto-responder \u2014 to these visitors, you\u2019ll have another opportunity to persuade them to buy. Second, the best names for your email marketing efforts are on your house elist. The faster you can build a large elist, the more profitable your internet marketing ventures will become.", "author": ["Robert W.

Most likely, they\u2019re looking for just one or two paragraphs that speak directly to their need. We find that a lot of users scan a webpage to determine whether it\u2019s worth reading, or simply to find the piece of information they\u2019re looking for.\n\nOf course, I believe in creating carefully crafted content. But that\u2019s not enough to optimize readibility. I have strong beliefs on how information is best digested, and below are some secrets that have served me well.\n\nLists\n\nBoth readers and search engines love lists. You often see rich snippets of lists appear in the top positions on search engines. Lists can be numbered or bulleted. Numbered lists help readers to quickly grasp the content you're presenting in terms of \"best to worst\" or \"first to last.\" Bulleted content enables the reader to see a concise summary, with the option to read on further for more details. Here\u2019s an example:\n\nMost important readability features:\n\nLarge fonts Adequate spacing Headers Tables Lists Graphs\n\nGraphs and Charts\n\nCreate a bar or line graph, or a pie chart, to highlight the most critical statistics provided in your content. Graphs and charts are essential when comparing things conceptually, or through time frames. Use color to make them stand out. Also, be sure to claim yourself as the source so that when other websites use it, you get a valuable backlink.\n\nRelated: Use These Web Design Tricks to Grow Your Business Exponentially\n\nTables\n\nBreaking down your content into a table helps readers understand complex information with just a glance. Tables are tricky on mobile devices, though, so you might need to adapt them. You can either include fewer columns (four or fewer) so the full table displays in responsive mode, or choose horizontal scrolling of the table content.\n\nRelated: 10 Tips for Web Design That Drives Sales\n\nMobile compatibility\n\nIf you regularly check Google Analytics or another website reporting service, you\u2019ve no doubt witnessed that more and more people visiting your website are doing so from a mobile device. As of last year, we are actually getting more traffic from mobile phones than from desktop computers. Yet many websites still have serious flaws when displayed on mobile.\n\nA responsive website will detect the screen size it\u2019s viewed on, and adjust the styling of the page accordingly. This ensures that the majority of your website will look good on mobile devices without having to make any adjustments.\n\nExample of a mobile-friendly and a not-mobile-friendly website:\n\nSections\n\nWithout proper sections, information can get buried, and you will lose visitors before they read more than two lines of content.\n\nWhen you\u2019re building a page or blog post that offers a large amount of information about a certain topic, you\u2019ll want to divide that information up using headers, spacing, and sections that ensure that your webpage is easy to scan.\n\nHeaders have been an on-page ranking factor in organic search results from the beginning. They help both search engine crawlers and readers better understand your content.\n\nThe proper use of headers will make a webpage with any amount of content more digestible and easier to read. If you don\u2019t use headers, or don\u2019t use them correctly, you\u2019ll experience higher bounce rates (when users exit your page shortly after arriving, with little or no interaction).\n\nAvoid content that reads like a medical journal. Ideally, you want to go for content sections that look similar to those in gossip magazines.\n\nBonus secret: Put in the time\n\nWhen creating web content, put yourself in the reader\u2019s shoes. Invest the extra time to ensure that your content is both readable and broken up into sections. Great content answers questions and educates the reader, quickly. If you are having trouble breaking down content into digestible pieces, keep trying. Great content takes time to create but lasts forever.\n\nRelated: The 5 Best Website Builders for Entrepreneurs -- and Which to Use ...", "author": ["Brian Greenberg"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/brWGXsJ6SDM/349870", "published": "2020-04-29T12:00:00", "title": "Need Help Telling Your Startup Story?

On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSa.L) cut its payout for the first time since World War Two as part of a plan to save $30 billion to help it weather an unprecedented decline in oil demand.\n\nYet some managers of divided funds - which seek to give their clients exposure to a steady stream of income - believe the beaten-down sector may hold companies that are likely to keep their dividends intact and see their share prices rise. The sector has rebounded 28.5% from its March lows, compared with 26.3% for the S&P 500.\n\n\u201cThe initial moves were very emotionally based and now we\u2019re getting back to fundamentals,\u201d said Scott Davis, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments who oversees $24 billion in income strategies. \u201cThere is still going to be volatility but we think you can pick your spots.\u201d\n\nDavis has recently added to positions such as Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) that have attractive free cash flows despite being in industries that have been among the hardest-hit by the slowdown. Both companies offer a dividend yield of approximately 2.5%.\n\nCompanies like Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Home Depot that have free cash flow growth above 6% will likely be able to invest and grow their market shares during a recession, while those such as Macy\u2019s Inc (M.N) could end up in bankruptcy, he said.\n\n\u201cI have a feeling that some of those trends that were already in play will only get accelerated,\u201d said Davis.\n\nU.K. and European companies will likely cut dividends more than their U.S. counterparts, which are more likely to reduce share buybacks first, said Mark Peden, investment manager, Equities, at Kames Capital.\n\nCompanies like cruise line operator Carnival Corp (CCL.N) and British retailer Marks and Spencer Group PLC (MKS.L) likely will not restore their dividends to previous levels, but other companies will want to increase theirs as early as possible to demonstrate their financial health, he said.\n\nWhile dividend-paying stocks may provide the cushion of a payout, their dividends - and share prices - could be in jeopardy if a subsequent wave of the virus deals another blow to growth by forcing countries to reinstate or extend lockdown measures.\n\nAnalysts at BofA Global Research urged investors to focus on companies whose dividends are likely to be secure, rather than comparatively rich.\n\n\u201cThe massive economic disruption brought on by COVID-19 questions the sustainability of dividends,\u201d the bank\u2019s analysts wrote.\n\nAt the same time, historically low borrowing costs have prompted many companies without strong balance sheets to initiate dividends since the end of the 2008 financial crisis, noted Linda Bakhshian, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes.\n\nWhile many of those companies will be forced to cut their dividends, cash-rich firms in growing sectors like healthcare and technology are the most likely to maintain or even increase their payouts through what could be a painful recession ahead, she said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see soon which companies are going to come out of this on the other side stronger,\u201d she said.", "author": ["David Randall", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/0gOIp8voe6I/your-unemployment-questions-answered-idUSKBN22C37G", "published": "2020-04-30T17:16:13", "title": "Your unemployment questions, answered", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. jobless claims have exceeded 30 million since the coronavirus outbreak hit the country, wiping out a decade of job gains and sending many Americans scrambling to find work and cash in on government aid.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A person walks by the entrance of the New York State Department of Labor offices, which closed to the public due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, U.S., March 20, 2020.

Remember that benefits are backdated, so if approved, you\u2019ll get back unemployment from the date you applied. In the meantime, can you ask for forbearance in credit card payments, car notes, or your mortgage or rent? Can you use your stimulus check, or, if necessary, emergency savings or low-interest credit cards to bridge the gap?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Janet Alvarez, executive editor of Wise Bread\n\nWhat are the best resources available to laid-off workers?\n\n\u201cThe best resources are the ones you ask for. Many people get overwhelmed and stuck, and feel bad about asking for help. Right now, get on the phone with everyone you owe and ask what help is available.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Beth Pinsker, Reuters journalist and a certified financial planner\n\nWhat tips do you have for anyone who is having trouble paying their bills (mortgage, rent, student loans, auto and credit, etc.) right now?\n\n\u201cIf possible, work with creditors directly. Landlords are aware that a tenant that is paying partial rent is better than no tenant at all. Negotiate as best you can, we\u2019re all in the same boat.\u201d\n\n\u2014Patrick Gourley, assistant professor of economics at University of New Haven\n\nHow can laid-off workers make the best use of their time in terms of training and upskilling? Is there anything else they should be doing?\n\n\u201cThis can be your moment to refine, expand, or even discover talents and skills. Perhaps an online class (many are free), guidance from a business coach, jumping back into that passion you put on hold or using this time to rest and recharge.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jody Thompson, co-creator of the Results-Only Work Environment\n\nWhere should unemployed workers turn for healthcare coverage? Do you advise using COBRA or can they get a better deal elsewhere?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll likely have better deals than COBRA at NY State of Health. Sign up for Medicaid, Essential Plan, Qualified Health Plans depending on income and other factors.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The Legal Aid Society (New York)\n\nWhat financial moves should employees who have been furloughed or experienced salary cuts in recent weeks make now?\n\n\u201cWork sharing is a win-win for employers and employees \u2013 employers get to retain trained workers and workers can work and get unemployment insurance benefits, plus the $600. Ask your boss about work sharing as an alternative to layoffs.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michele Evermore, senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project\n\nWhat benefits are available to contractors or gig-economy workers who have seen their salaries disappear?\n\n\u201cContractors, check with your state to see if they\u2019ve extended benefits. States like Oregon and others have expanded benefits to include contractors and gig workers. California also approved contractors to receive benefits through pandemic unemployment assistance.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Raymond Lee, founder and chief executive of Careerminds\n\nAny guidance on looking for a job?\n\n\u201cLean on your network.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\n\nRest assured there are options, even if they are all expensive.\n\nIf you are losing a workplace plan, you will get paperwork explaining your benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, known as COBRA, which allows you to continue on your same plan. The catch is that you have to pay the full amount of the premiums, not just the employee portion.\n\n\u201cThe employer was typically paying 50 to 100% of the cost, that\u2019s why COBRA is so expensive,\u201d said Anthony Lopez, vice president of operations for eHealth.com https://www.ehealthinsurance.com, a nationwide aggregator.\n\nLopez said most people calling eHealth now are looking for other options besides COBRA, and that means going through the state exchanges, private insurance or short-term plans. You can also go to state websites, healthcare.gov https://www.healthcare.gov or directly to insurance companies to find rates for your personal situation.\n\n\u201cPeople are scared,\u201d Lopez said, mostly because they fear they will not be able to get health insurance.\n\nLopez said he was not seeing denials, which is reassuring, but then the fear turns into sticker shock.\n\nThe key to picking the best plan is to figure out if it is better to pay less for the premium, but more of the actual cost of the care through a high deductible - and which level to choose.\n\nThe average monthly premium for 2020 was $456 for individuals and $1,134 for families, according to eHealth\u2019s latest analysis. Deductibles averaged $4,263 for individuals and $7,893 for families, meaning this is how much they would have to pay out of pocket, excluding services like well visits for children, before the insurance starts to pay.\n\nOptions for high-deductible plans have been prevalent for years, even through employer plans, but many would have these costs offset by the employer paying a big chunk of the premium and also contributing a lump sum toward the deductible.\n\nHelp might be available for premium reductions for those who qualify for government subsidies. The math will be a little tricky right now though, because the calculation is based on your last tax return. If you estimate your income based on your job loss, and then you get another job, you may owe a penalty, Lopez warned.\n\nDEALING WITH DEDUCTIBLES\n\nIt is not just Americans facing job losses who have to face the reality of high deductibles because of COVID-19. Those still on their workplace plans, who may have been furloughed but are able to keep their insurance, are having to manage their costs more than ever.\n\nResearchers at the University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy studied what happens financially to people who switch from traditional health plans to high-deductible plans, and found there was a significant increase in out-of-pocket spending and excessive financial burden.\n\n\u201cIf you are healthy and lucky, then a high deductible is a great thing for you,\u201d said Neeraj Sood, a professor at USC who worked on the study.\n\nNone of us is very lucky right now, however.\n\nIn reality, it is very easy to rip through a deductible of several thousand dollars. A couple of trips to urgent care at full price or an afternoon in an emergency room could do it.\n\nEven if the test for COVID-19 is a covered expense, there are all sorts of other costs you could face if you fall ill, and you are on the hook for normal healthcare costs too.\n\nIt takes advance planning to properly deal with these expenses, and that will not be something everyone can pull off with stretched finances.\n\nJeff Hicks, a certified financial planner from Illinois, is one model. He has had a $10,000 family deductible plan for nearly 20 years, and each year religiously puts aside the full amount of the deductible in a Health Savings Account, which is a specialized pre-tax account that also grows tax-free.\n\nFor the first four years, he spent none of it. Then his wife got very sick, and they went the next four years spending the full amount. Since then, they have gone back and forth on the spending.\n\n\u201cOnce she had this catastrophic deal, I knew we were looking at potentially having it every year. I resigned myself to the fact that this may be the path we\u2019re on,\u201d Hicks said.", "author": ["Beth Pinsker", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/0g2D71vYeK8/scaramuccis-skybridge-hit-with-heavy-redemption-requests-as-fund-fell-letter-idUSKCN22634P", "published": "2020-04-24T19:23:18", "title": "Scaramucci's SkyBridge hit with heavy redemption requests as fund fell: letter", "text": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors in SkyBridge Capital asked for hundreds of millions of dollars back after the fund suffered a 23% loss in March when investments made by its debt-focused hedge fund managers soured, Anthony Scaramucci wrote in a letter to clients, saying he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the loss.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Anthony Scaramucci, Founder and Co-Managing Partner at SkyBridge Capital, speaks during the opening remarks during the SALT conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. May 17, 2017.

Tynisa Gaines even talked down her own aunt on Facebook, after she shared a meme about people having to return the money.\n\n\u201cThis is not true. Do not share this,\u201d advised Gaines, who is an enrolled agent based in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe Economic Impact Payments to individuals are technically refundable tax credits on your 2020 return, which means they exist separately from whatever your tax liability will be for that year. When you file your return, there will be some kind of worksheet to input the payment you already received and it will tally up the correct amount you should have received.\n\nIf you got too little, you will receive the difference. If you got too much, you get to keep it. (Yes, keep it, no strings attached.)\n\nKubey revisited the language from the 2008 return, when there was a similar stimulus payment following the financial crash. \u201cThe instructions pretty clearly said: if you got too much, you don\u2019t have to pay it back.\u201d\n\n\u2018THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!\u2019\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Alan Pinck, an enrolled agent based in San Jose, California. He is dealing with a client whose husband passed away in 2019 and will be getting a stimulus payment for her spouse.\n\nDundon has a client who was single in 2018 and got a payment for herself and two kids. She got married in 2019 and filed a return with her new husband, who has one child.

When it is expected money like a tax refund, they tend to be practical and do things like pay down debt or make a large planned purchases.\n\nNewcomb said she did not yet know what she was going to do with the deposit that had just landed in her own account.

In fact, we were in that galaxy just three years ago.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Participants hold signs as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks at a news conference to introduce the \"Medicare for All Act of 2019\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 10, 2019. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo\n\nA higher Medicare age was an awful policy idea when the Republican-controlled House of Representatives pitched it in 2017 (reut.rs/3cjvT01). It was just as bad in various proposals from Paul Ryan to reform federal spending when he ran the House Budget Committee and served as speaker of the House. And just imagine what it could have meant during today's coronavirus outbreak, which disproportionately affects older adults who rely on Medicare.\n\nThe pandemic has made the yawning gaps and inequities in our health insurance system painfully obvious. And until now, the dream of universal health insurance coverage has seemed very distant.\n\nBut last week, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden became the first major-party candidate to call to expand access to Medicare by reducing the eligibility age to 60. This is a remarkable turning point - the standard bearer of a major party actually is calling for significant expansion of a government program. \u201cSuddenly, the government doesn\u2019t seem to be such a bad actor anymore,\u201d said Marilyn Moon, one of the nation\u2019s top experts on Medicare.\n\nMoon is an economist and former public trustee of both Medicare and Social Security. She co-chaired a recent study on ways to expand Medicare eligibility by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI).\n\nBiden\u2019s proposal was a concession to the progressive wing of his party aimed at unity for the fall election, and it was a step in the right direction. But the NASI report shows that dropping the Medicare age to 60 would be no more than a very incremental step. A new battle over health reform surely will emerge in the wake of the pandemic, and the outcome we need is universal, affordable health coverage for all that improves the quality of care.\n\nTHREE APPROACHES TO REFORM\n\nThe NASI study bit.ly/2K4Aya7 offers a fascinating in-depth look at three approaches to expanding Medicare eligibility: lowering the eligibility age, establishing Medicare for All, and creating a Medicare buy-in. The report was created by a study panel made up of 27 experts from a broad range of perspectives, such as economics, health policy, political science, sociology, medicine and law.\n\nThe report draws some surprising conclusions about the practicality of actually executing these approaches. Yes, Medicare for All might be the toughest putt from a political standpoint - but the optional buy-in - which sounded great rolling off the tongues of moderate candidates like Pete Buttigieg - actually is the most difficult to execute.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think that Medicare for All sounds nice, but that it is aspirational and very difficult, if not impossible to do in practice,\u201d said Moon. \u201cAnd the buy-in just sounds like it\u2019s not a big change. But we quickly realized that the buy-in was very complicated, because you take a complicated program like Medicare, which has a lot of moving parts, and then the even more complex Affordable Care Act structure and you try to marry the two in some way. It\u2019s very difficult to do.\u201d\n\nMedicare for All could achieve nearly universal coverage, and yield sizable administrative savings. But there are plenty of questions about how exactly it would be executed. These include the continued role - if any - of private insurance like Medicare Advantage, Medigap and prescription drug plans; benefits and cost sharing and financing mechanisms, to name just a few. From a political standpoint, a push for Medicare for All would provoke a donnybrook with the powerful health insurance lobby if it includes an end of commercial health insurance as we know it.\n\nA SWEET SPOT?\n\nReducing the Medicare age might just be the sweet spot, because it is fairly straightforward to implement and might not provoke the same intensity of political opposition.\n\nBut if we want to make a meaningful difference in healthcare coverage in this country, the age would need to move much lower than 60. The NASI study found that an entry point of age 62 would add 10.1 million to the Medicare rolls, but only 670,000 who had been uninsured because this older age group already has a comparatively low uninsured rate. Of course, that figure could be much higher now due to COVID-19-induced job losses.\n\nDropping the eligibility age to 50 would add 57.3 million new enrollees, 4.6 million of whom would have been uninsured. But that would come with its own set of questions. \u201cYou begin to change the nature of the people that are being covered, including many more families with children - but Medicare is an individually based insurance program,\u201d said Moon. \u201cYou also have to figure out whether or not the payment rates that Medicare uses that help make it inexpensive would be adequate for healthcare providers who suddenly would be covering many more of their patients under Medicare.\u201d\n\nA lower Medicare age would come with a few other complications, starting with how to finance the expansion. Medicare Part B (outpatient services) and Part D (prescription drugs) are paid for with a combination of enrollee premiums and government general revenue. But Part A (hospitalization) is financed through a payroll tax paid in advance by workers. The fund's actuarial assumptions are premised on serving only the 65-and-older population, and it already is on thin ice, facing an exhaustion date of 2026. (reut.rs/2RBxUwP) That date will likely move even closer due to the unanticipated cost of\n\ncaring for coronavirus patients.\n\nBiden has proposed to protect the Part A trust fund by financing the expense of serving new, younger enrollees from general revenue, rather than the payroll tax.\n\nIt is far too early in the pandemic crisis to know where this debate will go, and much will depend on the political makeup of Washington next year. But as the saying goes, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste nyti.ms/2ykhKkl.\n\nFor more on Medicare expansion, check out my podcast interview this week with Marilyn Moon bit.ly/3adkttp.\n\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)", "author": ["Mark Miller", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/ysXTsplob60/your-questions-on-the-lockdown-and-u-s-small-business-answered-idUSKCN21X3HA", "published": "2020-04-15T23:16:36", "title": "Your questions on the lockdown and U.S. small business, answered", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - After closing their doors to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, many small businesses face an uncertain future following government-ordered lockdowns.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A closed sign is shown on the window of a beach sports store during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Encinitas, California, U.S., April 9, 2020.

Hopefully, I will not have to do this for too many months. If so, I may need to re-evaluate my decision,\u201d Pauly said.\n\nMany small business owners are in a similar situation, where even an influx of relief cash will not help them stay afloat. The dilemma they face is whether to seek aid or close up, often by going bankrupt.\n\nSince small businesses often are tied into the lives of their owners, personal finances are on the line, too. Many owners mix personal and business expenses on their credit cards and use a house or other personal assets as collateral.\n\nWhile there are plenty of ways for owners to forestall catastrophe, like negotiating rent or mortgage delays, some businesses just do not have the cash flow to keep things going.\n\n\u201cBusiness bankruptcies go hand-in-hand with personal bankruptcy,\u201d said Carl Peterson, vice president of small firms at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\n\nThe first step is to do the math, and that will mean an immediate call to your accountant, if you have one. Ask: \u201cWhat is my revenue drop? What will it be in the next three to six months? What will my fixed costs be? What deferments can I get?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you have to figure out if that gap is going to be too large to recover from,\u201d said Ian Weinberg, a certified financial planner in Woodbury, New York.\n\nWeinberg noted that for now programs like the Paycheck Protection Program cover just a few months of payroll.

For instance, a restaurateur with a loan coming due in May will have trouble refinancing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important who owns the liability on your obligations,\u201d Bishop said, noting that if you have personally guaranteed the rent or a loan, your own finances will be dragged down, too.\n\nThis is the stage to bring in a business attorney, to sort out either how to ramp down the business legally, or go into bankruptcy.\n\nIf you are a one-person shop, you \u201ccan go away with minimal effort,\u201d said Kashif Ahmed, a certified financial planner in Bedford, Massachusetts. One of Ahmed\u2019s clients put his business in hibernation for now.\n\nIf you have employees or other obligations like a lease, insurance or inventory, then it gets more complicated.\n\nAnyone with a business structure like an LLC or an S Corporation needs a lawyer to do the proper filing to cease business operations, said Simon Hughes, a business attorney in Houston. Otherwise, you risk being sued by creditors, and you also risk your future business prospects.\n\nLitigation is what brings bankruptcy to a head. \u201cIf there is potentially going to be a big judgment against the entity, then bankruptcy is the only way to put a stop to it,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nOtherwise, you may be able to negotiate a settlement with creditors, because they realize that it is better to recover something like 70% of what is owed than risk what they will get from a judge.\n\nIf your business is so small that you do not have an accountant and a business lawyer on tap, there are resources available from the Small Business Association, said AICPA\u2019s Peterson.\n\nServices like Rocket Lawyer provide bankruptcy worksheets for free (here), but this is not a very do-it-yourself pursuit.\n\n\u201cWhile business owners are legally permitted to represent themselves from start to finish, that doesn\u2019t mean being their own bankruptcy lawyer is a good idea,\u201d said Charley Moore, an attorney and founder and CEO of Rocket Lawyer.", "author": ["Beth Pinsker", "Min Read"]}]}, "reuters_science": {"rss": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/scienceNews", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/news/science", "articles": [{"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/scienceNews/~3/zFNwAqG6AoM/abbott-coronavirus-test-is-accurate-infected-mothers-breast-milk-may-protect-infants-idUSKBN22K2GE", "published": "2020-05-08T17:36:57", "title": "Abbott coronavirus test is accurate; infected mother's breast milk may protect infants", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The following is a brief roundup of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A computer image created by Nexu Science Communication together with Trinity College in Dublin, shows a model structurally representative of a betacoronavirus which is the type of virus linked to COVID-19, better known as the coronavirus linked to the Wuhan outbreak, shared with Reuters on February 18, 2020. NEXU Science Communication/via REUTERS\n\nNew coronavirus antibody test highly accurate\n\nA new antibody test is highly accurate at determining whether people have been infected with the novel coronavirus, according to a study published on Friday in The Journal of Clinical Microbiology. Researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine found the test, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, had a specificity rate of 99.9% and a sensitivity rate of 100%, suggesting little chance of incorrectly diagnosing a healthy person as having been infected and virtually no chance of a false negative readout. Abbott's test has received emergency use authorization from the FDA and the company has already shipped more than 10 million of the tests to hospitals and labs.

Her team's report, posted on Friday on the preprint server medRxiv, has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal.

British physicians reporting on Thursday in The Lancet said the children initially have fever, rash, conjunctivitis, lower-limb swelling, pain in arms and legs, and \"significant\" gastrointestinal symptoms, even without testing positive for the coronavirus. The syndrome, while rare, can rapidly progress to critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation.

Some of the men were already recovering from their illness.\n\n\"If it could be proved that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted sexually ... (that) might be a critical part of the prevention,\" doctors at China's Shangqiu Municipal Hospital wrote in the medical journal JAMA Network Open on Thursday, adding that more research is needed.

They reanalyzed specimens from patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 whose test results had been negative or unclear and found less human DNA than they expected to see. Correct use of nasopharyngeal swabs to obtain a high quality specimen \"requires training and expertise as it involves insertion of the swab to ... a depth of roughly 7 centimeters (2.76 inches), followed by rotation and withdrawal,\" Zabrina Brumme of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia and colleagues say.

By contrast, public health measures like social distancing, school closures and sheltering at home do make a difference and were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth, Dr. Peter Juni at the University of Toronto and colleagues found in a report published on Friday in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).\n\n\"The important effect of public health interventions needs to be weighed carefully against potential economic and psychosocial harms when deciding when and how to lift restrictions,\" Juni's team concluded in their report.

Now, as major economies prepare green investments to kickstart growth, advocates spy a golden chance to drag the niche energy into the mainstream of a post-pandemic world.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The new Febus hydrogen bus is seen before a presentation in Pau, France, January 14, 2020. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\n\nGreen hydrogen was pushed to the fore last week when Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, said the technology was \u201cready for the big time\u201d and urged governments to channel investments into the fuel.\n\nSome countries, including the Netherlands, Australia and Portugal, have already begun investing in the technology. Now investors, politicians and businesses are pushing the European Union and others to use its post-crisis recovery plan to support hydrogen in areas like trucking and heavy industry.\n\nThe promise of hydrogen as a fuel to help power vehicles and energy plants has been a talking point since the 1970s, but it is currently too expensive for widespread use. Proponents say infrastructure investment and more demand from transport, gas grids and industry will bring the cost down.\n\nMost hydrogen used today is extracted from natural gas in a process that produces carbon emissions, which defeats the object for many policymakers. But there is potential to extract \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen from water with electrolysis, an energy-intensive but carbon-free process if powered by renewable electricity.\n\nEU officials, one of whom described green hydrogen as the \u201choly grail\u201d, said it could replace fossil fuels in sectors that lack alternatives to align operations with the EU\u2019s Green Deal plan to reduce net emissions to zero by 2050.\n\n\u201cHydrogen could solve a lot of problems. We need everything else as well but the political interest is because to achieve deep energy efficiency and decarbonisation, hydrogen seems relatively easy,\u201d said Jesse Scott, senior advisor at think-tank Agora Energiewende.\n\n\u201cIt is less alarming (for policymakers) than some other elements for meeting net zero,\u201d she added, such as carbon removal technology for example.\n\nHYDROGEN GAINING MOMENTUM\n\nMomentum appears to be building; EU industry chief Thierry Breton met hydrogen companies online this week to discuss the bloc\u2019s recovery from the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe could use these circumstances, where loads of public money are going to be needed into the energy system, to jump forward towards a hydrogen economy,\u201d said Diederik Samsom, who heads the European Commission\u2019s climate cabinet.\n\nThis could result in hydrogen use scaling up faster than was expected before the pandemic, he added.\n\nThe European Commission has earmarked clean hydrogen - a loose term which can include gas-based hydrogen, if fitted with technology to capture the resulting emissions - as a \u201cpriority area\u201d for industry in its Green Deal.\n\nOver the past year, several governments, including Germany, Britain, Australia and Japan, have announced or have been working on hydrogen strategies and the pace has picked up over the past month during the pandemic.\n\nThis week, Australia set aside A$300 million ($191 million) to jumpstart hydrogen projects. Portugal plans to build a new solar-powered hydrogen plant which will produce hydrogen by electrolysis by 2023.\n\nThe Netherlands unveiled a hydrogen strategy in late March, outlining plans for 500 megawatts (MW) of green electrolyser capacity by 2025. A German hydrogen strategy is expected later this month.\n\nThe Dutch government is pushing for the EU to follow suit and present an \u201caction plan\u201d for clean hydrogen, a spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nCAN IT BECOME AFFORDABLE?\n\nWhen it comes to transport, hydrogen fuel cells trail electric batteries in the push for greener cars, given their higher price and the lack of refuelling stations. But proponents see potential for heavier vehicles.\n\nDaimler and Volvo Trucks unveiled plans last month to bring hydrogen fuelled heavy-duty vehicles to market within the decade.\n\nHydrogen gas is already used in industry to produce ammonia, which goes into fertilisers, and methanol, used to make plastic.\n\nA major drawback of the green hydrogen that governments are most interested in, is that it requires a large amount of renewable electricity to produce. The good news is, renewables prices have fallen sharply in recent years.\n\nAccording to Bernstein analysts, hydrogen made from fossil fuels currently costs between $1-$1.8/kg. Green hydrogen can cost around $6/kg today, making it significantly more expensive than the fossil fuel alternatives.\n\nHowever, increased demand could reduce the cost of electrolysis. Coupled with falling renewable energy costs, green hydrogen could fall to $1.7/kg by 2050 and possibly sub-$1/kg, making it competitive with natural gas. Higher carbon prices would also encourage the shift.\n\n\u201cClean hydrogen produced from electricity is around three times more expensive than that from natural gas, but solar and wind costs have decreased in recent years and if they continue to fall, clean hydrogen produced with lower electricity costs would become more affordable,\u201d said Philippe Vie, global energy and utilities lead at consultancy Capgemini.\n\n\u201cOn hydrogen we are right now where we were with renewables in 2000-2005. Ten to 15 years is probably a good time lapse to become competitive,\u201d he added.\n\nMAJOR MONEY NEEDED\n\nAny serious attempt at large-scale use - either in industry or transportation - would also require major infrastructure investments. For example, power from an offshore wind farm would need to be connected to an electrolyser that produces the green hydrogen, which would then need to be transported to end users.\n\nEurope has around 135 MW of electrolyser capacity, but planned green hydrogen projects could bring that to 5.2 gigawatts, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie. But many projects hinge on further investment partners or subsidies, which advocates fear will be scarcer in the COVID-19-induced economic slump.\n\n\u201cInvestments that would have been foreseen to be done now are not made because production is delayed,\u201d Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, secretary general of lobby group Hydrogen Europe, told Reuters.\n\nTo help lower costs, several projects are being worked on across the gas infrastructure, industry, mining and energy sectors.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Dutch gas firm Gasunie unveiled plans in February to build a mammoth wind-powered hydrogen plant in the northern Netherlands, capable of producing 800,000 tonnes of hydrogen by 2040.\n\nIn Germany, oil refinery Raffinerie Heide is embarking on a project using excess wind energy and abundant water supply in the region to produce hydrogen to make kerosene.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cThe price of hydrogen we pay for now is four times natural gas from an external source fed through the pipeline and produced 30 km away,\u201d said CEO Juergen Wollschlaeger.\n\nA big fear for companies in the hydrogen industry is that they will be unable to take advantage of the unique opportunity presented by vast economic stimulus packages, and that governments will favour supporting traditional high-carbon fuel sectors that have been hit hard by a collapse in energy demand.\n\n\u201cFor us, that will be the question to be answered in the next weeks.

They found almost 200 recurrent genetic mutations of the new coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2 - that show how it may be evolving as it spreads in people.\n\n\"All viruses naturally mutate,\" Francois Balloux of University College London, who co-led the research, told Reuters. \"Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected.

Researchers looked back at 2,773 patients, about one in four of whom had received a high dose of blood clot preventers. Patients who got this treatment were more likely to survive, the researchers reported on Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The difference was most pronounced among the 395 patients who needed mechanical ventilation. In this group, the death rate was 63% without anticoagulants and 29% when patients did get blood thinners.\n\nThe researchers note that because the study was not randomized, it cannot prove the drugs directly led to better survival. Large randomized trials are needed to confirm a benefit, researchers said, and any potential benefit needs to be weighed against the increased risk of bleeding with these drugs.

In fact, some recovered patients did not have these antibodies at all, which, he said, suggests that their immune systems fought off the virus in some unknown way.

Among a total of more than 1,600 infected patients in North America, Asia and Europe, nearly 53% had diminished or loss of sense of smell, and nearly 44% had problems with taste. In the subset of studies that used particularly reliable tests to evaluate patients' ability to smell and taste, rates of dysfunction were even higher, suggesting \"that the true prevalence of dysfunction in COVID-19 patients may remain underestimated,\" the research team wrote on Tuesday in the journal Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery.

Broadly, they say, interventions fall into the categories of clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and practical and psychological support.\n\nAmong their specific recommendations are changes to practice, such as screening stations to funnel infected patients to specific areas, redesigning of procedures that pose high risks for spread of infection, and reducing the density of patients on wards.

The gut microbiome composition in infants and toddlers changes extensively in the first three years of life. But where do those microbes come from in the first place?\n\nScientists have long been able to analyze the gut microbiome at the level of the 500 to 1,000 different bacterial species that mainly have a beneficial influence; only more recently have they been able to identify individual strains within a single species using powerful genomic tools and supercomputers that analyze massive amounts of genetic data.\n\nResearchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham now have used their microbiome \"fingerprint\" method to report that an individualized mosaic of microbial strains is transmitted to the infant gut microbiome from a mother giving birth through vaginal delivery. They detailed this transmission by analyzing existing metagenomic databases of fecal samples from mother-infant pairs, as well as analyzing mouse dam and pup transmission in a germ-free, or gnotobiotic, mouse model at UAB, where the dams were inoculated with human fecal microbes.\n\n\"The results of our analysis demonstrate that multiple strains of maternal microbes -- some that are not abundant in the maternal fecal community -- can be transmitted during birth to establish a diverse infant gut microbial community,\" said Casey Morrow, Ph.D., professor emeritus in UAB's Department of Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology. \"Our analysis provides new insights into the origin of microbial strains in the complex infant microbial community.\"\n\nThe study used a strain-tracking bioinformatics tool previously developed at UAB, called Window-based Single-nucleotide-variant Similarity, or WSS. Hyunmin Koo, Ph.D., UAB Department of Genetics and Genomics Core, led the informatics analysis. The gnotobiotic mouse model studies were led by Braden McFarland, Ph.D., assistant professor in the UAB Department of Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology.\n\nMorrow and colleagues have used this microbe fingerprint tool in several previous strain-tracking studies. In 2017, they found that fecal donor microbes -- used to treat patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infections -- remained in recipients for months or years after fecal transplants. In 2018, they showed that changes in the upper gastrointestinal tract through obesity surgery led to the emergence of new strains of microbes. In 2019, they analyzed the stability of new strains in individuals after antibiotic treatments, and earlier this year, they found that adult twins, ages 36 to 80 years old, shared a certain strain or strains between each pair for periods of years, and even decades, after they began living apart from each other.\n\nIn the current study, several individual-specific patterns of microbial strain-sharing were found between mothers and infants. Three mother-infant pairs showed only related strains, while a dozen other infants of mother-infant pairs contained a mosaic of maternal-related and unrelated microbes. It could be that the unrelated strains came from the mother, but they had not been the dominant strain of that species in the mother, and so had not been detected.\n\nIndeed, in a second study using a dataset from nine women taken at different times in their pregnancies showed that strain variations in individual species occurred in seven of the women.\n\nTo further define the source of the unrelated strains, a mouse model was used to look at transmission from dam to pup in the absence of environmental microbes. Five different females were given transplants of different human fecal matter to create five unique humanized-microbiome mice, which were bred with gnotobiotic males. The researchers then analyzed the strains found in the human donors, the mouse dams and their mouse pups. They found four different patterns: 1) The pup's strain of a particular species was related to the dam's strain; 2) The pup's strain was related to both the dam's strain and the human donor's strain; 3) The pup's strain was related to the human donor's strain, but not to the dam's strain; and, importantly, 4) No related strains for a particular species were found between the pup, the dam and the human donor. Since these animals were bred and raised in germ-free conditions, the unrelated strains in the pups came from minor, undetected strains in the dams.\n\n\"The results of our studies support a reconsideration of the contribution of different maternal microbes to the infant enteric microbial community,\" Morrow said. \"The constellation of microbial strains that we detected in the infants inherited from the mother was different in each mother-infant pair. Given the recognized role of the microbiome in metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, the results of our study could help to further explain the susceptibility of the infant to metabolic disease found in the mother.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508184601.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T22:46:01", "title": "The role of European policy for improving power plant fuel efficiency", "text": "A new study published in the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists investigates the impact of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the largest international cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions in the world, on power plant fuel efficiency.\n\nIn \"The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and Fuel Efficiency of Fossil Fuel Power Plants in Germany\" author Robert Germeshausen studies German power plants and finds that a reduction in fuel use by fossil fuel power plants due to the introduction of the EU ETS translates into reductions in total annual carbon emissions of about 1.5 to 2 percent within the German power sector.\n\nTo put this improvement into context, this decrease in fuel input on average is equivalent to a reduction of around four to six million tons in annual carbon emissions. The results point to the role of actual investment in generation technology to improve fuel efficiency as Germeshausen finds positive effects on large investments in machinery.\n\nThe power sector is central to climate protection strategies, including those in Germany, where it accounts for around 40 percent of total annual carbon emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that reducing the carbon intensity of electricity generation (also known as decarbonizing) is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies. \"Hence, understanding the effects of existing climate policies on the power sector is crucial for the further development of policies to achieve mitigation targets efficiently,\" writes Germeshausen.\n\nThe EU ETS puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions from regulated installations to achieve emission reductions and to provide incentives for investments in low-carbon technologies. Germeshausen utilizes administrative annual plant-level data covering around 85 percent of fossil fuel electricity generation in Germany from 2003 to 2012. Germany's electricity generation fleet consists of a variety of hard coal, lignite, nuclear, and natural gas power plants as well as renewable energy installations.\n\nGermeshausen draws conclusions on the effect of carbon pricing on the optimal input combination in electricity generation and also on fuel efficiency improvements as a measure to reduce carbon emissions in the power sector. He additionally analyzes potential effects on labor efficiency, investments in machinery, and utilization of power plants.\n\nUnlike previous studies on productivity and efficiency effects from policies and regulation in the electricity generation sector, which focus mainly on the effects of deregulation on productivity and efficiency, this study differs with respect to the nature of the influence. \"Understanding the impacts on regulated entities is crucial for the assessment and the further development of mitigation policies such as emission trading schemes,\" Germeshausen writes. Given the high variable cost share of fuel in power generation, the introduction of a carbon price may provide carbon intensive power plants with an incentive to improve fuel efficiency.\n\nGermeshausen finds that the ETS negatively impacts the capacity factor, i.e., carbon intensive plants produce less output in relation to their potential output compared to less carbon intensive plants. \"Thus, the effect should be interpreted as a positive net effect on fuel efficiency, exceeding a potential negative fuel efficiency effect from decreased utilization of carbon intensive power plants.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508184559.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T22:45:59", "title": "Seahorse and pipefish study opens window to marine genetic diversity", "text": "The direction of ocean currents can determine the direction of gene flow in rafting species, but this depends on species traits that allow for rafting propensity.

These cells, that are part of an expanding family of dendritic cells, play a crucial role presenting antigens to other immune cells during respiratory virus infections, and could explain how convalescent plasma helps to boost immune responses in virus-infected patients.\n\nInflammation and immunity\n\nWhen our body faces an infection, it responds with inflammation and fever. This is a sign that the immune system does its work, and leads to the activation of many cells, like soldiers in an army. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the generals of that army. They can precisely activate and instruct the soldiers to kill infected cells by presenting antigens derived from the 'invaders' to cells of the immune system.\n\nMistaken identity\n\nThere are several types of DCs that perform antigen-presenting functions in the body. A first type of conventional DCs continuously scan the body for dangerous invaders, even when there is no infection. When there is inflammation triggered by infection, another subset of DCs emerges from inflammatory monocytes. Because monocyte-derived DCs are easily prepared in vitro from monocytes isolated form human blood, it was always assumed these cells were very important antigen-presenting cells. Clinical trials using monocyte-derived DCs in cancer therapy have however been disappointing.\n\nA study by the teams of Bart Lambrecht, Martin Guilliams, Hamida Hammad, and Charlotte Scott (all from the VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research) and international colleagues, shows that monocyte-derived DCs are poor antigen-presenting cells, but have wrongly been assumed to have these functions because of a case of mistaken identity.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe scientists studied mice with a viral respiratory infection (pneumonia virus of mice and influenza virus) with single-cell technologies. This single-cell resolution allowed them to finely separate the monocyte-derived cells from other DCs during their response to the infection. They found that monocyte-derived DCs do exist, but actually do not present antigens. The reason for all the confusion in the past is that a look-alike new DC emerges -- called inflammatory type 2 conventional DC, or inf-cDC2 -- that combines some of the best characteristics of monocytes, macrophages, and conventional DCs, to induce the best form of immunity.\n\nBart Lambrecht: \"This was a big surprise for us. We've all been taught that monocyte-derived cells are excellent antigen presenting cells, certainly when there's inflammation. Now, we show that it's actually a new hybrid DC type that's doing all the work. This really changes what we know about the immune system and is very important knowledge for understanding respiratory viral infections and other inflammatory diseases.\"\n\nMartin Guilliams: \"It took a massive team effort but the strength of single-cell sequencing has finally cracked the complex DC code. Many contradicting findings from the last two decades now make much more sense. This also opens tremendous therapeutic opportunities, since vaccination strategies can now be designed to trigger formation of inf-cDC2s and thus generate a stronger antiviral immune response.\"\n\nCharlotte Scott: \"Through the use of single cell technologies we have been able to align all the findings from the past few years and identify the distinct cell types involved. Moving forward it will be very interesting to see under what other inflammatory conditions these inf-cDC2s are generated and how they can potentially be targeted therapeutically.\"\n\nConvalescent plasma and COVID-19\n\nThe findings of the researchers also have a direct relevance for the current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by another respiratory virus. An emergency treatment that is currently being explored is the use of convalescent plasma, or the blood plasma of recovered patients.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCedric Bosteels, lead author of the new paper: \"One of the unique features of the new DCs is that they express functional Fc receptors for antibodies that are found in the plasma of patients who have recovered from COVID-19\"\n\nThis study is the first to show that one of the mechanisms through which convalescent plasma and the virus-specific antibodies in it work, is via boosting of inf-cDC2.

The findings, published May 8 in Science Advances, suggest that sleep may be an evolutionary tool that helps animals adapt to challenging new situations.\n\n\"We know that sleep is involved in creativity and insight,\" said senior author Paul Shaw, PhD, a professor of neuroscience. \"Have you ever slept on a problem, and when you wake up you've found the answer? Anxiety keeps people up at night, but if you find yourself in a dangerous environment, or in a situation that you don't know how to deal with, sleep may be exactly what you need to respond to it effectively.\"\n\nFruit flies' sleep looks a lot like people's. Baby flies need a lot of sleep, but as they get older, their need for sleep diminishes. Flies become more alert with caffeine and drowsier with antihistamines. And if you keep a fly awake one day, it will sleep more the next.\n\nThese similarities suggest that the sleep habits of flies might shed light on the sleep habits of people. To explore the relationship between challenging circumstances and sleep, Shaw and staff scientist and first author Krishna Melnattur, PhD, took away flies' ability to fly.\n\nBaby flies must expand their wings in the first half hour or so after emerging from pupal cases, or their wings will not develop properly. The researchers placed some newly emerged flies in tiny containers so they could not expand their wings, and they genetically modified other flies so that the insects' wings failed to expand. Both scenarios rendered the young flies permanently flightless. The researchers also grounded older flies by disabling their wings. In all cases, faced with the inability to fly, the animals slept more than usual.\n\nIn subsequent experiments, the researchers traced the neurological circuit that signals to the brain that the wings aren't functioning and triggers the impulse to sleep more.\n\n\"When we identified the neurons that were activated when we cut or glued the wings of adult flies, they turned out to be the same neurons involved in the normal developmental process of wing expansion after emergence,\" Melnattur said.\n\nThe fact that wing injury and normal wing development are linked to sleep through the same neurological circuitry makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint, the researchers said. The circuit is active in young flies because their developing brains need sleep as the animals expand their wings, learn to fly and begin to navigate the world around them.\n\n\"And then the whole circuit can get reactivated later in life when something happens that forces a fly to adapt to a new normal,\" Shaw said. \"Suddenly, its brain needs to be as flexible as when it was young. It can no longer fly, but it still needs to get food, it needs to compete for mates, it needs to avoid dying. We think that sleep amplifies the brain plasticity the fly needs to survive.\"\n\nShaw and Melnattur are planning experiments to determine whether increased sleep helps flightless flies survive. Their findings also may provide clues to why some people sleep more than others and why some sleep disorders arise.\n\n\"There's huge variation in sleep time among people,\" Shaw said. \"Some people need five hours a night; some need nine. Sleep is an ancient process, and we've evolved mechanisms to change our sleep-wake balance to help us meet our needs. If these mechanisms get inappropriately activated, say by a traumatic event that triggers post-traumatic stress disorder, it can create a situation in which you're sleeping too much or too little and it's no longer matching up with your needs, and then you have a sleep disorder.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508145329.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T18:53:29", "title": "Inspired by cheetahs, researchers build fastest soft robots yet", "text": "Inspired by the biomechanics of cheetahs, researchers have developed a new type of soft robot that is capable of moving more quickly on solid surfaces or in the water than previous generations of soft robots. The new soft robotics are also capable of grabbing objects delicately -- or with sufficient strength to lift heavy objects.\n\n\"Cheetahs are the fastest creatures on land, and they derive their speed and power from the flexing of their spines,\" says Jie Yin, an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University and corresponding author of a paper on the new soft robots.\n\n\"We were inspired by the cheetah to create a type of soft robot that has a spring-powered, 'bistable' spine, meaning that the robot has two stable states,\" Yin says. \"We can switch between these stable states rapidly by pumping air into channels that line the soft, silicone robot. Switching between the two states releases a significant amount of energy, allowing the robot to quickly exert force against the ground. This enables the robot to gallop across the surface, meaning that its feet leave the ground.\n\n\"Previous soft robots were crawlers, remaining in contact with the ground at all times. This limits their speed.\"\n\nThe fastest soft robots until now could move at speeds of up to 0.8 body lengths per second on flat, solid surfaces. The new class of soft robots, which are called \"Leveraging Elastic instabilities for Amplified Performance\" (LEAP), are able to reach speeds of up to 2.7 body lengths per second -- more than three times faster -- at a low actuation frequency of about 3Hz. These new robots are also capable of running up steep inclines, which can be challenging or impossible for soft robots that exert less force against the ground.\n\nThese \"galloping\" LEAP robots are approximately 7 centimeters long and weigh about 45 grams.\n\nThe researchers also demonstrated that the LEAP design could improve swimming speeds for soft robots.

Across the world, many research groups are investigating plasma medicine for applications including cancer treatment and the accelerated healing of chronic wounds, among others.\n\nResearchers from Penn State's College of Engineering, College of Agricultural Sciences and College of Medicine say direct LTP treatment and plasma-activated media are effective treatments against bacteria found in liquid cultures. The researchers also say they have devised a unique way to create plasma directly in liquids.\n\nThe team, comprised of engineers, physicists, veterinary and biomedical scientists and medical professionals, is using an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet to use room temperature -- \"cold\" -- plasma to treat bacteria.\n\nPlasma, the fourth state of matter, is typically very hot -- thousands to millions of degrees. By using plasma generated at atmospheric pressure or in liquids, the researchers can create molecules and atoms with antibacterial effects without burning anything. Sean Knecht, assistant teaching professor of engineering design at Penn State and leader of the Cross-disciplinary Laboratory for Integrated Plasma Science and Engineering, said this process creates many different types of reactive particles, making the likelihood of bacterial mutations to simultaneously combat all the particles almost nonexistent.\n\nKnecht explained that the team's research results, published in Scientific Reports, show that plasma technology generates large amounts of reactive oxygen species or reactive particles created from molecules that contain oxygen atoms, including oxygen molecules in the air and water vapor. The plasma's effect on different bacteria such as E. coli and Staph. aureus is significant, resulting in many bacterial deaths through multiple generations.\n\n\"Over the course of four generations of bacteria, these bacteria do not acquire any form of resistance to the plasma treatment,\" he said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nGirish Kirimanjeswara, associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Penn State, said this is extremely important due to the typical way bacteria mutate, making them resistant to antibiotics.\n\nAntibiotics target a specific metabolic pathway, essential protein or nucleic acids in bacteria. Because of this, antibiotics have to enter a bacterial cell to find and bind to that specific target. Any bacterial mutation that decreases an antibiotic's entry capabilities or increases its rate of exit makes the antibiotic less effective. Mutations happen naturally at a low rate but can rapidly accumulate by selection pressure when introduced to antibiotics aimed at fighting the bacteria.\n\nAccording to Kirimanjeswara, the team's research results show that plasma treatment produces various reactive oxygen species at a concentration high enough to kill bacteria, but low enough to not have negative impacts on human cells. He explained that the oxygen species quickly target virtually every part of the bacteria including proteins, lipids and nucleic acids.\n\n\"One can call it a sledgehammer approach,\" Kirimanjeswara said. \"It is difficult to develop resistance by any single mutation or even by a bunch of mutations.\"\n\nThe team also applied these findings to design a system that can create plasma directly in liquids. The researchers intend to create plasma in blood to address cardiovascular infections directly at the source. To do so, high electric voltage and large electric currents are typically used. In the plasma system created by the researchers, the electrical current and energy that might reach the patient are minimized by using dielectric, or electrically-insulating, materials. Materials that the team would typically use to create the plasma include glass and ceramic due to their capability to withstand high local temperatures. These materials tend to make blood clot and may not be very flexible, a necessity if they are to be used in the cardiovascular system. The team is investigating insulating coatings that are biocompatible, or acceptable by the human body, and flexible. Knecht said the team has identified a polymer called Parylene-C and reported the initial results in the journal IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences. The team is further pursuing this avenue, as polymers have low melting points and may not withstand repeated exposure to plasma.\n\n\"Biocompatible polymers can be used for plasma generation in biological liquids, but their lifetime is limited,\" Knecht said. \"New unique plasma generation designs must be developed to produce lower intensity plasma discharges that can extend their lifetime. That is what we are continuing to work on.\"\n\nKirimanjeswara said scientists typically work to understand how different bacteria cause disease or how host immune responses eliminate bacteria to create new antibiotics and vaccines. Though these more traditional approaches are essential, they are often gradual and time-consuming. The team's innovative research highlights the importance of continuing to investigate new ways to combat bacteria.\n\n\"Transformative and cross-disciplinary approaches have the potential to speed up finding solutions to urgent global problems,\" he said. \"It is important for the general public to be aware of and appreciate the fact that the scientific community is engaged in several approaches, some traditional and others nontraditional, to combat the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. We hope our research reinforces the idea of embracing nonantibiotic approaches to treat bacterial infections in the future.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508145326.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T18:53:26", "title": "Promising study offers hope for Menkes disease patients: Repurposing cancer drug for disorders of copper deficiency", "text": "A Texas A&M AgriLife research team has good news for patients with copper-deficiency disorders, especially young children diagnosed with Menkes disease.\n\nA team led by James Sacchettini, Ph.D. professor and Welch Chair of Science, and Vishal Gohil, Ph.D., associate professor, both from the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Texas A&M University, published a paper in Science outlining their latest discoveries of how using the cancer drug elesclomol holds promise for treating copper deficiencies in Menkes disease.\n\nThe research funding was provided by the Chancellor's Research Initiative of The Texas A&M University System, the Welch Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\"With all biology connected, it's great to see this innovative research from the agriculture and life sciences departments making a significant connection to an area of human health,\" said Patrick J. Stover, Ph.D., vice chancellor of Texas A&M AgriLife, dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and director of AgriLife Research.\n\nMenkes disease\n\nMenkes is a rare genetic disorder occurring in about 1 in every 50,000-300,000 births. Young children with the disorder typically die within three years of life due to a genetic mutation that limits their body's ability to absorb and utilize copper from their diet. The copper deficiency leads to severe brain damage and neuromuscular deficits.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Experimental treatments have not been effective at overcoming the most severe symptoms of the disease or early mortality,\" Sacchettini said.\n\n\"Our current work documenting the efficacy of elesclomol in a mouse model of Menkes disease takes us one step closer to the clinical trials,\" Gohil said.\n\nCopper deficiency\n\nNormally, copper is acquired through diet from foods such as fish, organ meats, nuts and beans, said Liam Guthrie, a doctoral candidate in Sacchettini's lab and lead author of the paper. He explained that dietary copper is normally absorbed in the intestines, then exported to the liver for distribution throughout the body.\n\nIn Menkes disease, that process is disrupted. The copper absorbed by intestinal cells must be exported into the blood by a copper transport protein. If that protein is not functioning well, due to genetic mutations, the copper can't be distributed to various parts of the body. The brain, heart and other tissues thus become copper deficient.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnd, when copper is deficient in these tissues, certain enzymes fail to activate, Gohil explained. One such enzyme is mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase complex, which is required for energy production.\n\n\"Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase is an enzyme present in almost all cells in our body and uses a majority of the oxygen that we breathe,\" Gohil said.\n\nThis enzyme only works if it has copper in it, he explained. Without copper, the enzyme won't function, and the body stops working due to lack of energy production.\n\nFinding the drug\n\nGohil began working on this project in 2012, and in 2014 his team began focusing on elesclomol and showed that it can deliver copper to mitochondria and restore the production of cytochrome oxidase protein complex in copper-deficient yeast and human cells, as well as in zebrafish.\n\nIn 2017, Gohil's graduate student Shivatheja Soma and postdoctoral fellow Mohammad Zulkifli, Ph.D., began collaborating with Guthrie, Andres Silva and others from the Sacchettini group. They began to translate the laboratory results into a preclinical mouse model of Menkes disease.\n\nThe team focused on developing procedures for using elesclomol to treat Menkes and optimizing treatment strategies to find the right doses.\n\n\"These were difficult and time-consuming experiments that required special precautions because we were working with very sick mice, ones that carried the same type of mutation as humans with severe Menkes disease,\" Guthrie said. \"These mice showed very similar symptoms to babies with the disease. We had hope that if we could successfully treat these mice, we would be able to translate the discoveries to infants.\"\n\nSacchettini said the first step was to overcome the side effects of using a cancer drug to treat the disease. The major breakthrough came when their group came up with a new way to prepare the drug.\n\n\"We found that by mixing elesclomol with copper in a special formulation, we could keep the new form of the drug soluble prior to administration,\" he said. \"With this approach we were able to dramatically increase survival of the mice and, importantly, to normalize their brain development.\"\n\nThe collaborators from the University of Maryland, led by Byung-Eun Kim, Ph.D., showed that elesclomol could overcome more than just defects in the transporter that causes Menkes disease. The medication also targeted a second copper transporter, one implicated in the development of hypertrophic heart and liver disorders in mice and humans -- indicating the therapeutic applications of elesclomol may not be limited to Menkes disease.\n\nGohil's group and Michael Petris, Ph.D., from the University of Missouri, showed that elesclomol escorted copper to different tissues and delivered it to copper-utilizing enzymes like cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondria.\n\nPromising results\n\nThrough this mechanism, elesclomol prevented brain damage and improved the survival of Menkes mice from a mere 14 days to over 200 days.\n\nWhile there is still more work to do in preparation for treating infants with Menkes disease, Sacchettini and Gohil say they are confident they will soon be able to extend the survival and quality of life for those born with this devastating disease.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508145324.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T18:53:24", "title": "To err is human, to learn, divine", "text": "The human brain is a highly advanced information processor composed of more than 86 billion neurons. Humans are adept at recognizing patterns from complex networks, such as languages, without any formal instruction. Previously, cognitive scientists tried to explain this ability by depicting the brain as a highly optimized computer, but there is now discussion among neuroscientists that this model might not accurately reflect how the brain works.\n\nNow, Penn researchers have developed an different model for how the brain interprets patterns from complex networks. Published in Nature Communications, this new model shows that the ability to detect patterns stems in part from the brain's goal to represent things in the simplest way possible. Their model depicts the brain as constantly balancing accuracy with simplicity when making decisions. The work was conducted by physics Ph.D. student Christopher Lynn, neuroscience Ph.D. student Ari Kahn, and professor Danielle Bassett.\n\nThis new model is built upon the idea that people make mistakes while trying to make sense of patterns, and these errors are essential to get a glimpse of the bigger picture. \"If you look at a pointillist painting up close, you can correctly identify every dot. If you step back 20 feet, the details get fuzzy, but you'll gain a better sense of the overall structure,\" says Lynn.\n\nTo test their hypothesis, the researchers ran a set of experiments similar to a previous study by Kahn. That study found that when participants were shown repeating elements in a sequence, such as A-B-C-B, etc., they were automatically sensitive to certain patterns without being explicitly aware that the patterns existed. \"If you experience a sequence of information, such as listening to speech, you can pick up on certain statistics between elements without being aware of what those statistics are,\" says Kahn.\n\nTo understand how the brain automatically understands such complex associations within sequences, 360 study participants were shown a computer screen with five gray squares corresponding to five keys on a keyboard. As two of the five squares changed from gray to red, the participants had to strike the computer keys that corresponded to the changing squares. For the participants, the pattern of color-changing squares was random, but the sequences were actually generated using two kinds of networks.\n\nThe researchers found that the structure of the network impacted how quickly the participants could respond to the stimuli, an indication of their expectations of the underlying patterns. Responses were quicker when participants were shown sequences that were generated using a modular network compared to sequences coming from a lattice network.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile these two types of networks look different to the human eye at a large scale, they are actually statistically identical to one another at small scales. There are the same number of connections between the nodes and edges, even though the overall shape is different. \"A computer would not care about this difference in large-scale structure, but it's being picked up by the brain. Subjects could better understand the modular network's underlying structure and anticipate the upcoming image,\" says Lynn.\n\nUsing tools from information theory and reinforcement learning, the researchers were able to use this data to implement a metric of complexity called entropy. \"Being very random is the least complex thing you could do, whereas if you were learning the sequence very precisely, that's the most complex thing you can do. The balance between errors and complexity, or negative entropy, gives rise to the predictions that the model gives,\" says Lynn.\n\nTheir resulting model of how the brain processes information depicts the brain as balancing two opposing pressures: complexity versus accuracy. \"You can be very complex and learn well, but then you are working really hard to learn patterns,\" says Lynn. \"Or, you have a lower complexity process, which is easier, but you are not going to learn the patterns as well.\"\n\nWith their new model, the researchers were also able to quantify this balance using a parameter beta. If beta is zero, the brain makes a lot of errors but minimizes complexity. If beta is high, then the brain is taking precautions to avoid making errors. \"All beta does is tune between which is dominating,\" says Lynn. In this study, 20% of the participants had a small beta, 10% had high beta values, and the remaining 70% were somewhere in between. \"You do see this wide spread of beta values across people,\" he says.\n\nKahn says that this idea of balancing forces wasn't surprising, given the huge amount of information the brain has to process under a limited amount of resources and without spending too much time on simple decisions. \"The brain is already using up a huge amount of metabolic costs, so you really want to maximize what you are getting out,\" he says. \"If you think about something as basic as attention, there is an inherent trade off in maximizing accuracy versus everything else you are ignoring.\"\n\nAnd what about the role of making mistakes? Their model provides support for the idea that the human brain isn't an optimal learning machine but rather that making mistakes, and learning from them, plays a huge role in behavior and cognition. It seems that being able to look at complex systems more broadly, like stepping away from a pointillist painting, gives the brain a better idea of overall relationships.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Understanding structure, or how these elements relate to one another, can emerge from an imperfect encoding of the information. If someone were perfectly able to encode all of the incoming information, they wouldn't necessarily understand the same kind of grouping of experiences that they do if there's a little bit of fuzziness to it,\" says Kahn.\n\n\"The coolest thing is that errors in how people are learning and perceiving the world are influencing our ability to learn structures. So we are very much divorced from how a computer would act,\" says Lynn.\n\nThe researchers are now interested in what makes the modular network easier for the brain to interpret and are also conducting functional MRI studies to understand where in the brain these network associations are being formed. They are also curious as to whether people's balance of complexity and accuracy is fluid, whether people can change on their own or if they are \"set,\" and also hope to do experiments using language inputs sometime in the future.\n\n\"After better understanding how healthy adult humans build these network models of our world, we are excited to turn to the study of psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia in which patients build inaccurate or otherwise altered models of their worlds,\" says Bassett. \"Our initial work paves the way for new efforts in the emerging field of computational psychiatry.\"\n\nThis research was primarily supported by the U.S. Army Research Office through Grant DCIST- W911NF-17-2-0181 and National Science Foundation through Grant NSF PHY-1554488.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508145321.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T18:53:21", "title": "To climb like a gecko, robots need toes: Robot designers take heed: adjustable hairy toes help geckos run sideways along walls", "text": "Robots with toes? Experiments suggest that climbing robots could benefit from having flexible, hairy toes, like those of geckos, that can adjust quickly to accommodate shifting weight and slippery surfaces.\n\nBiologists from the University of California, Berkeley, and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics observed geckos running horizontally along walls to learn how they use their five toes to compensate for different types of surfaces without slowing down.\n\n\"The research helped answer a fundamental question: Why have many toes?\" said Robert Full, UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology.\n\nAs his previous research showed, geckos' toes can stick to the smoothest surfaces through the use of intermolecular forces, and uncurl and peel in milliseconds. Their toes have up to 15,000 hairs per foot, and each hair has \"an awful case of split ends, with as many as a thousand nano-sized tips that allow close surface contact,\" he said.\n\nThese discoveries have spawned research on new types of adhesives that use intermolecular forces, or van der Waals forces, to stick almost anywhere, even underwater.\n\nOne puzzle, he said, is that gecko toes only stick in one direction. They grab when pulled in one direction, but release when peeled in the opposite direction. Yet, geckos move agilely in any orientation.\n\nTo determine how geckos have learned to deal with shifting forces as they move on different surfaces, Yi Song, a UC Berkeley visiting student from Nanjing, China, ran geckos sideways along a vertical wall while making high-speed video recordings to show the orientation of their toes. The sideways movement allowed him to distinguish downward gravity from forward running forces to best test the idea of toe compensation.\n\nUsing a technique called frustrated total internal reflection, Song, also measured the area of contact of each toe. The technique made the toes light up when they touched a surface.\n\nTo the researcher's surprise, geckos ran sideways just as fast as they climbed upward, easily and quickly realigning their toes against gravity. The toes of the front and hind top feet during sideways wall-running shifted upward and acted just like toes of the front feet during climbing.\n\nTo further explore the value of adjustable toes, researchers added slippery patches and strips, as well as irregular surfaces. To deal with these hazards, geckos took advantage of having multiple, soft toes. The redundancy allowed toes that still had contact with the surface to reorient and distribute the load, while the softness let them conform to rough surfaces.\n\n\"Toes allowed agile locomotion by distributing control among multiple, compliant, redundant structures that mitigate the risks of moving on challenging terrain,\" Full said. \"Distributed control shows how biological adhesion can be deployed more effectively and offers design ideas for new robot feet, novel grippers and unique manipulators.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508133800.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T17:38:00", "title": "Data science drives new maps to predict the growth of cities over next century", "text": "University of Delaware data scientist Jing Gao is fascinated by the ways that cities and towns grow over time. This concept is known as urbanization.\n\nTake Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. All of these are cities, but they each grow differently, in terms of how the city's land areas expand. The same is true globally, from New Delhi, India, to Paris, France.\n\nGao, an assistant professor of geography and spatial sciences in UD's College of Earth, Ocean and Environment, and collaborator Brian O'Neill, a UD alumnus and professor from the University of Denver, have created a new global simulation model to predict how urban land will change over the next 100 years under different social and economic conditions.\n\nThe research leverages data science and machine learning to provide a first long-term look at how urbanization will unfold -- decade by decade.\n\nThe researchers describe their simulations in a paper published in the journal Nature Communications on Friday, May 8.\n\nData science helps long-term forecasting\n\nAccording to Gao, until recently it has been difficult to generate long-term, global forecasts of urban expansion. This is because while urbanization is a global trend, the way cities develop (buildings, roads, people, economics) can change over time. Additionally, this development can vary widely country to country, and even within different parts of the same country.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTo understand how this change occurs, Gao and O'Neill used data science to analyze 15 global data sets depicting various aspects of urbanization, including a newly available global map series showing urban land change over the past 40 years based on satellite images of Earth. The global maps are accurate to within approximately 125 feet (38 meters) and provide a uniquely detailed look at past urban development that was not previously possible with this degree of specificity.\n\n\"Mining historical data revealed that there are three different urbanization styles: urbanized, steadily urbanizing and rapidly urbanizing,\" Gao said. \"And countries evolve from rapidly urbanizing to steadily urbanizing to urbanized over time.\"\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the United States and most western European countries are already urbanized. India and China, which previously experienced rapid development, have now transitioned to steadily urbanizing. Rapidly urbanizing countries at present include many countries in Africa.\n\nAnd here's the data science part. Understanding these broad styles is not enough to capture -- globally -- how urbanization is playing out on the ground at a local scale.\n\nTo do this, the researchers divided the world into 375 small regions and ran a unique model for each region simultaneously, then pieced results from all models together to develop a global map. This information can shed light on how our cities may change and reveal potential impacts of urbanization that can inform local to global urban planners and policymakers.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe research team's projections show that the total amount of urban areas on Earth can grow anywhere from 1.8 to 5.9-fold by 2100. On average, if past urbanization trends continue, the world will build approximately 618,000 square miles (1.6 million square kilometers) of new urban areas globally over the century. This is an area roughly 4.5 times the size of Germany, or, more than 225 million football fields.\n\nHow this urban expansion occurs, however, largely depends on societal trends in the years to come. This includes trends in economic growth, population change and lifestyle habits, and what level of consideration is given to how our habits affect the environment.\n\nFor both developed and developing countries, for example, countries in Europe and Southeast Asia, urban expansion is expected to roughly triple if society favors materialistic and fossil-fuel driven development instead of adopting a sustainability mindset.\n\nIn the U.S., the least urban expansion occurs if people are focused on sustainability, such as green development and environmental awareness. In this case, urban land is expected to grow by 1.3 times by 2100. But if people favor highly materialistic development over the same timeframe, with high consumption of fossil fuels and a material-driven society, sprawl-like urban expansion is expected, with close to four times the amount of expansion the U.S. had at the beginning of the century.\n\nThe U.S. already is among the countries with the largest amount of developed land, so four-fold growth in urban expansion is a lot.\n\n\"This is where our projections can inform policy and planning,\" said Gao. \"These projections can help researchers and analysts understand how large-scale changes that occur over a long time period, such as climate change, may affect local urban areas.\"\n\nMost individuals do not realize how changes to the landscape, such as buildings and roads, may affect their lives. In Delaware, for example, second homes being built near the coast often come at the cost of agricultural farmland. While these developments may increase an area's economic prosperity, they can have other unintended consequences, such as increased potential exposure to coastal flooding and sea level rise.\n\nAnd, no matter what socio-economic scenario was selected, the simulations show that most countries will become urbanized by the end of the century.\n\nOne interesting finding from the work is that although prevailing thought is that urbanization is primarily happening in the developing world, Gao said this may not be the case.\n\n\"If you look at the data collected over the past 40 years, the absolute amount of new urban land construction in the developed world is comparable to the developing world,\" she said. \"However, the changes seem faster in the developing world because there currently is much less developed land there, so the rate of change appears greater.\"\n\nThis begs the question: as developing countries in Africa continue to grow, will they ever catch up to or surpass developed countries like the United States in terms of urbanized land?\n\n\"According to today's definition, Africa is expected to become urbanized by 2100,\" said Gao. \"But even if it continues developing at a very fast rate relative to the rest of the world throughout the century, it won't catch up to developed countries like the U.S. because the difference at the outset is large and the developed world still keeps expanding its urban area.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508112924.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T15:29:24", "title": "Controlling quantumness: Simulations reveal details about how particles interact", "text": "In everyday life, matter behaves in a predictable, expected way. If you throw a ball, you assume it will travel in a certain direction and have a predictable recoil. What's more, forces exerted on one object would not have an impact on another, independent object.\n\nBut in quantum mechanics -- the physics of the tiny -- the rules are completely different. In one, two, and three-particle systems, actions that happen in one spot can strongly influence atoms far away. Scientists don't yet have a full understanding of this but, by analyzing the behavior of these systems and more complex ones, they are hoping to find insights.\n\nResearchers from the Quantum Systems Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), alongside collaborators at University College Dublin and Durham University, simulated one of these systems, which revealed quantum states -- ways that particles arrange themselves in isolated systems -- that were unexpected. Their results, published in New Journal of Physics, could have applications for quantum technologies.\n\n\"If you throw a stone off a boat, the stone goes one way and the boat goes the other,\" explained Professor Thomas Busch, who leads the Unit. \"In quantum mechanics, we can have much stronger correlations at much greater distances. It's like if you put on one red sock and one green sock, then someone in Antarctica, who you've never met, would have to do the same. And our work has found new states with these very strong correlations, which can be controlled very well.\"\n\nExperimenting with two atoms\n\nWhen scientists research macroscopic systems, they tend to look at many particles -- say 10 to the 23 atoms. Because there are so many, they can't follow every atom and must make assumptions. To avoid this, the researchers in this study used another option.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"We simulated a system with just two atoms,\" said first author Ayaka Usui, a Ph.D. student in the Unit. \"This provided a building block of the larger system, but we could control everything and see exactly what was happening. And, to further control this system, we considered super-cold atoms.\"\n\nAt room temperature, particles move around very quickly. The warmer it is, the faster they move. By using laser cooling, these atoms can be slowed and cooled down until they reach almost zero velocity and are thus super-cold. This made it much easier for Ayaka and colleagues to describe them in their simulations.\n\nIn a system like this, the simplest thing the particles can do is collide with each other. This forces them to move around and change direction, but particles also have something called spin. The spin of a particle is either pointing up or down and further influences how it moves -- an effect called spin-orbit coupling. When the researchers simulated a system with two super-cold atoms that were spin-orbit coupled, these new states, with their very strong correlations, were revealed.\n\n\"We have the systems with two-particles where you get these states and the ones with 10 to the 23 where you don't,\" said Dr. Thomas Fogarty, Postdoctoral Scholar in the Unit. \"Somewhere along this long chain of adding particles, these new states go away.\"\n\nEngineering further insights\n\n\"Alongside the new states, we've discovered the formulas that describe this system exactly,\" said Ayaka. \"So now, we can engineer it.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nBy finding these formulas, the researchers have control over the system and they now plan on changing the parameters to look at the system's dynamics.\n\n\"We're going to split the system, so we have two of them,\" said Ayaka. \"We can use the strong correlations to help us measure the system. If we find one atom in one of the systems, we know the other one is also in that one, without measuring it, because they are tightly correlated.\"\n\nAlthough this research is just concentrating on a small aspect of what quantum mechanics can do, it has numerous applications, said Professor Busch.\n\n\"Quantum technologies need these correlations,\" he explained. \"These new states have the strongest non-classical correlations that we know, and we can engineer them. With this research, we could build more powerful computers. We could create measurement devices that measure tiny differences in gravity or electric pulses in the brain.

However, there is a problem in the extraction method, which is both unsustainable and harmful to the environment.\n\n\"Our new method takes crustacean waste and discarded fruit waste and uses natural fermentation processes to extract chitin. This is not only cost-effective, but also environmentally-friendly and sustainable, and helps to reduce overall waste,\" said Prof Chen.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe team's findings were published in peer-reviewed journal AMB Express in January 2020.\n\nThe NTU team tested ten sources of common fruit waste such as white and red grape pomace, mango and apple peels, and pineapple cores, in various fermentation experiments. They found that fruit waste contained enough sugar content to power the fermentation process that breaks prawn shells down into chitin.\n\nThey used 'X-ray diffraction' technique to determine the atomic and molecular structure of the chitin created using the new method and its level of purity was measured using a 'crystallinity index'. The extracted crude chitin samples from prawn shells fermented using fruit waste gave a crystallinity index of 98.16 per cent, which compared to commercial chitin samples with an index of 87.56 per cent. The fermentation process using the sugar content from the fruit waste produced higher quality chitin than the commercial one.\n\nProf Chen said, \"Our research has led to not only higher quality chitin but a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly process too. While the various types of fruit waste produced good results, the sugar from the pomace of red grapes had the best performance. This is also a cost-effective method for industry-scale operations, which could be of potential interest to wineries looking to reduce and upcycle their waste.\"\n\n\"This research also echoes NTU's translational research focus, which aims to develop sustainable innovations that benefit society and industry and create a greener future.\"\n\nMr Loo Yuen Meng, Managing Director of Integrated Aqua Singapore Pte.

Through a simple fermentation process, the high-value chitin and chitosan recovered from the prawn shells are environment-friendly, and the products can be re-connected back to the food industry.\"\n\nBy leaving chitin to undergo further stages of fermentation the NTU research team also found they could ferment it further into chitosan, which can be used as a growth enhancer in plant fertilisers, or as a controlled drug delivery system in pharmaceutical treatments.\n\nThe NTU team is now exploring ways to use chitosan to enhance previous research innovations such as food packaging created using soybean residue or Okara. This could potentially lead to the development of a more durable cellulose film with anti-microbial and anti-bacterial properties.\n\nProf Chen is also working with multiple companies to spur the adoption of greener industrial methods in producing chitin and chitosan.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508112917.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T15:29:17", "title": "Our pupils move to the rhythm of the environment", "text": "When we find something particularly beautiful or impressive, we literally get big eyes: Our pupils dilate. The pupil controls how much light enters the eye and falls on the retina. When there is a lot of light, the pupil contracts; when there is little light, it opens again. Neuroscientists from the German Primate Center (DPZ) -- Leibniz Institute for Primate Research and the European Neuroscience Institute G\u00f6ttingen have now found out in a study of humans and rhesus monkeys that the movement of the pupil is not only reflexively controlled by the amount of incident light, but unconsciously also by our mind. Thus, the pupil can follow rhythms that arise in the environment. In this way, the opening of the pupil is optimally adapted to our environment which enhances perception (Journal of Neuroscience).\n\nSensory impressions from our environment are often rhythmic, not only when we hear, but also when we see. For example, the blue light of a passing ambulance flashes about 120 times per minute. We also react unconsciously to visual events in our environment, which can be registered by our senses as regular patterns. From these patterns our brain can, for example, deduce when the next flash of blue light will hit the eye and prepare itself for it.\n\nAn important factor in vision is the adjustment of the pupil diameter. Smaller pupils provide a sharper image, while larger pupils allow more light to reach the retina, making it more likely that even weak stimuli will be processed at all. Pupil diameter is controlled by the pupillary reflex, which automatically, i.e. without our knowledge or intention, adjusts the pupil muscles to the incidence of light. But not all relevant environmental information is contained in the amount of incident light alone. Computations are therefore required in the brain that go beyond the capabilities of a reflex to take into account all available information. The aim of this study, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), was to find out whether and to what extent pupil dynamics are controlled fully automatically or whether they are also influenced by more complex rhythms in the environment.\n\nFor the investigations, pupil movements of two male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and several test subjects of both sexes were measured using a high-speed video camera, while the subjects were shown sequences of images of human faces at a temporal frequency of two hertz. A dark background was shown between the images. The alternation of background and image causes the pupil to dilate and contract in rhythm with the images. During the experiments, the order of the images was manipulated -- they were grouped in pairs so that a particular image always followed a particular other image. Thus, there are two rhythms to which the pupil reacts: a fast one (two hertz), which results from the alternation of image and background, and one at half that pace (one hertz), which results from the arrangement of the images as pairs. The sequence of the pairs is not given by the light itself, and therefore requires an additional computation of environmental rhythms in the brain. Since the luminance of the faces in all pictures as well as the dark background in the \"pauses\" remained unchanged, but the arrangement of the pictures varied, conclusions could be drawn about the influence of this additional computation on pupil dynamics.\n\nIn addition to the structured sequence, randomly arranged images with the same frequency (two hertz) were shown. A comparison of the results between structured and unstructured image sequences at the same image frequency shows that in both species studied the pupil follows not only the light-related rhythm of the images, but also the more complex rhythm of the pairs. Pupil movement in a slow (one hertz) rhythm keeps the pupil open longer, as if a pair should not be interrupted by the closing of the pupil. This allows more light to reach the retina. \"The additional information contained in the environment thus complements the information already reaching the retina via the incident light,\" says Caspar Schwiedrzik, head of the junior research group \"Perception and Plasticity.\" Furthermore, the study was able to show that this contributes to an improvement in perception, even if the test subjects are not aware that there is a rhythm in the environment. \"Pupil control is therefore not purely reflexive, but is also influenced by our unconscious thoughts,\" adds Schwiedrzik.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508112915.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T15:29:15", "title": "More selective elimination of leukemia stem cells and blood stem cells", "text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer of the blood-forming system. It affects the hematopoietic stem cells, or blood stem cells, of various white blood cells and of the red blood cells and platelets. The leukemic stem cells propagate quickly, spread in the bone marrow and blood, and can attack other organs. Patients are usually treated with intensive chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy. After that they require a transplant of hematopoietic stem cells from a healthy donor. There are serious side effects associated with the treatment and it is therefore unsuitable for many patients.\n\nSelectively eliminating leukemic and hematopoietic stem cells\n\nA team of scientists and physicians from the University of Zurich (UZH), the University Hospital Zurich (USZ) and ETH Zurich have now managed to eliminate the leukemic and hematopoietic stem cells more selectively in an animal model. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy not only destroy the cancerous and hematopoietic stem cells, but affect all dividing cells -- i.e. practically all tissues. \"Compared to normal strategies, our method works very selectively, meaning that mature blood cells and other tissues are spared,\" says study leader Markus Manz, professor of medicine at UZH and director of the Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology at USZ.\n\nThe researchers used the novel cell therapy called CAR-T. This therapy uses genetic modification to equip human immune cells with a receptor, thanks to which they can systematically dock onto only the leukemic stem cells and the healthy hematopoietic stem cells and destroy them. This creates space for the new donor cells to be transplanted. To avoid that the genetically modified immune cells then also attack the hematopoietic stem cells from the donor, the CAR-T cells are deactivated after they have done their work and before the transplant. This is done by using an antibody against a surface marker of the CAR-T cells. After the donor stem cell transplant, they take their place in the bone marrow and begin to rebuild the hematopoietic and immune system.\n\nClinical use of selective immune-mediated elimination planned\n\nThe results were achieved using cell cultures in the lab and in mice with human blood and cancer cells. But Markus Manz is confident that the treatment could also be effective in humans: \"The principle works: It is possible to eliminate, with high precision, the leukemic and hematopoietic stem cells in a living organism.\" Researchers are currently testing whether the method is only possible with CAR-T cells or also with simpler constructs -- such as T-cell-activating antibodies. As soon as the pre-clinical work is completed, Manz wants to test the new immunotherapy in a clinical study with humans. \"If our method also works with humans, it could replace chemotherapy with its serious side effects, which would be a great benefit for patients with acute myeloid leukemia or other hematopoietic stem cell diseases,\" explains Manz.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508112913.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T15:29:13", "title": "Chemistry breakthrough could speed up drug development", "text": "Scientists have successfully developed a new technique to reliably grow crystals of organic soluble molecules from nanoscale droplets, unlocking the potential of accelerated new drug development.\n\nChemistry experts from Newcastle and Durham universities, working in collaboration with SPT Labtech, have grown the small crystals from nanoscale encapsulated droplets.

This is shown by a recent study by the University of Bonn. The shredder, known as gamma-secretase, is considered a possible target for drugs against cancer and Alzheimer's disease. However, the results suggest that such agents may have long-range effects that need to be watched closely. The study has now been published in the journal \"Life Science Alliance.\"\n\nEvery cell in the body is surrounded by a fatty film called the plasma membrane. It also contains numerous proteins that span the membrane from outside to inside and act as sensors for the cell: When they encounter certain molecules on the outside, they generate a signal on the inside of the membrane, thereby regulating certain reactions within the cell. Other membrane proteins are able to transport certain substances into the cell.\n\nGamma-secretase plays an important role in the release of membrane-anchored signaling proteins. But it is also a \"cleaning specialist\" for discarded membrane proteins: It breaks down the proteins within the cell membrane for further disposal. With this function, the secretase has been in the focus of Alzheimer's research for almost two decades: Many brain cells contain a protein called APP in their membrane. When gamma-secretase breaks down APP, one of the fragments is released into the brain fluid: the so-called Abeta peptide. This peptide is the main constituent of the plaques found in the damaged brain areas of Alzheimer's patients. \"Originally, it was therefore hoped that the inhibition of gamma-secretase could slow down Alzheimer's disease,\" explains Prof. Dr. Jochen Walter. \"Unfortunately, that hasn't proved successful so far.\"\n\nWaste in the membrane\n\nIt is now known that gamma secretase exerts important roles in the functioning of cells. If it fails, cellular membranes gradually fills up with waste. This could for instance impair the effective uptake of certain molecules into the cells. The current study shows serious consequences of such a failure. The APP also plays a key role here: \"When we inhibit gamma secretase in cell cultures, APP accumulates in the membranes,\" explains Walter's colleague Dr. Esteban Gutierrez. \"This in turn hinders the absorption of so-called lipoproteins from the environment.\"\n\nThis mechanism triggers a fatal process. Lipoproteins are particles of proteins and fat-like molecules, the lipids. If too few of them enter the cell, the cell suspects a lipid deficiency. To remedy this, the cell increases its own lipid synthesis. \"We have shown that inhibition of the causes a strong activation of a central regulator of lipid synthesis called LXR,\" says Gutierrez. The lipids are partially transported out of the cell; however, due to the disturbed lipoprotein uptake, the cell does not receive feedback that this measure was successful and continues to produce more lipids. This means that numerous fat droplets accumulate inside the cell over time. In excessive quantities, this leads to adiposis in the cell interior, which can disrupt important cellular functions.\n\n\"Other studies have already shown that a disruption of the lipid metabolism in the brain can also contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease,\" explains Prof. Walter. \"Our study points to a mechanism by which this could happen.\" The inhibition of gamma secretase may therefore cause an opposite effect one would expect from this measure.\n\nInhibition of secretase hinders the division of cancer cells\n\nHowever, it is more promising in another context -- the fight against cancer. The cell membrane contains proteins that stimulate cell division. If gamma-secretase is inactivated in tumor cells, these proteins are no longer released from the membrane, and thus, the cancer cells can no longer replicate as quickly. \"In this case, too, the treatment causes side effects,\" Walter emphasizes. \"As long as they are mainly confined to cancer cells, this is probably not a major problem; nevertheless, one should keep an eye on them.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508112906.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T15:29:06", "title": "Human-driven pollution alters the environment even underground", "text": "The Monte Conca cave system on the island of Sicily is a vast system of springs and pools, sitting below a nature preserve.

Her brain had formed a deep, lasting connection between loud sounds and the devastating sight she witnessed.\n\nThis story, relayed by clinical psychiatrist and co-author of a new study Mohsin Ahmed, MD, PhD, is a powerful example of the brain's powerful ability to remember and connect events separated in time. And now, in that new study in mice published today in Neuron, scientists at Columbia's Zuckerman Institute have shed light on how the brain can form such enduring links.\n\nThe scientists uncovered a surprising mechanism by which the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory, builds bridges across time: by firing off bursts of activity that seem random, but in fact make up a complex pattern that, over time, help the brain learn associations. By revealing the underlying circuitry behind associative learning, the findings lay the foundation for a better understanding of anxiety and trauma- and stressor-related disorders, such as panic and post-traumatic stress disorders, in which a seemingly neutral event can elicit a negative response.\n\n\"We know that the hippocampus is important in forms of learning that involve linking two events that happen even up to 10 to 30 seconds apart,\" said Attila Losonczy, MD, PhD, a principal investigator at Columbia's Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute and the paper's co-senior author. \"This ability is a key to survival, but the mechanisms behind it have proven elusive. With today's study in mice, we have mapped the complex calculations the brain undertakes in order to link distinct events that are separated in time.\"\n\nThe hippocampus -- a small, seahorse-shaped region buried deep in the brain -- is an important headquarters for learning and memory. Previous experiments in mice showed that disruption to the hippocampus leaves the animals with trouble learning to associate two events separated by tens of seconds.\n\n\"The prevailing view has been that cells in the hippocampus keep up a level of persistent activity to associate such events,\" said Dr. Ahmed, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, and co-first author of today's study. \"Turning these cells off would thus disrupt learning.\"\n\nTo test this traditional view, the researchers imaged parts of the hippocampus of mice as the animals were exposed to two different stimuli: a neutral sound followed by a small but unpleasant puff of air. A fifteen-second delay separated the two events. The scientists repeated this experiment across several trials. Over time, the mice learned to associate the tone with the soon-to-follow puff of air. Using advanced two-photon microscopy and functional calcium imaging, they recorded the activity of thousands of neurons, a type of brain cell, in the animals' hippocampus simultaneously over the course of each trial for many days.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"With this approach, we could mimic, albeit in a simpler way, the process our own brains undergo when we learn to connect two events,\" said Dr. Losonczy, who is also a professor of neuroscience at Columbia's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.\n\nTo make sense of the information they collected, the researchers teamed up with computational neuroscientists who develop powerful mathematical tools to analyze vast amounts of experimental data.\n\n\"We expected to see repetitive, continuous neural activity that persisted during the fifteen-second gap, an indication of the hippocampus at work linking the auditory tone and the air puff,\" said computational neuroscientist Stefano Fusi, PhD, a principal investigator at Columbia's Zuckerman Institute and the paper's co-senior author. \"But when we began to analyze the data, we saw no such activity.\"\n\nInstead, the neural activity recorded during the fifteen-second time gap was sparse. Only a small number of neurons fired, and they did so seemingly at random. This sporadic activity looked distinctly different from the continuous activity that the brain displays during other learning and memory tasks, like memorizing a phone number.\n\n\"The activity appears to come in fits and bursts at intermittent and random time periods throughout the task,\" said James Priestley, a doctoral candidate co-mentored by Drs. Losonczy and Fusi at Columbia's Zuckerman Institute and the paper's co-first author. \"To understand activity, we had to shift the way we analyzed data and use tools designed to make sense of random processes.\"\n\nUltimately, the researchers discovered a pattern in the randomness: a style of mental computing that seems to be a remarkably efficient way that neurons store information. Instead of communicating with each other constantly, the neurons save energy -- perhaps by encoding information in the connections between cells, called synapses, rather than through the electrical activity of the cells.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"We were happy to see that the brain doesn't maintain ongoing activity over all these seconds because, metabolically, that's not the most efficient way to store information,\" said Dr. Fusi, who is also a professor of neuroscience at Columbia's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. \"The brain seems to have a more efficient way to build this bridge, which we suspect may involve changing the strength of the synapses.\"\n\nIn addition to helping to map the circuitry involved in associative learning, these findings also provide a starting point to more deeply explore disorders involving dysfunctions in associative memory, such as panic and pos-ttraumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"While our study does not explicitly model the clinical syndromes of either of these disorders, it can be immensely informative,\" said Dr. Ahmed, who is also a member of the Losonczy lab at Columbia's Zuckerman Institute. \"For example, it can help us to model some aspects of what may be happening in the brain when patients experience a fearful association between two events that would, to someone else, not elicit fright or panic.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508112901.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T15:29:01", "title": "Fishing can disrupt mating systems", "text": "In many fish species body size plays an important role in sexual selection. Large individuals are preferred mating partners because they can enhance offspring survival by providing better quality resources than small individuals. While large females and males are often favored by sexual selection, fishing targets and removes these reproductively superior individuals. Academy Research Fellow Silva Uusi-Heikkil\u00e4 discusses in her recent literature review the implications fisheries selection might have on sexual selection, individual reproductive success and population viability.\n\nSexual selection depends on the advantage certain individuals have over other conspecifics. It creates important filters for reproductive success and can consequently increase fitness and population viability. A large male can provide more intensive care for the developing offspring than small male and is therefore preferred by a female. A large female salmon, on the other hand, is more fecund than a small one and attracts multiple males. Sexual selection in fish have been studied using model species, such as guppy, zebrafish and three-spine stickleback.\n\n- Zebrafish female prefers a large male as a mating partner and releases more eggs for him compared to a small male. In some species females also produce higher quality eggs towards large males, says Academy Fellow Silva Uusi-Heikkil\u00e4 from the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4.\n\nFisheries often remove the largest individuals from the population, thus operates in the opposite direction than sexual selection. The effects of fisheries selection on sexual selection has received relatively little attention.\n\n- Studying mate choice in natural conditions can be challenging, says Uusi-Heikkil\u00e4.\n\nTherefore, the mating systems of many commercially valuable fish species are poorly known, perhaps excluding cod and salmon. Experimental studies have revealed a great deal about cod mating systems. Salmon, on the other hand, spawn in their home rivers, where it is easier to observe mate choice and mate competition compared to the great depths of the oceans where many commercially important fish species spawn.\n\nUusi-Heikkil\u00e4 points out that we should focus more on how size-selective fisheries affect fish mating systems, how persistent these effects are and how this might affect population growth, viability and resilience.\n\n- Large females and males often have higher reproductive success than small ones. Thus, size-selective fisheries may impair population growth. It is tempting to think that sexual selection could buffer the adverse effects of fishing and rescue exploited populations. This is not going to happen, if there are now large females and males left. Overall, if fishing reduces body size variation in a population, sexual selection cannot operate effectively, concludes Uusi-Heikkil\u00e4.\n\nThe study was funded by the Academy of Finland.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508112856.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T15:28:56", "title": "Neanderthals were choosy about making bone tools", "text": "Evidence continues to mount that the Neanderthals, who lived in Europe and Asia until about 40,000 years ago, were more sophisticated people than once thought. A new study from UC Davis shows that Neanderthals chose to use bones from specific animals to make a tool for specific purpose: working hides into leather.\n\nNaomi Martisius, research associate in the Department of Anthropology, studied Neanderthal tools from sites in southern France for her doctoral research. The Neanderthals left behind a tool called a lissoir, a piece of animal rib with a smoothed tip used to rub animal hides to make them into leather. These lissoirs are often worn so smooth that it's impossible to tell which animal they came from just by looking at them.\n\nMartisius and colleagues used highly sensitive mass spectrometry to look at residues of collagen protein from the bones. The method is called ZooMS, or Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry. The technique breaks up samples into fragments that can be identified by their mass to charge ratio and used to reconstruct the original molecule.\n\nNormally, this method would involve drilling a sample from the bone. To avoid damaging the precious specimens, Martisius and colleagues were able to lift samples from the plastic containers in which the bones had been stored and recover enough material to perform an analysis.\n\nFavoring bovine ribs over deer\n\nThe results show that the bones used to make lissoirs mostly came from animals in the cattle family, such as bison or aurochs (a wild relative of modern cattle that is now extinct). But other animal bones from the same deposit show that reindeer were much more common and frequently hunted for food. So the Neanderthals were choosing to use only ribs from certain types of animals to make these tools.\n\n\"I think this shows that Neanderthals really knew what they were doing,\" Martisius said. \"They were deliberately picking up these larger ribs when they happened to come across these animals while hunting and they may have even kept these rib tools for a long time, like we would with a favorite wrench or screwdriver.\"\n\nBovine ribs are bigger and more rigid than deer ribs, making them better suited for the hard work of rubbing skins without wearing out or breaking.\n\n\"Neanderthals knew that for a specific task, they needed a very particular tool.

Microcrystallites of luminescent organic compounds can act as tiny laser sources for such devices, for example for use in displays and other components. Dendrimers offer numerous advantages as luminescent materials, however so far they have not been used as microcrystallites owing to their fragility and poor crystallinity. Now a team of researchers has produced dendrimers that form robust crystals with lasing properties. Their findings are published in Angewandte Chemie.\n\nDendrimers are polymers that grow out from a core through the addition of small molecules to form extended branches -- which explains their name, derived from the Greek word for tree. Dendrimers have many advantages that make them interesting luminescent materials. They are highly soluble, which makes them easy to incorporate into systems; they have high quantum yields, meaning you get a lot of the light you put in back again; they are good at harvesting light; and they tend to show relatively low luminescence loss when condensed into a solid.\n\nThe researchers made a family of dendrimers -- getting larger in size as the generation number increased -- made up of carbazole units forming the branches around a highly fluorescent core. The dendrimers formed stable single crystals even when the solvent was removed, and could be analyzed by single crystal X-ray analysis. In fact, the third generation dendrimer, which has a molecular weight of 4,600 Da, is the largest organic dendrimer ever to have been analyzed in this way.\n\n\"Our dendrimers have two key parts,\" study corresponding author Professor Yohei Yamamoto explains. \"The branches are made up of aromatic molecules that act as light harvesting antennas, collecting light made up of waves in many different planes, which is known as non-polarized light. This light is then transferred to the fluorescent core, whose structure leads to polarized light -- light with waves in a single plane -- being generated.\"\n\nWhen the dendrimer crystals were subjected to strong optical pumping -- the process used to amplify the signal in laser materials -- they produced amplified spontaneous emission and lasing with little damage to the structure of the material or the optical properties.\n\n\"The family of dendrimers we produced remedies a number of issues that have prevented the properties of these materials being exploited. We therefore expect them to make a significant contribution to the development of organic materials for laser optics,\" says Professor Yamamoto. \"The robust properties and laser emission of the crystals will be useful for components such as full-color optical displays and micro-optical circuits.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508083551.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T12:35:51", "title": "Canadian study finds temperature, latitude not associated with COVID-19 spread: School closures, physical distancing and public health measures have effect", "text": "Temperature and latitude do not appear to be associated with the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), according to a study of many countries published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal), but school closures and other public health measures are having a positive effect.\n\n\"Our study provides important new evidence, using global data from the COVID-19 epidemic, that these public health interventions have reduced epidemic growth,\" says Dr. Peter J\u00fcni, Institute for Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, and St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario.\n\nThe Canadian study looked at 144 geopolitical areas -- states and provinces in Australia, the United States and Canada as well as various countries around the world -- and a total of more than 375 600 confirmed COVID-19 cases. China, Italy, Iran and South Korea were excluded because the virus was either waning in the case of China or in full disease outbreak at the time of the analysis in others.

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden now report that how the long-term use of these drugs could increase the risk of developing dementia. Their results are published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia.\n\n\"We've been able to show that proton pump inhibitors affect the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which plays a significant part in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease,\" says Taher Darreh-Shori, senior researcher at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet. \"Since there's no effective treatment for the disease, it's important to avoid risk factors. We therefore want to draw attention to this so that the drugs aren't used needlessly for a long time.\"\n\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) work by blocking the pumps that transport acidic hydrogen ions from the cells that form the mucosa. When the pumps are out of action, there is a reduction in acid and, ultimately, the corrosive damage it does to tissue. Population studies have previously shown higher rates of dementia in people using PPIs (see background material), but what form such a connection could take has remained unknown -- until now.\n\nFirst, the researchers used 3D computer simulations to examine how six PPI variants based on different active substances interacted with an enzyme called choline acetyletransferase, the function of which is to synthesize the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. As a neurotransmitter, acetylcholine is needed for passing signals among nerve cells, but this only works if enough of the substance is produced. The simulations showed that all the tested drugs were able to bind with the enzyme.\n\nThe researchers then analysed the effect of this binding. They found that all the drugs inhibited the enzyme, resulting in a reduced production of acetylcholine, where the stronger the binding, the stronger the inhibitory effect. Drugs based on the active substances omeprazole, esomeprazole, tenatoprazole and rabeprazole had the greatest affinity and were therefore the strongest inhibitors of the enzyme, while the variants pantoprazole and lansoprazole were the weakest (see illustration).\n\nComplementary studies are now needed to examine whether these laboratory observations represent what occurs in the body. However, Darreh-Shori is already advising against the overuse of PPIs.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Special care should be taken with the more elderly patients and those already diagnosed with dementia,\" he says. \"The same also applies to patients with muscle weakness diseases such as ALS, as acetylcholine is an essential motor neurotransmitter. In such cases, doctors should use the drugs that have the weakest effect and prescribe them at lowest dose and for as short a time as possible.\"\n\n\"I would, however, like to stress that the correct use of the drugs is safe also in the elderly, as long as the drugs are used for a limited time and when they're really needed, as our nervous system is pretty flexible when it comes to tolerating short-term impact,\" he adds.\n\nThe research was financed by several bodies, including the Alzheimer's Association (USA), the Swedish Research Council, the Loo & Hans Osterman Foundation and Karolinska Institutet.\n\nBackground material:\n\nA large population study in JAMA Neurology showed that people who use PPIs also ran a higher risk of dementia. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26882076\n\nA study in Alzheimers Research & Therapy showed that healthy young individuals who took PPIs for ten days performed worse on memory tests than previously, compared with a placebo group. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26714488\n\nAccording to a study published in PLOS ONE the use of PPIs in the population more than doubled from 4 to 9.2 percent between 2002 and 2009. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23418510", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508083547.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T12:35:47", "title": "How a molecular 'alarm' system in plants protects them from predators: Scientists uncover how oral secretions of the cotton leaf worm trigger defense responses in a plant", "text": "Some plants, like soybean, are known to possess an innate defense machinery that helps them develop resistance against insects trying to feed on them. However, exactly how these plants recognize signals from insects has been unknown until now. In a new study, scientists in Japan have uncovered the cellular pathway that helps these plants to sense danger signals and elicit a response, opening doors to a myriad of agricultural applications.\n\nIn nature, every species must be equipped with a strategy to be able to survive in response to danger. Plants, too, have innate systems that are triggered in response to a particular threat, such as insects feeding on them. For example, some plants sense \"herbivore-derived danger signals\" (HDS), which are specific chemicals in oral secretions of insects. This activates a cascade of events in the plant's defense machinery, which leads to the plant developing \"resistance\" to (or \"immunity\" against) the predator. But despite decades of research, exactly how plants recognize these signals has remained a bit of a mystery.\n\nIn a new study published in Communications Biology, a research team from Tokyo University of Science, Ehime University, Okayama University, The University of Tokyo, and Iwate Biotechnology Research Center, led by Prof Gen-ichiro Arimura, attempts to shed light on exactly how plant HDS systems work. They chose to study membrane proteins called \"receptor-like kinases\" (RLKs), which are found in soybean leaves. They based their study on previous evidence from plants like Arabidopsis, tobacco, and cowpea, in which RLKs play a major role in HDS systems. Prof Arimura says, \"Scientists have been trying to understand the molecular mechanism of plant resistance for years, but the 'sensors' involved in plant recognition of insect pests are still not known. Thus, we wanted to get a detailed understanding of these mechanisms.\"\n\nTo begin with, the scientists focused on soybean RLK genes that were structurally and functionally similar to a RLK gene, which is known to trigger a danger response by recognizing \"oligosaccharides\" (small carbohydrate molecules) during pathogen attack. They speculated that owing to these similarities, soybean genes might also show a mechanism similar to that seen in pathogen resistance. They found 15 such genes through genetic analysis. Next, the scientists generated 15 types of Arabidopsis plants, each plant uniquely expressing only one of the 15 individual soy genes. When they tested these plants using oral secretions from the pest, they uncovered genes for two novel RLKs that showed a defense response specific to the oral secretions, called GmHAK1 and GmHAK2. These findings were unprecedented: the role of these RLKs in soybean HDS systems had never been revealed before. Moreover, when the scientists dug deeper into the mechanism of these regulatory factors in Arabidopsis, they found two proteins, a HAK homolog and PBL27 (which play a role in intracellular signaling), to be involved in this pathway. Accordingly, this confirmed what the scientists had initially expected\u2015soybean and Arabidopsis possess similar mechanisms for \"danger response.\"\n\nIn agriculture, it is crucial to develop strategies for pest control in crop plants to avoid incurring losses. This study takes a massive step in this direction by uncovering an important cellular mechanism that triggers defense response in plants. Manipulating this innate cellular system may even help scientists to fuel the development of new agricultural products, potentially making life easier for farmers. Prof Arimura concludes, \"It has been challenging to find new pest control methods that are effective and do not harm the ecosystem in any way. Our study offers a potential solution to this problem by uncovering the details of how certain plants develop resistance.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200508083542.htm", "published": "2020-05-08T12:35:42", "title": "Computer vision helps scientists study lithium ion batteries", "text": "Lithium-ion batteries lose their juice over time, causing scientists and engineer to work hard to understand that process in detail. Now, scientists at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have combined sophisticated machine learning algorithms with X-ray tomography data to produce a detailed picture of how one battery component, the cathode, degrades with use.\n\nThe new study, published May 8 in Nature Communications, focused on how to better visualize what's going on in cathodes made of nickel-manganese-cobalt, or NMC. In these cathodes, NMC particles are held together by a conductive carbon matrix, and researchers have speculated that one cause of performance decline could be particles breaking away from that matrix. The team's goal was to combine cutting-edge capabilities at SLAC's Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) to develop a comprehensive picture of how NMC particles break apart and break away from the matrix and how that might contribute to performance losses.\n\nOf course, it's a tall order for humans to figure out what's going on just by looking at pictures of an NMC cathode, so the team turned to computer vision, a subfield of machine learning algorithms originally designed to scan images or videos and identify and track objects like dogs or cars.\n\nEven then, there were challenges. Computer vision algorithms often zero in on boundaries defined by light or dark lines, so they'd have a hard time differentiating between several small NMC particles stuck together and a single large but partially fractured one; to most computer vision systems, those fractures would look like clean breaks.\n\nTo address that problem, the team used a type of algorithm set up to deal with hierarchical objects -- for example, a jigsaw puzzle, which we would think of as a complete entity even though it's made up of many individual pieces. With input and judgments from the researchers themselves, they trained this algorithm to distinguish different kinds of particles and thus develop a three-dimensional picture of how NMC particles, whether large or small, fractured or not, break away from the cathode.\n\nThey discovered that particles detaching from the carbon matrix really do contribute significantly to a battery's decline, at least under conditions one would typically see in consumer electronics, such as smart phones.\n\nSecond, while large NMC particles are more likely to become damaged and break away, quite a few smaller particles break away, too, and overall, there's more variation in the way small particles behave, said Yijin Liu, a staff scientist at SLAC and a senior author of the new paper.

Their algorithm backmaps a large-scale model that includes features, such as membrane curvature, to its corresponding coarse-grained molecular model. This has allowed them to zoom in on toxin-induced membrane budding and to simulate a full-sized mitochondrial lipid membrane. Their approach, which was published in the journal Nature Communications on 8 May, opens the way to whole-cell simulations at a molecular level.\n\nMolecular dynamics simulations are a powerful tool to study the movements and interactions of atoms and molecules. However, in many biological processes, large-scale changes in, for example, membrane shape are important. 'These shape changes are of fundamental importance to the cell's functioning,' explains Siewert-Jan Marrink, Professor of Molecular Dynamics at the University of Groningen. 'However, the time and length scale of these membrane shape changes are too large for simulations at a molecular resolution.'\n\nChallenging\n\nEven though an increase in computing power allows more complex and longer simulations, cell structures such as mitochondria are still beyond reach. That is why the Molecular Dynamics group has developed an algorithm that links large-scale changes to molecular level simulations. For mitochondria, they started with an electron micrograph density map. The densities were translated into lipid structures and these were used as the input for a molecular dynamics simulation with the Coarse Grain (CG) Martini force field, previously developed by Marrink.\n\n'The difficult part is to place the lipids in the correct orientation in this density map, which is especially challenging in bent areas,' adds Wria Pezeshkian, a postdoctoral researcher in Marrink's team and co-author of the paper. The algorithm allows users to add different kinds of lipids to the membrane, at a realistic packing level. Using this approach, Marrink and his colleagues were able to simulate the entire lipid membrane of a mitochondrion for two nanoseconds. Pezeshkian: 'This structure contained more than five million lipids, which meant that the simulation had to deal with 80 million particles as each lipid molecule consists of multiple particles.'\n\nTriangles\n\nConsidering the size and shape, this simulation's complexity is larger than any simulation performed previously. 'A simulation of microseconds would have been possible but, as we had no information on the localization of the proteins in the mitochondrial membrane, it only contained lipids and is therefore unstable,' explains Marrink. Adding this extra complexity to the simulation is certainly possible and is currently in progress.\n\nInstead of a density map, the input for the system could also be a continuum model, which represents the membrane surface as triangles made up of nodes that are connected by 'springs'. Such a model can calculate forces generated by membrane deformation.

'And we could probably simulate a red blood cell.'\n\nA simple synthetic cell may soon be within reach.

Treatment with anticoagulants was associated with improved hospital survival among COVID-19 patients both in and out of the intensive care unit setting. Of the patients who did not survive, those on anticoagulants died after spending an average of 21 days in the hospital, compared to the non- anticoagulant patients who died after an average of 14 days in the hospital. The effect of anticoagulation had a more pronounced effect on ventilated patients -- 62.7 percent of intubated patients who were not treated with anticoagulants died, compared to 29.1 percent for intubated patients treated with anticoagulants. Of the intubated patients who did not survive, those with no anticoagulants died after 9 days, while those on anticoagulants died after 21 days.\n\nAll patients in the study had blood work done when they arrived at the hospital, which included measuring various inflammatory markers. The analysis of their records showed patients who received anticoagulants had higher inflammatory markers compared to patients not treated with anticoagulants. This may suggest patients with more severe illness may benefit from anticoagulants early on.\n\nThe observational study also explored the association of systemic anticoagulant treatment with bleeding events. Major bleeding was defined as 1) hemoglobin <7 g/dL and any red blood cell transfusion; 2) at least 2 units of red blood cell transfusion within 48 hours; or 3) a diagnosis code for major bleeding including intracranial hemorrhage; hematemesis; melena; peptic ulcer with hemorrhage; colon, rectal, or anal hemorrhage; hematuria; ocular hemorrhage; and acute hemorrhagic gastritis. Among those who did not receive anticoagulants, 38 (1.9 percent) patients had bleeding events, compared to 24 (3 percent) among those who received anticoagulants, p=0.2).\n\n\"We are hopeful that this report of the association of anticoagulation therapy with improved survival will be confirmed in future investigations. The astute scientists at Mount Sinai continue to analyze our data on COVID-19 patients in order to contribute to worldwide efforts to find effective treatments,\" says David Reich, MD, President and Chief Operating Officer of The Mount Sinai Hospital.\n\n\"As a cardiologist who has been on service caring for COVID-19 patients for the last three weeks, I have observed an increased amount of blood clot cases among hospitalized patients, so it is critical to look at whether anticoagulants provide benefits for them,\" says co-researcher Anu Lala, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"It's important to note that further analysis and prospective studies are required to determine the effectiveness for widespread use of anticoagulants in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\"\n\n\"This study is opening the door for a more extensive study that will be carried out with 5,000 COVID-19-positive patients, where we will evaluate the effectiveness of three types of antithrombotic therapy -- oral antithrombotic, subcutaneous heparin, and intravenous heparin -- and then perhaps engage our data for prospective clinical trials,\" says senior author Girish Nadkarni, MD, Co-Director of the Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center. \"We are excited about these preliminary results that may have a positive impact on COVID-19 patients and potentially give them a greater chance of survival, although more studies are needed.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507164007.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T20:40:07", "title": "Prediction tool shows how forest thinning may increase Sierra Nevada snowpack", "text": "The forest of the Sierra Nevada mountains is an important resource for the surrounding communities in Nevada and California. Thinning the forest by removing trees by hand or using heavy machinery is one of the few tools available to manage forests. However, finding the best way to thin forests by removing select trees to maximize the forest's benefits for water quantity, water quality, wildfire risk and wildlife habitat remains a challenge for resource managers. The U.S. Forest Service is leading an effort to balance all these challenges in landscape-scale forest restoration planning as part of the Lake Tahoe West Restoration Partnership.\n\nAs part of this effort, University of Nevada, Reno's Adrian Harpold recently led a team in developing a modeling tool to focus on the issue of water quantity. The tool predicts how different approaches to thinning the forest impact snowpack accumulation in Lake Tahoe, which controls how much water is available for downstream communities such as Reno.\n\n\"The snowpack we've relied upon is under pressure from years of fire suppression that increased tree density, combined with the effects of climate change and warming temperatures,\" Harpold, natural resources & environmental science assistant professor with the College of Agriculture, Biotechnology & Natural Resources, said.\n\nHe explained that too many trees means less snow reaches the ground. In addition, when many trees are clumped together, they warm up and release heat, which can melt the snow on the ground. However, too few trees means the snowpack is less protected from the sun and wind, which also melt snow.\n\nThe tool, developed with funding from the College's Experiment Station and the U.S. Forest Service, was built to specifically model the west shore of Lake Tahoe, which the team felt was a good sample of the Sierra Nevada forest. The team initially created a small-scale high-resolution model using data collected with 3D laser scanners, called \"LiDAR.\"\n\n\"The LiDAR data lets us see individual trees, which we use to 'virtually thin' the forest by taking trees out of the model,\" he said. \"As such, it lets us create a thinning experiment that's realistic. We can then represent different management actions, such as removing trees below certain heights.\"\n\nHis team, including the post-doctoral scholar Sebastian Krogh, graduate student Devon Eckberg, undergraduate students Makenzie Kohler and Gary Sterle, the College's Associate Professor of Remote Sensing Jonathan Greenberg and University of Arizona's Patrick Broxton, tested the model's accuracy by conducting thinning experiments and comparing the predictions to measurements in the real forest. Results were discussed in a recently published article on the proof-of-concept for using high-resolution modeling to predict the effect of forest thinning for snow, for which Harpold was the lead author.\n\nOnce the team determined the model was working correctly, they increased the model size to represent Lake Tahoe's western shore. Results are discussed in another recently published article on using the model to predict the effects of forest thinning on the northern Sierra Nevada snowpack, led by Krogh with Harpold, Broxton and the Forest Service's Patricia Manley as co-authors. Their experiments showed that overall, more trees removed means more snow maintained. However, there are beneficial ways and detrimental ways to remove trees. The method that appeared to be most effective was removing dense trees that had many leaves and branches and were shorter than about 50 feet, leaving behind taller trees. There were also differences in effectiveness depending on the elevation, the slope and the direction the slope was facing.\n\nHarpold plans to continue expanding the model, testing to see if it will work for Lake Tahoe's eastern shore and in the American River Basin, with the ultimate goal of providing a tool for Forest Service decision-makers and others to inform their forest-thinning plans.\n\nThe water-quantity tool is one of many different modeling tools being developed with funding from the Forest Service as part of the Tahoe-Central Sierra Initiative, which aims to quickly restore the forest to improve the health and resilience of Sierra Nevada mountains and maximize the benefits that the forest provides.\n\n\"My decision-support tool for water quantity would be a smaller piece in a larger toolkit to help determine how and where to thin the forests,\" Harpold said.\n\nOther tools being designed to predict forest-thinning impacts include a tool to predict impact on wildfire spread, a tool to predict impact on smoke, a tool to predict impact on endangered and threatened species, a tool to predict sediment flow into Lake Tahoe and a tool to predict economic impact.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507164005.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T20:40:05", "title": "Olanzapine may help control nausea, vomiting in patients with advanced cancer", "text": "Olanzapine, a generic drug used to treat nervous, emotional and mental conditions, also may help patients with advanced cancer successfully manage nausea and vomiting unrelated to chemotherapy.

Loprinzi and Navari found limited research regarding nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced cancer unrelated to chemotherapy, so they decided to conduct a clinical trial.\n\nThe colleagues, along with other collaborators, conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 30 patients with advanced cancer who had not recently received chemotherapy or radiation therapy but did have substantial trouble with nausea and vomiting. Researchers randomly assigned patients to receive a low-dose of olanzapine or a placebo daily. Neither the trial participants nor their clinicians knew whether participants were receiving olanzapine or a placebo.\n\nPrior to starting their medications on the first day of the study, participants rated their nausea over the previous 24 hours on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being none and 10 being as bad as it could be. Participants continued to rate their nausea every day at about the same time of day for the duration of the study.\n\nWhen the study was unblinded, the research team learned that all 30 participants recorded nausea scores of 8-10 on the first day of the study. After one day and one week, nausea scores in the 15 patients who received a placebo were all still 8-10 out of 10. In contrast, the 15 patients who received olanzapine had scores of 2-3 out of 10 after one day and 0-3 out of 10 after one week.

Now researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania say they know what's happening at the cellular level of the immune system when these cytokine storms occur, and the answer not only informs future potential Castleman therapies but may also provide new insight into why similar events take place in COVID-19 patients. The researchers published their findings today in the Journal of Clinical Investigation Insight. Castleman Disease isn't actually a single disease. The term describes a group of inflammatory disorders that share a common appearance under the microscope. It's diagnosed in about 5,000 people of all ages each year in the United States, which makes it roughly as common as Lou Gehrig's disease, also called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or ALS. Patients experience a range of symptoms -- from a single abnormal lymph node with mild flu-like symptoms to abnormal lymph nodes located throughout their entire body, abnormal blood cell counts, and life-threatening failure of multiple organ systems, such as the kidneys, liver, heart, and lungs. The most severe subtype, idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD), has similarities to autoimmune conditions, viral illnesses, and cancer. About 35 percent of patients with iMCD will die within five years of diagnosis.\n\n\"With iMCD, just as with COVID-19, it is the body's hyper-response that's deadly rather than the disease itself, and this study gives us new clues about why the immune cells are out of control and what we can do to rein them in,\" said the study's senior author David C. Fajgenbaum, MD, MBA, MSc, an assistant professor of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, director of the Center for Study & Treatment of Lymphadenopathies & Cytokine Storms, executive director of the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN), and a Castleman patient himself.\n\nFor this study, researchers took blood samples from iMCD patients who were asymptomatic and from those who were in flare to examine the differences in their immune cells. Previous research has shown the cytokine storm is tied to a cytokine, or inflammatory mediator, called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which in turn is connected to another pathway called mTOR. This study advanced these findings further and discovered a particular group of cytokines called Type-I Interferons are highly active when patients are in flare. They also found that another pathway called JAK seems to be a critical mediator of the cytokine storm.\n\n\"This deeper understanding of exactly what's causing the immune system's hyper-response strengthens the link between mTOR activation and cytokine storms, suggesting new treatment approaches for the patients in flare,\" said the study's lead author Ruth-Anne Langan Pai, a PhD candidate in Immunology and a member of the CDCN. Langan Pai performed the work as her doctoral thesis in Fajgenbaum's lab.\n\nThis alternative approach could address a vital clinical need. In 2014, the U.S Food and Drug Administration approved the drug siltuximab to treat iMCD, and studies have shown it can send between one-third and one-half of patients into a remission that generally lasts for years. However, patients who don't respond have limited options. They typically receive chemotherapy but often relapse.\n\nFajgenbaum and his team are currently testing treatment with mTOR inhibitors in a clinical trial (NCT03933904) at the University of Pennsylvania, with Sunita Nasta, MD, FACP, an associate professor of Hematology-Oncology, and Adam Cohen, MD, an assistant professor of Hematology-Oncology, enrolling and treating patients.\n\nFajgenbaum also says he hopes this work will prompt others in the field to consider different ways to approach the cytokine storms COVID-19 patients are experiencing.

This is where the teamwork of Juno, Hubble and Gemini comes into play.\n\nRadio 'Light Show'\n\nJupiter's constant storms are gigantic compared to those on Earth, with thunderheads reaching 40 miles from base to top -- five times taller than typical thunderheads on Earth -- and powerful lightning flashes up to three times more energetic than Earth's largest \"superbolts.\"\n\nLike lightning on Earth, Jupiter's lightning bolts act like radio transmitters, sending out radio waves as well as visible light when they flash across the sky.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEvery 53 days, Juno races low over the storm systems detecting radio signals known as \"sferics\" and \"whistlers,\" which can then be used to map lightning even on the day side of the planet or from deep clouds where flashes are not otherwise visible.\n\nCoinciding with each pass, Hubble and Gemini watch from afar, capturing high-resolution global views of the planet that are key to interpreting Juno's close-up observations. \"Juno's microwave radiometer probes deep into the planet's atmosphere by detecting high-frequency radio waves that can penetrate through the thick cloud layers. The data from Hubble and Gemini can tell us how thick the clouds are and how deep we are seeing into the clouds,\" Simon explained.\n\nBy mapping lightning flashes detected by Juno onto optical images captured of the planet by Hubble and thermal infrared images captured at the same time by Gemini, the research team has been able to show that lightning outbreaks are associated with a three-way combination of cloud structures: deep clouds made of water, large convective towers caused by upwelling of moist air -- essentially Jovian thunderheads -- and clear regions presumably caused by downwelling of drier air outside the convective towers.\n\nThe Hubble data show the height of the thick clouds in the convective towers, as well as the depth of deep water clouds. The Gemini data clearly reveal the clearings in the high-level clouds where it is possible to get a glimpse down to the deep water clouds.\n\nWong thinks that lightning is common in a type of turbulent area known as folded filamentary regions, which suggests that moist convection is occurring in them. \"These cyclonic vortices could be internal energy smokestacks, helping release internal energy through convection,\" he said. \"It doesn't happen everywhere, but something about these cyclones seems to facilitate convection.\"\n\nThe ability to correlate lightning with deep water clouds also gives researchers another tool for estimating the amount of water in Jupiter's atmosphere, which is important for understanding how Jupiter and the other gas and ice giants formed, and therefore how the solar system as a whole formed.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile much has been gleaned about Jupiter from previous space missions, many of the details -- including how much water is in the deep atmosphere, exactly how heat flows from the interior and what causes certain colors and patterns in the clouds -- remain a mystery. The combined result provides insight into the dynamics and three-dimensional structure of the atmosphere.\n\nSeeing a 'Jack-O-Lantern' Red Spot\n\nWith Hubble and Gemini observing Jupiter more frequently during the Juno mission, scientists are also able to study short-term changes and short-lived features like those in the Great Red Spot.\n\nImages from Juno as well as previous missions to Jupiter revealed dark features within the Great Red Spot that appear, disappear and change shape over time. It was not clear from individual images whether these are caused by some mysterious dark-colored material within the high cloud layer, or if they are instead holes in the high clouds -- windows into a deeper, darker layer below.\n\nNow, with the ability to compare visible-light images from Hubble with thermal infrared images from Gemini captured within hours of each other, it is possible to answer the question. Regions that are dark in visible light are very bright in infrared, indicating that they are, in fact, holes in the cloud layer. In cloud-free regions, heat from Jupiter's interior that is emitted in the form of infrared light -- otherwise blocked by high-level clouds -- is free to escape into space and therefore appears bright in Gemini images.\n\n\"It's kind of like a jack-o-lantern,\" said Wong. \"You see bright infrared light coming from cloud-free areas, but where there are clouds, it's really dark in the infrared.\"\n\nHubble and Gemini as Jovian Weather Trackers\n\nThe regular imaging of Jupiter by Hubble and Gemini in support of the Juno mission is proving valuable in studies of many other weather phenomena as well, including changes in wind patterns, characteristics of atmospheric waves and the circulation of various gases in the atmosphere.\n\nHubble and Gemini can monitor the planet as a whole, providing real-time base maps in multiple wavelengths for reference for Juno's measurements in the same way that Earth-observing weather satellites provide context for NOAA's high-flying Hurricane Hunters.\n\n\"Because we now routinely have these high-resolution views from a couple of different observatories and wavelengths, we are learning so much more about Jupiter's weather,\" explained Simon. \"This is our equivalent of a weather satellite. We can finally start looking at weather cycles.\"\n\nBecause the Hubble and Gemini observations are so important for interpreting Juno data, Wong and his colleagues Simon and de Pater are making all of the processed data easily accessible to other researchers through the Mikulski Archives for Space Telescopes (MAST) at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n\"What's important is that we've managed to collect this huge data set that supports the Juno mission. There are so many applications of the data set that we may not even anticipate. So, we're going to enable other people to do science without that barrier of having to figure out on their own how to process the data,\" Wong said.\n\nThe results were published in April 2020 in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA (the European Space Agency).

There are situations, however, where thermalization is slowed down or virtually suppressed; examples are found when considering the dynamics of electron and nuclear spins in solids, where certain sub-groups behave as if isolated from the rest. Understanding why this happens and how it can be controlled is presently at the center of a broad effort, particularly for applications in the emerging field of quantum information technologies.\n\nReporting in the latest issue of Science Advances, a group of researchers based at The City College of New York (CCNY) provide new insights on the dynamics of spin thermalization at the nanoscale. The paper is entitled: \"Optically pumped spin polarization as a probe of many-body thermalization,\" and the work was carried out under the supervision of Carlos A. Meriles, the Martin and Michele Cohen Professor of Physics in CCNY's Division of Science.\n\nOne of the main hurdles to investigating nanoscale thermalization is the huge disparity between the numbers of thermal and athermal spins, the latter being only a tiny fraction of the total. To show the flow of spin polarization between these groups, experiments must be simultaneously sensitive to both groups, a difficult proposition as most techniques are adapted to one group or the other but ill-suited for both. Working with physicists at the University of California, Berkeley, and Argentina's Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Meriles' CCNY group developed a technique that circumvents this problem. Further, using this technique it was possible to see that under certain specific conditions, it is possible to make those isolated ('athermal') spins 'communicate' with the rest.\n\n\"In a solid, electron spins typically take the form of impurities or imperfections in the crystal lattice, whereas nuclear spins are associated to the atoms of the crystal itself and thus are way more abundant,\" said Meriles. \"For example, for diamond, the system we studied, electron spins are the 'NV' and 'P1' centers, and nuclear spins are the carbons in the diamond lattice.\"\n\nBecause the electron spin is much stronger than the nuclear spin, carbons close to NVs or P1s experience a local magnetic field, absent for carbons that are farther away. Because of the local field they experience, hyperfine-coupled carbons have been traditionally assumed to be isolated from the rest, in the sense that, if polarized, they cannot pass this polarization to the bulk, i.e., their spin is frozen or 'localized', hence leading to an 'athermal' behavior.\n\n\"Our experiments demonstrate that the ideas above are not valid when the concentration of electron spins is sufficiently high. In this limit, we find that hyperfine coupled and bulk nuclei communicate efficiently because groups of electron spins serve as effective linkers to move around otherwise isolated nuclear spin polarization. We find this process can be really effective, leading to fast nuclear spin transport rates, exceeding even those between bulk nuclei,\" said Meriles.\n\nOverall, the CCNY team's findings could help realize devices that use electron and nuclear spins in solids for quantum information processing or sensing at the nanoscale. Indirectly, it could also help implement states of high nuclear spin polarization that could be applied in MRI and NMR spectroscopy.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507143039.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T18:30:39", "title": "Laser loop couples quantum systems over a distance", "text": "For the first time, researchers have succeeded in creating strong coupling between quantum systems over a greater distance. They accomplished this with a novel method in which a laser loop connects the systems, enabling nearly lossless exchange of information and strong interaction between them. The physicists reported that the new method opens up new possibilities in quantum networks and quantum sensor technology.\n\nQuantum technology is currently one of the most active fields of research worldwide. It takes advantage of the special properties of quantum mechanical states of atoms, light, or nanostructures to develop, for example, novel sensors for medicine and navigation, networks for information processing and powerful simulators for materials sciences. Generating these quantum states normally requires a strong interaction between the systems involved, such as between several atoms or nanostructures.\n\nUntil now, however, sufficiently strong interactions were limited to short distances. Typically, two systems had to be placed close to each other on the same chip at low temperatures or in the same vacuum chamber, where they interact via electrostatic or magnetostatic forces. Coupling them across larger distances, however, is required for many applications such as quantum networks or certain types of sensors.\n\nA team of physicists, led by Professor Philipp Treutlein from the Department of Physics at the University of Basel and the Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI), has now succeeded for the first time in creating strong coupling between two systems over a greater distance across a room temperature environment. In their experiment, the researchers used laser light to couple the vibrations of a 100 nanometer thin membrane to the motion of the spin of atoms over a distance of one meter. As a result, each vibration of the membrane sets the spin of the atoms in motion and vice versa.\n\nA loop of light acts as a mechanical spring\n\nThe experiment is based on a concept that the researchers developed together with the theoretical physicist Professor Klemens Hammerer from the University of Hanover. It involves sending a beam of laser light back and forth between the systems. \"The light then behaves like a mechanical spring stretched between the atoms and the membrane, and transmits forces between the two,\" explains Dr. Thomas Karg, who carried out the experiments as part of his doctoral thesis at the University of Basel. In this laser loop, the properties of the light can be controlled such that no information about the motion of the two systems is lost to the environment, thus ensuring that the quantum mechanical interaction is not disturbed.\n\nThe researchers have now succeeded in implementing this concept experimentally for the first time and used it in a series of experiments. \"The coupling of quantum systems with light is very flexible and versatile,\" explains Treutlein. \"We can control the laser beam between the systems, which allows us to generate different types of interactions that are useful for quantum sensors, for example.\"\n\nA new tool for quantum technologies\n\nIn addition to coupling atoms with nanomechanical membranes, the new method might also be used in several other systems; for example, when coupling superconducting quantum bits or solid-state spin systems used in quantum computing research. The new technique for light-mediated coupling could be used to interconnect such systems, creating quantum networks for information processing and simulations.

As individual education level increased so did nutritional intake encouraged as part of a healthy diet, particularly iron and total folate.\n\nThe findings highlight the need for strong policies supporting good nutrition, prioritising lower education groups.\n\nPoor diet and malnutrition linked to noncommunicable diseases, such as obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, presents major health problems across Europe.

A new process to harness multiple disease models for outbreak management has been developed by an international team of researchers. The team describes the process in a paper appearing May 8 in the journal Science and was awarded a Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) from the National Science Foundation to immediately implement the process to help inform policy decisions for the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nDuring a disease outbreak, many research groups independently generate models, for example projecting how the disease will spread, which groups will be impacted most severely, or how implementing a particular management action might affect these dynamics. These models help inform public health policy for managing the outbreak.\n\n\"While most models have strong scientific underpinnings, they often differ greatly in their projections and policy recommendation,\" said Katriona Shea, professor of biology and Alumni Professor in the Biological Sciences, Penn State. \"This means that policymakers are forced to rely on consensus when it appears, or on a single trusted source of advice, without confidence that their decisions will be the best possible.\"\n\nAt the onset of an outbreak, particularly for a new disease, a large amount of information is often unavailable or unknown, and researchers must make decisions about how to incorporate this uncertainty into their models, leading to differing projections. For the COVID-19 outbreak, for example, uncertainty is present in a wide range of areas, from infection rate to details of transmission to the capacity of health care systems. The designers of each model bring their own perspective and approach to address these uncertainties.\n\n\"In order to improve modeling and analysis of epidemic disease, it is essential to develop protocols that deliberately generate and evaluate valuable individual ideas from across the modeling community,\" said Michael Runge, a research ecologist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center who specializes in decision analysis for wildlife management. \"We have identified best practices that allow the synthesis and evaluation of input from multiple modeling groups in an efficient and timely manner.\"\n\nIn the three-part process, multiple research groups first create models for specified management scenarios, for example, addressing how caseload would be affected if social isolation measures were lifted this summer, or how the duration of the outbreak would change if students return to school in the fall. The research groups work independently during this step to encourage a wide range of ideas without prematurely conforming to a certain way of thinking. Then, the modeling groups formally discuss their models with each other -- an important addition to previous multiple model methods -- which allows them to examine why their models might disagree. Finally, the groups work independently again to refine their models, based on the insights from the discussion and comparison stage.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAfter group discussion and individual model refinement, the models are combined into an overall projection for each management strategy, which can be used to help guide risk analysis and policy deliberation. At this stage, methods from the field of decision analysis can allow the decision maker, for example a public health agency, to understand the merits of different management options in the face of the existing uncertainty.\n\nAdditionally, the combined results can help identify which uncertainty -- what pieces of missing information -- are most critical to learn about in order to improve models and thus improve decision making, providing a way to prioritize research directions.\n\n\"This process allows us to embrace uncertainty, rather than hastening to a premature consensus that could derail or deflect management efforts,\" said Shea. \"The process encourages a healthy conversation between scientists and decision makers, enabling policy agencies to more effectively achieve their management goals.\"\n\nEven after initial decisions are made, the process can continue as new information about the outbreak and management becomes available. This \"adaptive management\" strategy can allow researchers to refine their models and make new predictions as the outbreak progresses. For COVID-19, this process might inform how and when isolation and travel bans are lifted, and if these or other measures might be necessary again in the future.\n\nThe research team plans to implement this process immediately for COVID-19. By taking advantage of the many research groups already producing models for the current outbreak, the strategy should be easy to implement while producing more robust results from the existing process. The team will share results with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as they are generated.\n\n\"We hope this process actively feeds into policy for the COVID-19 response in the United States,\" said Shea. \"It also provides a framework for future outbreak settings, including emerging diseases and agricultural pest species, and management of endemic infectious diseases, including vaccination strategies and disease surveillance.\"\n\nIn addition to Shea and Runge, the research team includes David Pannell at the University of Western Australia, William Probert at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, Shou-Li Li at Lanzhou University in China, Michael Tildesley at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, and Matthew Ferrari at Penn State.\n\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Penn State Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences though the Coronavirus Research Seed Fund.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507143008.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T18:30:08", "title": "Planting trees is no panacea for climate change: Campaigns to plant 1 trillion trees must be undertaken with care and a commitment to long-term management", "text": "Restoration ecologist Karen Holl has a simple message for anyone who thinks planting 1 trillion trees will reverse the damage of climate change.\n\n\"We can't plant our way out of climate change,\" says Holl, professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz and a leading expert in forest restoration. \"It is only one piece of the puzzle.\"\n\nIn a commentary that appears in the May 8 issue of Science, Holl and coauthor Pedro Brancalion, a professor in the Department of Forest Sciences at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, endorse the benefits of trees but caution against a simplistic view of tree-planting as a panacea for environmental degradation.\n\n\"Trees are deeply entrenched in the human psyche,\" said Holl, a restoration ecologist who has prepared hundreds of students for careers in environmental stewardship. \"It's very satisfying to go out and put a tree in the ground. It's a concrete, tangible thing to do.\"\n\nBut broad-scale tree planting initiatives, such as 1t.org and the Trillion Tree Campaign, must be undertaken carefully and with a commitment to long-term management, if the benefits are to be fully realized.\n\n\"Planting trees is not a simple solution,\" said Holl. \"It's complicated, and we need to be realistic about what we can and cannot achieve. We need to be thoughtful and plan for the long term.\"\n\nOn the plus side, planting trees can improve biodiversity, water quality, and increase shade. But depending on where and how it is done, tree planting can also harm native ecosystems and species, reduce water supply, and dispossess local landholders and increase social inequity.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn their commentary, Holl and Brancalion present four principles that should guide forest enhancement initiatives:\n\nReduce forest clearing and degradation: Protecting and maintaining intact forests is more efficient, more ecologically sound, and less costly than planting trees, or replanting.\n\nView tree planting as one part of multifaceted environmental solutions: Enhanced tree cover is one of the best options to offset a portion of the greenhouse gas emissions driven by human activities, but they represent only a small portion of the carbon reductions that are needed -- and estimates vary by more than tenfold depending on variables used in modeling.\n\nBalance ecological and social goals: Acknowledge competing land uses and focus on landscapes with the potential to generate large-scale benefits, such as the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, where regional planning of tree planting initiatives can lead to three times the conservation gains at half the cost.\n\nPlan, coordinate, and monitor: Work with local stakeholders to resolve conflicting land-use goals and ensure maximum effectiveness over the long term. Planting trees doesn't ensure they will survive; a review of mangrove forest restoration efforts in Sri Lanka following the 2004 tsunami showed fewer than 10 percent of trees survived in 75 percent of sites.\n\nTo be successful, tree-planting initiatives need to engage local stakeholders and confront conflicting goals for land use. \"Much of the land proposed for tree planting is already being used to grow crops, harvest timber, and other subsistence activities, so tree planting initiatives need to consider how landowners will earn income,\" said Holl. \"Otherwise, activities such as agriculture or logging will just move to other lands\"\n\nHoll chooses her words carefully when she says she applauds the widespread enthusiasm for \"increasing forest cover,\" which is not the same thing as planting more trees.\n\n\"The first thing we can do is keep existing forests standing, and the second is to allow trees to regenerate in areas that were formerly forests,\" said Holl, who specializes in tropical forest restoration. \"In many cases, trees will recover on their own -- just look at the entire eastern United States that was deforested 200 years ago. Much of that has come back without actively planting trees. Yes, in some highly degraded lands we will need to plant trees, but that should be the last option since it is the most expensive and often is not successful. I've spent my life on this. We need to be thoughtful about how we bring the forest back.\"\n\nCritically, slowing the pace of climate change requires a comprehensive strategy that starts with burning less fossil fuel, said Holl.\n\n\"Trees are a small piece of what needs to be a broader strategy,\" said Holl. \"We're better off not releasing greenhouse gases to begin with.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507135355.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T17:53:55", "title": "Immunity of recovered COVID-19 patients could cut risk of expanding economic activity", "text": "While attention remains focused on the number of COVID-19 deaths and new cases, a separate statistic -- the number of recovered patients -- may be equally important to the goal of minimizing the pandemic's infection rate as shelter-in-place orders are lifted.\n\nThe presumed immunity of those who have recovered from the infection could allow them to safely substitute for susceptible people in certain high-contact occupations such as healthcare. Dubbed \"shield immunity,\" the anticipated protection against short-term reinfection could allow recovered patients to expand their interactions with infected and susceptible people, potentially reducing overall transmission rates when interactions are permitted to expand.\n\nNew modeling of the virus' behavior suggests that an intervention strategy based on shield immunity could reduce the risk of allowing the higher levels of human interaction needed to support expanded economic activity. The number of Americans infected by the novel coronavirus is likely much higher than what has been officially reported, and that could be good news for efforts to utilize their presumed immunity to protect the larger community.\n\nHowever, there are two important caveats to the strategy. The first is that the duration of immunity to reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown; however, individuals who survived infections by related viral infections, like SARS, had persistent antibodies for approximately two years -- and those who survived infection to MERS had evidence of immunity for approximately three years. The second issue is that determining on a broad scale who has antibodies that may protect them from the coronavirus will require a level of reliable serological testing not yet available in the United States.\n\n\"Our model describes ways in which serological tests used to identify individuals who have been infected by and recovered from COVID-19 could help both reduce future transmission and foster increased economic engagement,\" said Joshua Weitz, professor in the School of Biological Sciences and founding director of the Interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Quantitative Biosciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \"The idea is to think in advance about how identifying recovered individuals could help serve the collective good, using information collected on neutralizing antibodies in new ways.\"\n\nA paper describing the modeling behind the concept of shield immunity was published May 7 in the journal Nature Medicine by a team of researchers from Georgia Tech, Princeton University and McMaster University. The researchers studied the potential impacts of presumed immunity among recovered persons using a computational model of COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics, building upon a SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) framework.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a population of 10 million citizens, for example, the model predicts that in a worst-case transmission scenario, implementation of an intermediate shielding strategy could help reduce deaths from 71,000 to 58,000, while an enhanced shielding plan could cut deaths from 71,000 to 20,000. The model also suggests that shielding could enhance the effects of social distancing strategies that may remain in place once higher levels of economic activity resume.\n\nIdentification of individuals who have protective antibodies against the novel coronavirus has begun only recently. Antibody tests are not 100% specific, implying that tests can lead to false positives. However, targeted use of antibody testing in groups with elevated exposure will lead to increases in positive predictive value, even with imperfect tests. The serological antibody test differs from widespread polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing being done to determine whether people are actively infected with the virus.\n\nAmong healthcare professionals, serological testing could identify recovered individuals who might then be able to interact with patients with reduced concern for infection. Other recovered individuals could be used to help reduce transmission risk in nursing homes, the food service industry, emergency medical services, grocery stores, retailing and other essential operations. Across society, the relatively small number of individuals with immunity could substitute for people whose immunity status isn't known; reducing transmission risk both for recovered individuals and those who remain immunologically naive.\n\n\"We want to think about serology as an intervention,\" Weitz said. \"Finding out who is immune to the coronavirus could make a big difference in trying to reduce the risk to people who would be vulnerable by interacting with someone who could pass on the disease.\"\n\nSerological testing to identify those with immunity might begin with healthcare workers, who may be more likely to have been infected by the coronavirus because of their exposure to infected persons, Weitz said. Because so many infections do not produce the distinctive COVID-19 symptoms, it's likely that many people have recovered from the illness without knowing they've had had it, potentially expanding the pool of recovered persons.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"There may be a deeper pool of individuals who can help within their own fields and other fields of specialization to reduce transmission,\" Weitz said. \"The reality is that people within high-contact jobs probably are likely to have a higher incidence of infection than other groups.\"\n\nBut using antibody information about individuals would create potential privacy issues, and require that those individuals make informed decisions about accepting additional risks for the greater good of the community.\n\n\"What this model says is that if we could identify individuals who are immune, there is a chance that some individuals would not have to reduce their level of interaction with others because that interaction would be less risky,\" he added. \"Rather than trying to keep reducing interactions, which is helpful for reducing transmission but bad for what it does for the economy, we might be able to maintain interactions while reducing the risk, combined with other mitigation approaches.\"\n\nUltimately, addressing the pandemic will require development and mass production of a vaccine that could boost immunity levels beyond 60 percent in the general population. Until that is available, Weitz believes that shield immunity could become part of the approach to the challenge.\n\n\"We don't have a silver bullet,\" he said. \"Until we have a vaccine, we will have to use a combination of strategies to control COVID-19, and shield immunity is potentially one of them.\"\n\nIn addition to Weitz, co-authors of the paper included Dr. Stephen J.

They divide and continually generate new nerve cells and enable the brain to constantly adapt to new demands. Various genetic mutations impede neural stem cell activity and thus lead to learning and memory deficits in the people affected. Very little has hitherto been known about the mechanisms responsible for this.\n\nEnzyme regulates brain stem cell activity\n\nAn international research team led by Sebastian Jessberger, professor at the Brain Research Institute at the University of Zurich (UZH), is now demonstrating for the first time that a lipid metabolism enzyme regulates the lifelong activity of brain stem cells, in a study published in Cell Stem Cell. This enzyme -- known as fatty acid synthase (FASN) -- is responsible for the formation of fatty acids. A specific mutation in the enzyme's genetic information causes cognitive deficits in affected patients.\n\nHeaded by postdoc Megan Bowers and PhD candidates Tong Liang and Daniel Gonzalez-Bohorquez, the researchers studied the genetic change of FASN in the mouse model as well as in human cerebral organoids -- organ-like cell cultures of the brain that are formed from human embryonic stem cells. \"This approach allows us to analyze the effects of the defective enzyme in the brains of adult mice and during early human brain development in parallel,\" explains Jessberger. The research involved altering the genetic information of both the mice and the human organoids experimentally so that the lipid metabolism enzyme exhibited the exact mutation that had been found in people with cognitive deficits.\n\nDiminished stem cell activity reduces cognitive performance\n\nThe FASN mutation led to reduced division of stem cells, which constantly generate new nerve cells, both in mice and in human tissue. The hyperactivity of the mutated enzyme is responsible for this, since fats accumulate inside the cell, putting the stem cells under stress and reducing their ability to divide. Similar to cognitive deficits found in affected people, mice also displayed learning and memory deficits due to the mutation. \"Our results provide evidence of the functional correlation between lipid metabolism, stem cell activity and cognitive performance,\" says Jessberger.\n\nThe mechanism now identified shows how lipid metabolism regulates neuronal stem cells activity and thus influences brain development. \"The new discoveries regarding learning and memory deficits in people were only made possible by linking our research on animal models and in human cells,\" stresses Jessberger. According to the research scientists, their methodology provides a \"blueprint\" for conducting detailed research into the activity of brain stem cells and their role in cognitive processes, and therefore for achieving a better understanding of poorly understood diseases.\n\nStem cells as a therapeutic objective for brain diseases\n\n\"In addition, we hope that it will be possible to control stem cell activity therapeutically to use them for brain repair -- for example for the future treatment of cognitive disorders or in association with diseases that involve the death of nerve cells, such as Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease,\" says Sebastian Jessberger.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507131332.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T17:13:32", "title": "A role reversal for the function of certain circadian network neurons", "text": "A newly published study in Current Biology reveals surprising findings about the function of circadian network neurons that undergo daily structural change. The research could lead to a better understanding of how to address circadian rhythm disruptions in humans and facilitate preventing a host of associated health problems, including increased risk for cancer and metabolic syndrome.\n\nCircadian networks are collections of neurons that serve as master body clocks in all animals, helping them know when to sleep and when to be productive. Scientists have long studied the circadian networks of the Drosophila melanogaster (better known as the fruit fly) to gain insight into how the human body clock operates. Recently, investigators at the Advanced Science Research Center at The Graduate Center, CUNY (CUNY ASRC) and Barnard College examined the function of small regions of important neuronal clocks in the fly's brain. Some segments of the neurons in these regions undergo daily remodeling, displaying a highly branched structure at the beginning of the day and a simpler structure at the beginning of the night. Scientists previously believed that these segments -- called the dorsal medial termini -- served a critical output function, sending signals that tell the fruit fly's brain what time of day it is. But the research team discovered that they actually serve in an input capacity, receiving cues from the external environment about the time of day.\n\n\"The circadian network shapes the timing of sleep and activity through two key mechanisms: an endogenous clock, which runs on a cycle that is slightly longer or shorter than the Earth's 24-hour solar day; and the process of entrainment, which adjusts the endogenous clock every day to keep it in sync with the solar day,\" said Orie Shafer, a professor with the CUNY ASRC Neuroscience Initiative and the study's co-senior investigator. \"For years, the field has assumed that the dorsal medial termini would be required for a strong endogenous clock. But when we tested this prediction in flies in which the formation of these segments was prevented, we found the flies' clocks were absolutely fine but that they had a difficult time synchronizing them to the rising and falling of environmental temperatures.\"\n\nFor their study, researchers bred fruit flies with undeveloped dorsal medial termini segments that completely lacked the structures that normally change throughout the day. The flies were then examined to see if this manipulation had effects on circadian timekeeping. Remarkably, the manipulated flies displayed completely normal circadian rhythms in sleep and activity. Given this surprising result, the researchers then asked if the loss of the dorsal medial termini segment might prevent the normal synchronization of the clock with daily changes environmental cues. The researchers observed that fruit flies lacking dorsal termini were unable to properly synchronize their sleep/activity rhythms to daily temperature cycles. Previous research has shown that temperature changes play a role in regulating circadian rhythms. These new findings strongly suggest that dorsal medial termini neurons likely input (receive) signals from regions of the brain that track environmental temperature.\n\n\"I have been curious for some time to know whether the structural plasticity that I characterized in clock neurons as a part of my graduate student work was an output mechanism for the clock to connect with downstream targets,\" said the study's first and co-senior author Maria Fern\u00e1ndez, an assistant professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Behavior at Barnard College. \"We were surprised to see that this site of plasticity seems to be involved in input, rather than output, pathways.\"\n\nThe neurons examined in the fruit fly serve timekeeping functions that are highly similar to neurons in mammals, so the researchers' results suggest that daily changes in neuronal segment structures may shape the sensitivity of circadian network neurons to cues from the environments in all animals, including humans. This finding is important for understanding how the body's internal clock is reset every day. This process, called \"entrainment,\" appears to be challenged by modern lighting and social environments, contributing to a growing list of health issues including cancer and obesity.\n\nThis study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507131327.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T17:13:27", "title": "Virgin birth has scientists buzzing: Researchers discover a gene in honey bees that causes virgin birth", "text": "In a study published today in Current Biology, researchers from University of Sydney have identified the single gene that determines how Cape honey bees reproduce without ever having sex. One gene, GB45239 on chromosome 11, is responsible for virgin births.\n\n\"It is extremely exciting,\" said Professor Benjamin Oldroyd in the School of Life and Environmental Sciences. \"Scientists have been looking for this gene for the last 30 years. Now that we know it's on chromosome 11, we have solved a mystery.\"\n\nBehavioural geneticist Professor Oldroyd said: \"Sex is a weird way to reproduce and yet it is the most common form of reproduction for animals and plants on the planet. It's a major biological mystery why there is so much sex going on and it doesn't make evolutionary sense. Asexuality is a much more efficient way to reproduce, and every now and then we see a species revert to it.\"\n\nIn the Cape honey bee, found in South Africa, the gene has allowed worker bees to lay eggs that only produce females instead of the normal males that other honey bees do. \"Males are mostly useless,\" Professor Oldroyd said. \"But Cape workers can become genetically reincarnated as a female queen and that prospect changes everything.\"\n\nBut it also causes problems. \"Instead of being a cooperative society, Cape honey bee colonies are riven with conflict because any worker can be genetically reincarnated as the next queen. When a colony loses its queen the workers fight and compete to be the mother of the next queen,\" Professor Oldroyd said.\n\nThe ability to produce daughters asexually, known as \"thelytokous parthenogenesis,\" is restricted to a single subspecies inhabiting the Cape region of South Africa, the Cape honey bee or Apis mellifera capensis.\n\nSeveral other traits distinguish the Cape honey bee from other honey bee subspecies. In particular, the ovaries of worker bees are larger and more readily activated and they are able to produce queen pheromones, allowing them to assert reproductive dominance in a colony.\n\nThese traits also lead to a propensity for social parasitism, a behaviour where Cape bee workers invade foreign colonies, reproduce and persuade the host colony workers to feed their larvae. Every year in South Africa, 10,000 colonies of commercial beehives die because of the social parasite behaviour in Cape honey bees.\n\n\"This is a bee we must keep out of Australia,\" Professor Oldroyd said.\n\nThe existence of Cape bees with these characters has been known for over a hundred years, but it is only recently, using modern genomic tools, that we have been able to understand the actual gene that gives rise to virgin birth.\n\n\"Further study of Cape bees could give us insight into two major evolutionary transitions: the origin of sex and the origin of animal societies,\" Professor Oldroyd said.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting prospect arising from this study is the possibility to understand how the gene actually works functionally. \"If we could control a switch that allows animals to reproduce asexually, that would have important applications in agriculture, biotechnology and many other fields,\" Professor Oldroyd said. For instance, many pest ant species like fire ants are thelytokous, though unfortunately it seems to be a different gene to the one found in Capensis.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507131317.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T17:13:17", "title": "Quantum jump tipping the balance: Measuring tiny differences in mass between different quantum states provides new insights into heavy atoms", "text": "A new door to the quantum world has been opened: when an atom absorbs or releases energy via the quantum leap of an electron, it becomes heavier or lighter. This can be explained by Einstein's theory of relativity (E = mc2). However, the effect is minuscule for a single atom. Nevertheless, the team of Klaus Blaumand Sergey Eliseev at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics has successfully measured this infinitesimal change in the mass of individual atoms for the first time. In order to achieve this, they used the ultra-precise Pentatrap atomic balance at the Institute in Heidelberg. The team discovered a previously unobserved quantum state in rhenium, which could be interesting for future atomic clocks. Above all, this extremely sensitive atomic balance enables a better understanding of the complex quantum world of heavy atoms.\n\nAstonishing, but true: if you wind a mechanical watch, it becomes heavier. The same thing happens when you charge your smartphone. This can be explained by the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m), which Einstein expressed in the most famous formula in physics: E = mc2 (c: speed of light in vacuum). However, this effect is so small that it completely eludes our everyday experience. A conventional balance would not be able to detect it.\n\nBut at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, there is a balance that can: Pentatrap. It can measure the minuscule change in mass of a single atom when an electron in it absorbs or releases energy via a quantum jump, thus opening a new world for precision physics. Such quantum jumps in the electron shells of atoms shape our world -- whether in life-giving photosynthesis and general chemical reactions or in the creation of colour and our vision.\n\nAn ant on top of an elephant\n\nRima Sch\u00fcssler, now a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, has helped build Pentatrap since completing her Master's thesis in 2014. She is the lead author of a paper on an unexpected discovery made in a collaboration at the Max Planck PTB Riken Centre: In rhenium, there is a previously undiscovered electronic quantum state with special properties. Sch\u00fcssler uses the following analogy to describe the degree of sensitivity with which Pentatrap can detect the jump of an electron into this quantum state via the mass change of a rhenium atom: \"By weighing a six-tonne elephant, we were able to determine whether a ten-milligram ant was crawling on it.\"\n\nPentatrap consists of five Penning traps. In order for such a trap to be able to weigh an atom, it must be electrically charged (i.e. become an ion). Because rhenium was stripped of 29 of its 75 electrons, it is highly charged. This dramatically increases the accuracy of the measurement. The trap captures this highly charged rhenium ion in a combination of a magnetic field and a specially shaped electric field. Inside, it travels in a circular path, which is intricately twisted into itself. In principle, it can be thought of as a ball on a rope, which is allowed to rotate in the air. If this is done with constant force, a heavier ball rotates slower than a lighter one.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAn extremely long-lived quantum state in rhenium\n\nIn Pentatrap, two rhenium ions rotated alternately in the stacked traps. One ion was in the energetically lowest quantum state. When the second ion was generated, an electron was randomly excited into a higher state by supplying energy. In a sense, it was the wound watch. Because of the stored energy, it became marginally heavier and thus circulated slower than the first ion. Pentatrap precisely counts the number of revolutions per time unit. The difference in the number of revolutions yielded the increase in weight.\n\nUsing this method, the team discovered an extremely long-lived quantum state in rhenium. It is metastable (i.e. it decays after a certain lifetime). According to the calculations of theoreticians from the institute led by Zolt\u00e1n Harman and Christoph H. Keitel, the University of Heidelberg, and the Kastler Brossel Laboratory in Paris, this is 130 days. The energy of the quantum state also agrees quite well with model calculations using state-of-the-art quantum mechanical methods.\n\nPossible application in future atomic clocks\n\nSuch excited electronic states in highly charged ions are interesting for basic research as well as for possible application in future atomic clocks as researched by the working group of Jos\u00e9 Crespo L\u00f3pez-Urrutia at the Institute in cooperation with the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). For them, the metastable state in rhenium is attractive for several reasons. First, because of its longevity, it corresponds to a sharp orbital frequency of the electron around the atomic nucleus. Second, the electron can be excited with soft X-ray light to jump into this quantum state. In principle, such a clock could tick faster and therefore even more accurately than the current generation of optical atomic clocks. However, according to Ekkehard Peik, who is in charge of the \"Time and Frequency\" Department at PTB and who was not involved in the work, it is still too early to speculate whether the discovery could be suitable for a new generation of atomic clocks.\n\n\"Nevertheless, this new method for discovering long-lived quantum states is spectacular,\" stresses the physicist. He imagines that atomic clocks working with such new quantum states could initially offer a new test field for basic research. Because the rhenium ions lack many mutually shielding electrons, the remaining electrons feel the electric field of the atomic nucleus particularly strongly. The electrons therefore race around the nucleus at such high speeds that their motion must be described using Einstein's theory of special relativity. With the new atomic balance, it would also be possible to test with high precision whether special relativity and quantum theory interact as described by this theory.\n\nIn general, the new atomic balance offers a novel access to the quantum-like inner life of heavier atoms. Because these consist of many particles -- electrons, protons, and neutrons -- they cannot be calculated exactly. The atomic models for theoretical calculations are therefore based on simplifications, and these can now be checked extremely accurately. It might be possible to use such atoms as probes in the search for unknown particles, which can be detected only by the extremely weak gravitational force.

Professor Dmitry Budker and his team usually use atomic magnetometry to explore fundamental questions of physics, such as the search for new particles. Magnetometry is the term used to describe the measurement of magnetic fields. One simple example of its application is the compass, which the Earth's magnetic field causes to point north.\n\nNon-contact quality assurance of batteries using atomic magnetometers\n\nThe demand for high-capacity rechargeable batteries is growing and so is the need for a form of sensitive, accurate diagnostic technology for determining the state of a battery cell. The success of many new developments will depend on whether batteries can be produced that can deliver sufficient capacity and a long effective life span. \"Undertaking the quality assurance of rechargeable batteries is a significant challenge. Non-contact methods can potentially provide fresh stimulus for improvement in batteries,\" said Dr. Arne Wickenbrock, a member of Professor Dmitry Budker's work group at the JGU Institute of Physics and the Helmholtz Institute Mainz. The group has achieved a breakthrough by using atomic magnetometers to take measurements. The idea came about during a teleconference between Budker and his colleague Professor Alexej Jerschow of New York University. They developed a concept and, with close cooperation between the two groups, carried out the related experiments in Mainz.\n\n\"Our technique works in essentially the same way as magnetic resonance imaging, but it is much simpler because we use atomic magnetometers,\" said Wickenbrock, who is part of the team conducting the investigations. Atomic magnetometers are optically pumped magnetometers that use atoms in gaseous form as probes for a magnetic field. They are commercially available and are used in industrial applications as well as fundamental research. Budker's group at JGU and HIM, which also develops advanced magnetic sensors of their own, uses these atomic magnetometers for fundamental research in physics, such as in the search for dark matter and in attempts to solve the riddle as to why matter and antimatter did not immediately annihilate each other after the Big Bang.\n\nSimple method enables fast, high-throughput measurements\n\nIn the case of battery measurements, the batteries are placed in a background magnetic field. The batteries alter this background magnetic field and the change is measured using atomic magnetometers. \"The change gives us information about the state of charge of the battery, about how much charge is left in the battery, and about possible damage,\" added Wickenbrock. \"The process is fast and, in our opinion, can be easily integrated into production processes.\" Recurring reports of serious injuries resulting from the explosion of e-cigarettes and the restrictions on taking certain types of cell phones on airplanes show that there is a need for detecting defects in battery cells.\n\n\"The diagnostic power of this technique is promising for the assessment of cells in research, for quality control, or during operation,\" the authors stated in their recent PNAS paper. Last summer, the same work group organized two events on applied atomic and nuclear physics with high-level international participation. About 200 researchers from all over the world addressed current questions of atomic magnetometry and other forms of quantum measurement techniques.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507131313.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T17:13:13", "title": "A radar for plastic: High-resolution map of 1 kilometer grids to track plastic emissions in seas: Scientists in Japan develop a new method to track plastic emissions from land to sea", "text": "Plastic may be an indispensable part of our daily lives, but its robustness and abundance have led to its overuse, putting a huge burden on the environment. Large emissions of plastic waste result in its accumulation in water bodies: in fact, recent studies have estimated about 0.27 million tons of plastic floating in the world's oceans. Because plastic does not decompose in water, it is a serious hazard for the marine life. Thus, to prevent plastic pollution, it is crucial to understand exactly how plastic is emitted into the oceans. Previous studies have tried to analyze plastic emissions, but they had some limitations: they focused on mostly mismanaged plastic waste and not how these plastic emissions actually originate.\n\nTo this end, a group of scientists at the Tokyo University of Science, led by Prof Yasuo Nihei, developed a new method to combat plastic emissions. In a study published in Water, they generated a \"high-resolution map of 1 km grids of plastic emissions across Japan. Prof Nihei explains, \"If plastic waste continues to flow into the sea, the amount of plastic waste will increase. To prevent this, it is necessary to clearly indicate where and how plastic debris is currently being generated.\"\n\nTo begin with, the scientists focused on the different types of plastics: microplastic (MicP), which is less than 5 mm in size, and macroplastic (MacP), which is greater than 5 mm. They understood that controlling MicP was crucial because -- owing to its small size -- it is particularly hard to recover once it enters the ocean. Moreover, it can easily be ingested by marine organisms, which can negatively affect ecosystems worldwide. To avoid the emission of MicP in water bodies, it was important to find out exactly where these emissions were coming from.\n\nThe scientists followed a three-step process to map plastic emissions. First, they measured MicP concentration across 70 rivers and 90 sites in Japan and examined the relation between MicP concentration and land characteristics. They collected the ratio of MacP/MicP concentrations to evaluate the MacP concentration from the MicP concentration. Next, to obtain outflow discharge at 1 km grids, they performed a \"water balance analysis\" in which they measured precipitation of water, distributed into three categories: evaporation, surface runoff, and underground infiltration. Finally, they calculate total plastic emission, which is the product of MicP and MacP concentrations and outflow discharge. Their findings revealed that MicP concentrations and basin characteristics were significantly correlated, meaning that the physical features of water bodies dictate the amount of plastic waste accumulated. Not just this, their analysis helped the scientists to estimate the annual plastic emission in Japan, which ranged from 210 to 4,776 tons/year of total plastic.\n\nThe scientists then evaluated a high-resolution map of plastic emission over 1 km grids across Japan. They identified the critical areas where plastic emissions were the highest. Their analysis showed that these emissions were high in rivers near urbanized areas, with a high population density. Among these, cities like Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka were found to be hotspots for plastic emissions. Thus, this method was useful in understanding exactly where strict countermeasures should be enforced.\n\nUnlike previous studies, this study does not assume that the plastic waste is only proportional to mismanaged plastic waste but, in fact, takes into account the origin of plastic emissions. This makes it easier to implement measures and curb plastic emissions in specific areas. Prof Nihei concludes, \"Our findings provide new insights that may be used to draft countermeasures against plastic emissions, thereby reducing outflow of marine pollutants from Japan. We also introduce a new method that can be used to evaluate plastic inputs in other regions of the world.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507131311.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T17:13:11", "title": "The feeling a limb doesn't belong is linked to lack of brain structure and connection", "text": "People with the mental health condition known as body integrity dysphoria (BID) often feel as though one of their healthy limbs isn't meant to be a part of their bodies. They may act as though the limb is missing or even seek its amputation \"to feel complete.\" Now, researchers reporting in the journal Current Biology on May 7 have found that these feelings that a limb doesn't belong are mirrored in the brains of people with this condition.\n\n\"The feeling that a limb belongs to us relies on the extent to which the sensorimotor limb area is functionally connected to all the other brain regions,\" says first author Gianluca Saetta, a doctoral student at the University of Zurich. \"Crucially involved in this feeling are also the functional connectivity and the density of gray matter in the most crucial area for the representation of how our bodies should look -- the right parietal region of the brain.\"\n\n\"Interestingly, we found that the less gray matter in the right parietal region of the brain, the stronger the desire for amputation, and the more BID individuals acted as if they were amputees,\" Saetta adds. \"This simulation behavior helps them to cope with the distressing mismatch between how they want their body to look and how they see it.\"\n\nTo explore the brain mechanisms associated with BID in the new study, Saetta and senior author Peter Brugger of the Psychiatric University Clinic (PUK), Zurich, enrolled 16 men who wanted to remove their healthy left legs and sixteen healthy controls. The question was whether the men with BID would show changes in the brain's functional connectivity or structure -- and the researchers found that they did.\n\nTheir studies revealed alterations in two key regions associated with BID. The right paracentral lobule (rPCL), which houses the primary somatosensory representation of the affected left leg, showed reduced intrinsic functional connectivity to other parts of the brain, they report. The right superior parietal (rSPL) also showed reduced intrinsic functional connectivity and a reduced concentration of gray matter. That's especially notable because this brain region has been previously identified as a critical hub for body image.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers report, there were no structural alterations evident in the rPCL. In other words, there was no evidence that the men lack the ability to feel or move their left legs.\n\n\"We show clear associations between a mental state and changes in brain structure and functionality,\" Brugger said. \"Whether the neural signature of BID comes first and hampers the development of normal limb ownership or whether decades of concern about the lack of such ownership modulate cerebral circuits mediating bodily awareness cannot be answered.\"\n\nIn other words, it's hard to say whether BID leads to a lack of functional connectivity in the brain or vice versa. Nevertheless, the new findings suggest that the desire for amputation in BID individuals may be related to specific anomalies in brain architecture.\n\nThe findings show that there's more to BID than has sometimes been suggested. The researchers note that BID is expected to be included in the forthcoming 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as a \"disorder of bodily distress or bodily experience.\" While the condition is considered rare, it's unclear how many people may be affected. After all, Brugger says, it's likely many people with BID don't share this with anyone.\n\nBased on the new findings, the researchers suggest that brain stimulation techniques might hold promise in helping people with BID, a possibility that now warrants further study. Brugger also notes that there are many other variants of BID still to explore and understand better, including people who feel they should be paraplegic or blind.\n\nThis work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507131309.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T17:13:09", "title": "See a 3D mouse brain with single-cell resolution", "text": "A manually constructed 3D atlas offers a cellular-level view of the entire mouse brain.

Knowledge of mouse brain neuroanatomy has advanced dramatically over the past decade, with the advent of whole-brain mapping projects adding new data types and revealing cellular architecture in rich new detail.\n\n\"Modern digital reference atlases must evolve to stay current,\" Harris says. \"Yet classic standard atlases do not meet the demands of these cellular-resolution datasets in 3D. So, we produced a truly 3D atlas to serve as a standard anatomical framework for the whole-brain datasets being produced.\"\n\nAligning different types of datasets into CCFv3 allowed the researchers to label more than 800 brain structures. By doing so, the researchers identified several brain structures not previously described in standard mouse brain atlases, and several new nerve fiber tracts not described in other atlases.\n\n\"Given that each dataset reveals a unique labeling pattern for certain mouse brain regions, combining all these data types should complement or confirm each other, demonstrating a tremendous methodological advantage for accurately defining brain structures,\" Ng says.\n\nThe authors say that CCFv3 has higher spatial resolution than any currently existing 3D mouse brain reference space based on magnetic resonance imaging. Because CCFv3 is an average from a large population of mice, it can be used to study inter-individual variability in the volumes of 3D brain structures in the context of different disease states. In addition, many anatomical details were apparent in the average brain that were not readily discernable in any single mouse brain.\n\n\"We are now using this atlas as the common anatomical reference space for many large-scale projects, including whole-brain circuit mapping, single-cell reconstructions, and the generation of a comprehensive brain cell-type census,\" Harris says. \"All these data, and what we learn about brain architecture in turn, will at some point necessitate an updated, next-generation 3D atlas, although it is likely to be constructed with different, more automated, data-driven methods.\"\n\nThis work was funded by the Allen Institute for Brain Science and in part by National Institutes of Health.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507131305.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T17:13:05", "title": "Ancient Andes, analyzed: International team sketches first large-scale genomic portrait of pre-Columbian Andean civilizations", "text": "An international research team has conducted the first in-depth, wide-scale study of the genomic history of ancient civilizations in the central Andes mountains and coast before European contact.\n\nThe findings, published online May 7 in Cell, reveal early genetic distinctions between groups in nearby regions, population mixing within and beyond the Andes, surprising genetic continuity amid cultural upheaval, and ancestral cosmopolitanism among some of the region's most well-known ancient civilizations.\n\nLed by researchers at Harvard Medical School and the University of California, Santa Cruz, the team analyzed genome-wide data from 89 individuals who lived between 500 and 9,000 years ago. Of these, 64 genomes, ranging from 500 to 4,500 years old, were newly sequenced -- more than doubling the number of ancient individuals with genome-wide data from South America.\n\nThe analysis included representatives of iconic civilizations in the Andes from whom no genome-wide data had been reported before, including the Moche, Nasca, Wari, Tiwanaku and Inca.\n\n\"This was a fascinating and unique project,\" said Nathan Nakatsuka, first author of the paper and an MD/PhD student in the lab of David Reich in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS.\n\n\"It represents the first detailed study of Andean population history informed by pre-Colonial genomes with wide-ranging temporal and geographic coverage,\" said Lars Fehren-Schmitz, associate professor at UC Santa Cruz and co-senior author of the paper with Reich.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"This study also takes a major step toward redressing the global imbalance in ancient DNA data,\" said Reich, professor of genetics at HMS and associate member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.\n\n\"The great majority of published ancient DNA studies to date have focused on western Eurasia,\" he said. \"This study in South America allows us to begin to discern at high resolution the detailed history of human movements in this extraordinarily important part of the world.\"\n\nAttention on the Andes\n\nThe central Andes, surrounding present-day Peru, is one of the few places in the world where farming was invented rather than being adopted from elsewhere and where the earliest presence of complex civilizations in South America has been documented so far. While the region has been a major focus of archaeological research, there had been no systematic characterization with genome-wide ancient DNA until now, the authors said.\n\nGeneticists, including several of the current team members, previously studied the deep genetic history of South America as a whole, including analysis of several individuals from the Andean highlands from many thousands of years ago. There have also been analyses of present-day residents of the Andes and a limited number of mitochondrial or Y-chromosome DNA analyses from individual ancient Andean sites.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe new study, however, expands on these findings to provide a far more comprehensive portrait. Now, Nakatsuka said, researchers are \"finally able to see how the genetic structure of the Andes evolved over time.\"\n\nBy focusing on what is often called pre-Columbian history, the study demonstrates how large ancient DNA studies can reveal more about ancient cultures than studying present-day groups alone, said Reich.\n\n\"In the Andes, reconstruction of population history based on DNA analysis of present-day people has been challenging because there has so been much demographic change since contact with Europeans,\" Reich explained. \"With ancient DNA data, we can carry out a detailed reconstruction of movements of people and how those relate to changes known from the archaeological record.\"\n\n'Extraordinary' ancient population structure\n\nThe analyses revealed that by 9,000 years ago, groups living in the Andean highlands became genetically distinct from those that eventually came to live along the Pacific coast. The effects of this early differentiation are still seen today.\n\nThe genetic fingerprints distinguishing people living in the highlands from those in nearby regions are \"remarkably ancient,\" said Nakatsuka, who will receive his PhD in systems, synthetic and quantitative biology in May.\n\n\"It is extraordinary, given the small geographic distance,\" added Reich.\n\nBy 5,800 years ago, the population of the north also developed distinct genetic signatures from populations that became prevalent in the south, the team found. Again, these differences can be observed today.\n\nAfter that time, gene flow occurred among all regions in the Andes, although it dramatically slowed after 2,000 years ago, the team found.\n\n\"It is exciting that we were actually able to determine relatively fine-grained population structure in the Andes, allowing us to differentiate between coastal, northern, southern and highland groups as well as individuals living in the Titicaca Basin,\" said Fehren-Schmitz.\n\n\"This is significant for the archaeology of the Andes and will now allow us to ask more specific questions with regards to local demographies and cultural networks,\" said study co-author Jose Capriles of Pennsylvania State University.\n\nGenetic intermingling\n\nThe team discovered genetic exchanges both within the Andes and between Andean and non-Andean populations.\n\nAncient people moved between south Peru and the Argentine plains and between the north Peru coast and the Amazon, largely bypassing the highlands, the researchers found.\n\nFehren-Schmitz was especially interested to uncover signs of long-range mobility in the Inca period. Specifically, he was surprised to detect ancient North Coast ancestry not only around Cusco, Peru, but also in a child sacrifice from the Argentinian southern Andes.\n\n\"This could be seen as genetic evidence for relocations of individuals under Inca rule, a practice we know of from ethnohistorical, historical and archaeological sources,\" he said.\n\nAlthough the findings of genetic intermingling throughout the Andes correlate with known archaeological connections, they will likely prompt additional archaeological research to understand the cultural contexts underlying the migrations, said Nakatsuka.\n\n\"Now we have more evidence demonstrating important migrations and some constraints on when they happened, but further work needs to be done to know why exactly these migrations occurred,\" he said.\n\nLong-term continuity\n\nThe analyses revealed that multiple regions maintained genetic continuity over the past 2,000 years despite clear cultural transformations.\n\nThe finding contrasts with many other world regions, where ancient DNA studies often document substantial genetic turnover during this period, said Reich.\n\nThe population structures that arose early on persisted through major social changes and on into modern societies, the authors said. The discoveries offer new evidence that can be incorporated alongside archaeological and other records to inform theories on the ancient history of different groups in the region.\n\n\"To our surprise, we observed strong genetic continuity during the rise and fall of many of the large-scale Andean cultures, such as the Moche, Wari and Nasca,\" said Nakatsuka. \"Our results suggest that the fall of these cultures was not due to massive migration into the region, e.g., from an invading military force, a scenario which had been documented in some other regions of the world.\"\n\nTwo exceptions to the continuity trend were the vast urban centers that the Tiwanaku and Inca cultures called home. Rather than being fairly genetically homogeneous, the capital regions of these civilizations were cosmopolitan, hosting people from many genetic backgrounds, the team found.\n\n\"It was interesting to start to see these glimpses of ancestral heterogeneity,\" said Nakatsuka. \"These regions have some similarity to what we see now in places like New York City and other major cities where people of very different ancestries are living side by side.\"\n\nCooperative authorship\n\nThe study included authors from many disciplines and many countries, including Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Chile, Germany, Peru, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n\"This is an impressive interdisciplinary but, just as importantly, international collaboration,\" said study co-author Bastien Llamas of the University of Adelaide. \"All worked very closely to draft this manuscript under the leadership of Fehren-Schmitz and Reich.\"\n\nIt was important to team up with local scientists who belong to communities that descend from the individuals analyzed in the study, Fehren-Schmitz said, and to obtain permission from and continually engage with indigenous and other local groups as well as local governments.\n\nThe analysis of DNA from ancient individuals can have significant implications for present-day communities. One concerns the physical handling of the skeletal materials, which might be sensitive to the groups involved.\n\nThe work provided opportunities to heal past wounds. In one case, a sample from Cusco, previously housed in the U.S., was repatriated to Peru. Other remains that had long ago been taken improperly from burial sites were able to be carbon-dated and reburied.\n\nIn the absence of pre-Columbian written histories, archaeology has been the main source of information available to reconstruct the complex history of the continent, said study co-author Chiara Barbieri of the University of Zurich.\n\n\"With the study of ancient DNA, we can read the demographic history of ancient groups and understand how ancient and present-day groups are related,\" she said. \"The link with the genetic study of living populations opens a direct dialogue with the past and an occasion to involve local communities.\"\n\nThe researchers sought to deeply involve communities with the help of archaeologists from each area, said Nakatsuka. Their efforts included giving public talks about the study and translating materials into Spanish.\n\n\"We were really happy to have the summary and key findings of our paper translated and included as part of the Cell paper itself, to increase accessibility of our work,\" said Nakatsuka. \"We hope future studies will do similar translations, including versions suitable for lay audiences for schools, museum exhibits and cultural organizations, which we are in the process of doing as well.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507131259.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T17:12:59", "title": "Cannibalism helps invading invertebrates survive severe conditions", "text": "In a world where movements of non-native animal species are drastically disrupting whole ecosystems and causing economic harm and environmental change, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the features that allow them to colonize new habitats.\n\nA new study, published in Communications Biology, shows that the prolific comb jelly, a marine invertebrate invader from North America that now frequently washes up on Baltic shores, is able to expand their geographical range thanks to the use of its own young as nutrient stores through long and nutrient deprived winters.\n\nAs jellies trace their lineage back to the beginning of all animal life, this work furthers the view of cannibalism as a pervasive trait amongst the animal kingdom.\n\nMysterious success\n\nWith their translucent gelatinous bodies, they may not look like much, but the expansion of the comb jelly, Mnemiopsis leidyi, from the east coasts of North and South America to Eurasian coastal waters has wreaked havoc on local environments.\n\nTheir success has remained something of a mystery especially as, instead of storing resources before wintering, they seemed to counterproductively invest in massive 'blooms' of offspring unable to survive long and nutrient deprived winters.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt had been assumed that perhaps they were able to persist due to a lack of native predators, though both this, as well as the best conservation management strategies for this exotic species, have remained hazy.\n\nA handy floating reservoir of food\n\nThat was until an international team of researchers, including authors at the University of Southern Denmark and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, performed the dedicated collection of comb jellies throughout the year at their northernmost range in the Baltic Sea off of northern Germany.\n\nLead author of the study, Jamileh Javidpour, Assistant Prof. at University of Southern Denmark states \"we combined a study of the population dynamics of this species with experimental feeding and geochemical tracers to show, for the first time, that adult jellies were actually consuming the blooms of their own offspring.\"\n\nThis rather sinister realization behind the function of these blooms makes perfect sense. As a handy floating nutrient reservoir that lasted beyond the collapse of normal prey populations, the release of offspring provided adults with an additional 2-3 weeks window of growth which, ecologically, can be the difference between life and death.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTackling their colonization\n\n\"In some ways, the whole jelly population is acting as a single organism, with the younger groups supporting the adults through times of nutrient stress,\" says Thomas Larsen, a co-author of the study at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.\n\n\"Overall, it enables jellies to persist through extreme events and low food periods, colonizing further than climate systems and other conditions would usually allow,\" he continues.\n\nThe novel data produced by the team may allow conservationists and governments to better combat the spread of these jellies which can disadvantage native species and bring local fisheries down. In their exotic ranges, the comb jellies have been particularly successful in seas impacted by rapid warming, overfishing and excessive nutrient loads.\n\nTackling these problems could potentially reduce the food sources for these gelatinous invaders and restore the ecological balance of Eurasian seas.\n\nThe study also suggests that this jelly may become a problematic species in its native ranges, with possible rapid bloom-and-bust cycles under the right conditions.\n\nWas cannibalism an early trait?\n\nThis study also speaks to wider questions of cannibalism in the animal kingdom. Cannibalism has been recorded among over 1,500 species, including humans, chimpanzees, squirrels, fish, and dragonfly larvae.\n\nAlthough sometimes cannibalism occurs during periods of extreme shortage or disaster, it can also occur under regular conditions.\n\n\"Because comb jellies trace their ancestry back to the beginning of most animal life as we know it during the Cambrian Period, 525 Million Years Ago, it remains possible that it is a basic, unifying feature across the animal kingdom,\" Jamileh Javidpour concludes.\n\nMore research is certainly required to clarify the role of cannibalism among the earliest members of the animal kingdom and the evolutionary origins of cannibalism and the reasons why it is particularly prominent in aquatic ecosystems.\n\nNevertheless, these gelatinous critters have provided a calculating window into the use of this behaviour during the invasion of new habitats.

Heiss from the Austrian Academy of Sciences (OeAW), Austria and colleagues.\n\nA beverage with prehistoric roots, beer played ritual, social, and dietary roles across ancient societies. However, it's not easy to positively identify archaeological evidence of cereal-based alcoholic beverages like beer, since most clear markers for beer's presence lack durability or reliability.\n\nTo explore potential microstructural alterations in brewed cereal grains, Heiss and colleagues simulated archaeological preservation of commercially-available malted barley via charring (malting is the first step in the beer-brewing process.). They compared these experimental grains with ancient grains from five archaeological sites dating to the 4th millennium BCE: two known beer-brewing sites in Predynastic Egypt, and three central European lakeshore settlements where cereal-based foods were found in containers, but the presence of beer was not confirmed.\n\nUsing electron microscopy, the authors found their experimental barley grains had unusually thin aleurone cell walls (specific to grains of the grass family Poaceae, the aleurone layer is a tissue forming the outermost layer of the endosperm). The archaeological grain samples across all five prehistoric sites showed the same aleurone cell wall thinning.\n\nAlthough there are other potential reasons for this type of thinned cell wall (such as fungal decay, enzymatic activity, or degradation during heating--all of which can be ruled out with careful analysis), these results suggest that this cell wall breakdown in the grain's aleurone layer can serve as a general marker for the malting process.\n\nThis new diagnostic feature for confirming the presence of beer (or other malted beverages/foodstuffs) in artifacts works even if no intact grains are present. A novel tool for identifying the possible presence of beer in archaeological sites where no further evidence of beer-making or -drinking is preserved, this method promises to broaden our knowledge of prehistoric malting and brewing.\n\nThe authors note: \"Structural changes in the germinating grain, described decades ago by plant physiologists and brewing scientists alike, have now successfully been turned into a diagnostic feature for archaeological malt, even if the grains concerned are only preserved as pulverized and burnt crusts on pottery. A \"small side effect\" is the confirmation of the production of malt-based drinks (and beer?) in central Europe as early as the 4th millennium BC.\" Dr Heiss adds, \"For over a year, we kept checking our new feature until we (and the reviewers) were happy.

The study was carried out in collaboration by the University of Helsinki, the City of Helsinki and the Finnish Meteorological Institute.\n\nIn the end, the best option was found to be a row of taller common lime trees (Tilia x vulgaris) in the middle of the street canyon and lower Swedish whitebeams (Sorbus intermedia) lining the sides.\n\n\"In that case, the air was one-fifth cleaner compared to the least favourable option, that is the one with four rows of trees of equal height,\" says Associate Professor Leena J\u00e4rvi, head of the research group.\n\nJ\u00e4rvi considers the difference surprisingly marked. Another find that can be considered a surprise is the fact that metre-high hedgerows located under the tree row closest to the edge were seen to have no practical impact on the air quality of pavements.\n\nTrees prevent pollutant ventilation\n\nGlobally air pollution kills approximately seven million people every year. Even in relatively clean country such as Finland, hundreds of people die (1560 in 2016) as the result of air pollution every year, which makes the reduction of small particle concentration important.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe City of Helsinki is currently designing new city boulevards to replace a few of the entry motorways in order to answer the densification needs of the city. These boulevards will be accommodated and accessed by several people at the same time with expected high traffic rates. As one mean to improve the local air quality, the city is interested on vegetation, which has multiple positive effects to our well-being and aesthetics.\n\nThe cleanest air in street canyons would be achieved without any trees at all, as street trees reduce wind speed and, thus, impair the airing out of traffic pollutants from the street canyon. At the same time, vegetation is needed, for example, for ensuring wellbeing, which makes a treeless option unrealistic for planning.\n\nIn the options investigated, the number of tree rows ranged between two and four, with the latter option being four metres wider and the one with two rows of trees four meters narrower than the three-row option, as stipulated by the rules of urban planning. In the option with three rows of trees, the effect of hedgerows located beneath the trees and that of various tree species was investigated as well.\n\nParticle size also matters\n\nThe attachment of particles to vegetation does reduce the particle concentration in the air, but the effect is slimmer than the increase brought about the deceleration of wind, or the reduced ventilation of the street canyon. The smallest aerosol particles were more apt to bind with vegetation compared to the larger ones, which is why increasing the number of trees increased the number of the smallest particles found in the air less than that of larger particles.\n\nWith trees of uniform height in three rows, the concentration of small particles under 10 micrometres in size grew by 88%, with even the concentration of particles under 2.5 micrometres increasing 42% compared to the entirely treeless street canyon. The option with three rows of trees with different heights, which was the cleanest option, increased the concentration of small particles under 10 micrometres by 75% and that of small particles under 2.5 micrometres by 35%.\n\nThe study applied the high-quality PALM model designed for air quality modelling, which enables the assessment of air quality differences with a very fine resolution, that is, to a high degree of precision. The modelling was carried out with the CSC supercomputer, as a regular desktop computer would have spent roughly a year to compute each option, altogether some 12 years taking all wind direction and tree options into consideration.

In order to make this practicable, it is necessary to develop foundation technologies to optimize the potential of the photocatalysts, in addition to finding new materials for catalysts.\n\nThis time, Tachikawa et al. successfully produced a photoanode with an extremely high conductivity. This was achieved solely by annealing hematite (*2) mesocrystals (*3, superstructures consisting of tiny nanoparticles of approx. 5nm) to a transparent electrode substrate. Hematite can absorb a wide range of visible light and is safe, stable, and inexpensive. With this photoanode, the electrons and holes produced by the light source separated quickly and, at the same time, a large number of holes densely accumulated on the surface of the particles. The accumulation of holes improved the efficiency of the water oxidation reaction; the slow oxidation of the water has previously been a bottleneck in water-splitting.\n\nIn addition to boosting the high efficiency of what is thought to be the world's highest performing photoanode, this strategy will also be applied to artificial photosynthesis and solar water-splitting technologies via collaborations between the university and industries.\n\nThese results will be published in the German online chemistry journal 'Angewandte Chemie International Edition' on April 30. This work was also featured in the inside cover.\n\nMain points:\n\nNumerous oxygen vacancies (*5) were formed inside the hematite mesocrystals by accumulating and sintering tiny highly-orientated nanoparticles of less than 10 nanometers.\n\nThe presence of oxygen vacancies improved the conductivity of the photocatalyst electrode, at the same time giving it a significant surface potential gradient, thereby promoting the separation of electrons and holes.\n\nAt the same time a large amount of holes moved to the surface of the particles, allowing a high rate of oxygen evolution from water. This enabled the researchers to achieve the world's highest solar water-splitting performance for hematite anodes.\n\nThis strategy can be applied to a wide range of photocatalysts, beginning with solar water-splitting.\n\nResearch Background\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith the world facing increasing environmental and energy issues, hydrogen has gained attention as one of the possible next generation energy sources. Ideally, photocatalysts could be used to convert water and sunlight into hydrogen. However, a solar energy conversion rate of over 10% is necessary to enable such a system to be adopted industrially. Utilizing Japan's strengths in new materials discovery, it is vital to establish a common foundation technology that can unlock the potential of photocatalysts in order to achieve this aim.\n\nPreviously, Tachikawa et al. developed 'mesocrystal technology', which involves precisely aligning nanoparticles in photocatalysts to control the flow of electrons and their holes. Recently, they applied this technology to hematite (a-Fe2O3), and succeeded in dramatically increasing the conversion rate.\n\nThis time, they were able to raise the conversion rate up to 42% of its theoretical limit (16%) by synthesizing tiny nanoparticle subunits in the hematite.\n\nResearch methodology\n\nMesocrystal technology:\n\nThe main problem that causes a conversion rate decline in photocatalytic reactions is that the electrons and holes produced by light recombine before they can react with the molecules (in this case, water) on the surface. Tachikawa et al. created hematite mesocrystal superstructures with highly oriented nanoparticles via solvothermal synthesis (*7). They were able to develop conductive mesocrystal photoanodes for water splitting by accumulating and sintering mesocrystals onto the transparent electrode substrate.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPhotocatalyst formation and performance:\n\nMesocrystal photoanodes were produced by coating the transparent electrode substrate with hematite mesocrystals containing titanium and then annealing them at 700\u00baC. A co-catalyst (*8) was deposited on the surface of the mesocrystals. When the photocatalysts were placed in an alkaline solution and illuminated with artificial sunlight, the water-splitting reaction took place at a photocurrent density of 5.5mAcm-2 under an applied voltage of 1.23V. This is the highest performance achieved in the world for hematite, which is one of the most ideal photocatalyst materials due to both its low cost and light absorption properties. In addition, the hematite mesocrystal photoanodes functioned stably during repeated experiments over the course of 100 hours.\n\nThe key to achieving a high conversion rate is the size of the nanoparticles that make up the mesocrystal structure. It is possible to greatly increase the amount of oxygen vacancies that form during the sintering process by making the nanoparticles as small as 5 nm and increasing the connecting interfaces between the nanoparticles. This boosted the electron density, and significantly increased the conductivity of the mesocrystals.\n\nThe high electron density is connected to the formation of a large band bending (*9) near the mesocrystal surface. This promotes the initial charge separation as well as making it easier for holes to accumulate on the surface. This result was optimized due to the tiny nanoparticle structure of the mesocrystals, and boosted the water oxidation reaction that had been a bottleneck for efficient water-splitting.\n\nFurther Research\n\nThis study revealed that mesocrystal technology is able to significantly minimize the recombination issue, which is the main cause of low efficiency in photocatalysts, and exponentially accelerate the water splitting reaction.\n\nIt is hoped that this strategy can be applied to other metal oxides as well. Next, the researchers will collaborate with industries to optimize the hematite mesocrystal photoanodes and implement an industrial system for producing hydrogen from solar light. At the same time, the strategy developed by this study will be applied to various reactions, including artificial photosynthesis.\n\nGlossary\n\n1. Photocatalyst: A material that can be utilized as a catalyst for reactions involving light illumination. The photocatalyst is applied to a substrate which absorbs the light. Used as an electrode, it can also be called a photocatalyst anode or a photoanode. In this study, a photocatalyst was used for the reaction to produce hydrogen by splitting the water molecules.\n\n2. Hematite: A type of iron oxide ore. In addition to being safe, inexpensive and stable (pH > 3), Hematite can absorb a wide range of visible light (approx. under 600nm). The theoretical limit of its solar energy conversation efficiency is 16% (a photocurrent density of 13mAcm-2).\n\n3. Mesocrystal: Porous crystal superstructures consisting of nanoparticles that are highly aligned. Hundreds of nanometers or micrometers small, they feature pores between the nanoparticles that are between 2 to 50 nanometers.\n\n4. Artificial photosynthesis: Method to artificially recreate photosynthesis, which is how plants convert sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. Artificial photosynthesis can also be used to produce other useful compounds.\n\n5. Oxygen vacancy: Inside the mesocrystal structure, there are spaces where there is no oxygen, these are called oxygen vacancies (Vo). In hematite, the creation of these oxygen vacancies enhances electrical conductivity because Fe3+ is deoxygenated, becoming Fe2+ (the oxygen molecules move to fill the vacancies).\n\n6. Light energy conversion efficiency: The amount of light particles used in the reaction (output) divided by the amount of inputted light particles. This is expressed as a percentage.\n\n7. Solvothermal method: A method of synthesizing solids using solvents at high temperatures and high pressures.\n\n8. Co-catalyst: A substance used alongside the photocatalyst to boost the catalytic reaction. In this study, Cobalt phosphate ion (Co-Pi) was used as a co-catalyst to boost oxygen production.\n\n9. Band: The conductive band and valence band are bands that the electrons and their holes can occupy. In semiconductors, there is a small bandgap between valence band and conduction band, allowing a reasonable number of valence electrons to move into the conduction band when a certain amount of energy is applied. When the electron density in the conduction band increases, they move towards the surface, forming an upwards curve.\n\n10.

As biologists from the Alfred Wegener Institute report in the latest issue of the journal Nature Communications, between 1988 and 2014, total benthic biomass on the continental shelf of the northeast Weddell Sea declined by two thirds. In addition, the composition of the benthos changed drastically, and the ecosystem's productivity suffered. This period coincides with a significant increase in sea-ice cover in the region, a trend that peaked in 2014.\n\nThe Antarctic is home to a unique variety of benthic fauna, with an extraordinarily diverse range of species, and many groups of organisms that are rarely if ever found in other marine regions. Predators like large crabs are nowhere to be seen; as a result, sponges and gorgonians (soft corals), which normally have to hide in the sediment to avoid predators, can grow in denser clumps. In fact, in some areas of the Antarctic continental shelf these species cover the ocean floor like a carpet. They have adapted to conditions of extreme cold and scarce food, and grow slowly, which allows them to reach unusual sizes and ages. \"Due to their slow growth, changes in the structure and composition of benthic communities in the Antarctic are extremely difficult to detect,\" explains Prof. Claudio Richter, a biologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI). \"Consequently, to date it's been impossible to predict how benthic communities in the Antarctic would react to climate-based changes in their environment,\" says the co-author, who is a Professor of Marine Animal Ecology at the University of Bremen.\n\nIn the current issue of the journal Nature Communications, the AWI biologists show that, over a 26-year-long timeframe, benthic biomass on the continental shelf of the Antarctic Weddell Sea steadily declined. The team began their work back in the 1980s, collecting samples from the seafloor when the research icebreaker Polarstern first visited the region. One of the study's authors, Dieter Gerdes, was among the pioneers, and developed a sample-gathering device specifically for this type of research: the two-metric-ton multibox corer, which can simultaneously collect nine seafloor samples every time it is deployed. From 1988 to 2014, the behemoth was used 59 times in the Kapp Norvegia/Aust\u00e5sen research area, located 81 miles southwest of Germany's Neumayer research station. In the course of eight Polarstern expeditions, the experts gathered more than 300 seafloor samples, sifted through 45 metric tons of sediment, and sorted and counted tens of thousands of marine organisms. \"The side effects of our study were aching limbs and ending up covered in mud from head to toe on the freezing working deck, not to mention a good deal of eye strain from too much time behind the microscope,\" reports Claudio Richter, offering a tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the demanding working conditions on the Antarctic expeditions.\n\nThe study's first author, Santiago Pineda-Metz, an Argentinean student from the Universidad de Magallanes in Chile, dedicated a major section of his doctoral dissertation at the University of Bremen to developing the statistics needed in order to analyse the diverse range of data. In addition, he compared the data gathered by the team with that from global archives in order to map their biological findings to changes in the Antarctic environment during the research period. The researchers analysed how various factors, e.g. iceberg 'keels' scraping along the seafloor, collapsing ice shelves, the amount of sea-ice cover and snow atop it, as well as the prevalence of icebergs in a 'whitening Antarctic' affect benthic fauna and ecosystem productivity. What they found: though icebergs adversely affect productivity, there were no major changes in their abundance during the research period. In contrast, the increased sea-ice cover and thicker snow cover produced concrete negative effects.\n\n\"We had always suspected that the sea ice might be the key,\" says project leader Claudio Richter. \"The Antarctic is quite different from the Arctic: in the Arctic, the sea ice is disappearing. But in the vast majority of the Antarctic, until recently the sea ice was growing. More snow-covered ice floes means: less light to support the growth of tiny algae (phytoplankton) at the water's surface, and less dead phytoplankton that drifts down to the bottom. In this 'whitening Antarctic', benthic organisms can sometimes go hungry.\" Pineda-Metz, Gerdes and Richter have succeeded in finding evidence of precisely this trend: they confirmed a substantial loss in both the frequency and biomass of Antarctic benthos in the research area. In addition, they determined that there was a shift in the community, from suspension feeders to deposit feeders.\n\nThe year 2014 marked both the end of data gathering and a possible turning point for the Antarctic sea-ice cover, which has since dropped from its all-time maximum back then to roughly the same levels as in the 1980s. The AWI team is currently preparing for an expedition in early 2021, where they will investigate whether sea-ice retreat has reversed the above-mentioned effects on the benthos. They plan to return to past sample-gathering sites in order to see if benthic organisms have bounced back under the recent ice-poor conditions. \"Exploring the benthic reaction is extremely important since carbon storage in the benthos represents an important feedback for the climate system,\" says Pineda-Metz, who intends to focus on this reaction in his postdoctoral thesis. \"Our study also shows how important long-term ecological monitoring is when it comes to a region that is vulnerable to rising temperatures,\" Richter adds.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507130715.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T17:07:15", "title": "Accurate 3D imaging of sperm cells moving at top speed could improve IVF treatments", "text": "Tel Aviv University (TAU) researchers have developed a safe and accurate 3D imaging method to identify sperm cells moving at a high speed.\n\nThe research, a study of which was published in Science Advances on April 10, was led by Prof. Natan Shaked of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at TAU's Faculty of Engineering together with TAU doctoral student Gili Dardikman-Yoffe.\n\nThe new technology could provide doctors with the ability to select the highest-quality sperm for injection into an egg during IVF treatment, potentially increasing a woman's chance of becoming pregnant and giving birth to a healthy baby.\n\n\"The IVF procedure was invented to help fertility problems,\" explains Prof. Shaked. \"The most common type of IVF today is intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), which involves sperm selection by a clinical embryologist and injection into the woman's egg. To that end, an effort is made to select the sperm cell that is most likely to create a healthy embryo.\"\n\nUnder natural fertilization in the woman's body, the fastest sperm to reach an egg is supposed to bear high-quality genetic material. Progressive movement allows this \"best\" sperm to overcome the veritable obstacle course of a woman's reproductive system.\n\n\"But this 'natural selection' is not available to the embryologist, who selects a sperm and injects it into the egg,\" Prof. Shaked says. \"Sperm cells not only move fast, they are also mostly transparent under regular light microscopy, and cell staining is not allowed in human IVF. Existing imaging technology that can examine the quality of the sperm's genetic material may cause embryonic damage, so that too is prohibited. In the absence of more precise criteria, sperm cells are selected primarily according to external characteristics and their motility while swimming in water in a dish, which is very different from the natural environment of a woman's body.\n\n\"In our study, we sought to develop an entirely new type of imaging technology that would provide as much information as possible about individual sperm cells, does not require cell staining to enhance contrast, and has the potential for enabling the selection of optimal sperm in fertilization treatments.\"\n\nThe researchers chose light computed tomography (CT) technology for the unique task of sperm cell imaging.\n\n\"In a standard medical CT scan, the device rotates around the subject and sends out X-rays that produce multiple projections, ultimately creating a 3D image of the body,\" says Prof. Shaked. \"In the case of the sperm, instead of rotating the device around this tiny subject, we relied on a natural feature of the sperm itself: Its head is constantly rotating during the forward movement. We used weak light (and not X-rays), which does not damage the cell. We recorded a hologram of the sperm cell during ultrafast movement and identified various internal components according to their refractive index. This creates an accurate, highly dynamic 3D map of its contents without using cell staining.\"\n\nUsing this technique, the researchers obtained a clear and accurate CT image of the sperm at very high resolution in four dimensions: three dimensions in the space at resolution of less than half a micron (one micron equals one millionth of a meter) and the exact time (motion) dimension of the second sub-millisecond.\n\n\"Our new development provides a comprehensive solution to many known problems of sperm imaging,\" Prof. Shaked says. \"We were able to create high-resolution imaging of the sperm head while it was moving fast, without the need for stains that could harm the embryo. The new technology can greatly improve the selection of sperm cells in vitro, potentially increasing the chance of pregnancy and the birth of a healthy baby.\n\n\"To help diagnose male fertility problems, we intend to use our new technique to shed light on the relationship between the 3D movement, structure and contents of sperm and its ability to fertilize an egg and produce a viable pregnancy,\" Prof. Shaked concludes. \"We believe that such imaging capabilities will contribute to other medical applications, such as developing efficient biomimetic micro-robots to carry drugs within the body.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507130708.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T17:07:08", "title": "2D oxide flakes pick up surprise electrical properties: Lab detects piezoelectric effects in nanosheets due to defects", "text": "Rice University researchers have found evidence of piezoelectricity in lab-grown, two-dimensional flakes of molybdenum dioxide.\n\nTheir investigation showed the surprise electrical properties are due to electrons trapped in defects throughout the material, which is less than 10 nanometers thick. They characterize these charges as electrets, which appear in some insulating materials and generate internal and external electric fields.\n\nPiezoelectricity is likewise a property of materials that respond to stress by generating an electric voltage across their surfaces or generate mechanical strain in response to an applied electric field. It has many practical and scientific uses, from the conversion of a wiggling guitar string into an electrical signal to scanning microscopes like those used to make the new finding.\n\nThe researchers at Rice's Brown School of Engineering found their micron-scale flakes exhibit a piezoelectric response that is as strong as that observed in such conventional 2D piezoelectric materials as molybdenum disulfide. The report by Rice materials scientist Pulickel Ajayan and collaborators appears in Advanced Materials.\n\nThe key appears to be defects that make molybdenum dioxide's crystal lattice imperfect. When strained, the dipoles of electrons trapped in these defects seem to align, as with other piezoelectric materials, creating an electric field leading to the observed effect.\n\n\"Super thin, 2D crystals continue to show surprises, as in our study,\" Ajayan said. \"Defect engineering is a key to engineer properties of such materials but is often challenging and hard to control.\"\n\n\"Molybdenum dioxide isn't expected to show any piezoelectricity,\" added Rice postdoctoral researcher Anand Puthirath, a co-corresponding author of the paper. \"But because we're making the material as thin as possible, confinement effects come into the picture.\"\n\nHe said the effect appears in molybdenum dioxide flakes grown by chemical vapor deposition.

The strata of rock tell scientists about past environments, much like pages in an encyclopedia. Except this reference book has more pages missing than it has remaining. So geologists are tasked not only with understanding what is there, but also with figuring out what's not, and where it went.\n\nOne omission in particular has puzzled scientists for well over a century. First noticed by John Wesley Powell in 1869 in the layers of the Grand Canyon, the Great Unconformity, as it's known, accounts for more than one billion years of missing rock in certain places.\n\nScientists have developed several hypotheses to explain how, and when, this staggering amount of material may have been eroded. Now, UC Santa Barbara geologist Francis Macdonald and his colleagues at the University of Colorado, Boulder and at Colorado College believe they may have ruled out one of the more popular of these. Their study appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\"There are unconformities all through the rock record,\" explained Macdonald, a professor in the Department of Earth Science. \"Unconformities are just gaps in time within the rock record. This one's called the Great Unconformity because it was thought to be a particularly large gap, maybe a global gap.\"\n\nA leading thought is that glaciers scoured away kilometers of rock around 720 to 635 million years ago, during a time known as Snowball Earth, when the planet was completely covered by ice. This hypothesis even has the benefit of helping to explain the rapid emergence of complex organisms shortly thereafter, in the Cambrian explosion, since all this eroded material could have seeded the oceans with tremendous amounts of nutrients.\n\nMacdonald was skeptical of this reasoning. Although analogues of the Great Unconformity appear throughout the world -- with similar amounts of rock missing from similar stretches of time -- they don't line up perfectly. This casts doubt as to whether they were truly eroded by a global event like Snowball Earth.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPart of the challenge of investigating the Great Unconformity is that it happened so long ago, and the Earth is a messy system. \"These rocks have been buried and eroded multiple times through their history,\" Macdonald said.\n\nFortunately, the team was able to test this hypothesis using a technique called thermochronology. A few kilometers below the Earth's surface, the temperature begins to rise as you get closer to the planet's hot mantle. This creates a temperature gradient of roughly 50 degrees Celsius for every kilometer of depth. And this temperature regime can become imprinted in certain minerals.\n\nAs certain radioactive elements in rocks break down, Helium-4 is produced. In fact helium is constantly being generated, but the fraction retained in different minerals is a function of temperature. As a result, scientists can use the ratio of helium to thorium and uranium in certain minerals as a paleo-thermometer. This phenomenon enabled Macdonald and his coauthors to track how rock moved in the crust as it was buried and eroded through the ages.\n\n\"These unconformities are forming again and again through tectonic processes,\" Macdonald said. \"What's really new is we can now access this much older history.\"\n\nThe team took samples from granite just below the boundary of the Great Unconformity at Pikes Peak in Colorado. They extracted grains of a particularly resilient mineral, zircon, from the stone and analyzed the radio nucleotides of helium contained inside. The technique revealed that several kilometers of rock had been eroded from above this granite between 1,000 and 720 million years ago.\n\nadvertisement\n\nImportantly, this stretch of time definitively came before the Snowball Earth episodes. In fact, it lines up much better with the periods in which the supercontinent Rodinia was forming and breaking apart. This offers a clue to the processes that may have stricken these years from the geologic record.\n\n\"The basic hypothesis is that this large-scale erosion was driven by the formation and separation of supercontinents,\" Macdonald said.\n\nThe Earth's cycle of supercontinent formation and separation uplifts and erodes incredible extents of rock over long periods of time. And because supercontinent processes, by definition, involve a lot of land, their effects can appear fairly synchronous across the geologic record.\n\nHowever, these processes don't happen simultaneously, as they would in a global event like Snowball Earth. \"It's a messy process,\" Macdonald said. \"There are differences, and now we have the ability to perhaps resolve those differences and pull that record out.\"\n\nWhile Macdonald's results are consistent with a tectonic origin for these great unconformities, they don't end the debate. Geologists will need to complement this work with similar studies in other regions of the world in order to better constrain these events.\n\nThe mystery of the Great Unconformity is inherently tied to two of geology's other great enigmas: the rise and fall of Snowball Earth and the sudden emergence of complex life in the Ediacaran and Cambrian. Progress in any one could help researchers finally crack the lot.\n\n\"The Cambrian explosion was Darwin's dilemma,\" Macdonald remarked. \"This is a 200-year old question.

Differences in mortality exist even if one looks across the same age group.

Not only does vitamin D enhance our innate immune systems, it also prevents our immune systems from becoming dangerously overactive. This means that having healthy levels of vitamin D could protect patients against severe complications, including death, from COVID-19.\n\n\"Our analysis shows that it might be as high as cutting the mortality rate in half,\" Backman said. \"It will not prevent a patient from contracting the virus, but it may reduce complications and prevent death in those who are infected.\"\n\nBackman said this correlation might help explain the many mysteries surrounding COVID-19, such as why children are less likely to die. Children do not yet have a fully developed acquired immune system, which is the immune system's second line of defense and more likely to overreact.\n\n\"Children primarily rely on their innate immune system,\" Backman said. \"This may explain why their mortality rate is lower.\"\n\nBackman is careful to note that people should not take excessive doses of vitamin D, which might come with negative side effects. He said the subject needs much more research to know how vitamin D could be used most effectively to protect against COVID-19 complications.\n\n\"It is hard to say which dose is most beneficial for COVID-19,\" Backman said. \"However, it is clear that vitamin D deficiency is harmful, and it can be easily addressed with appropriate supplementation. This might be another key to helping protect vulnerable populations, such as African-American and elderly patients, who have a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.\"\n\nBackman is the director of Northwestern's Center for Physical Genomics and Engineering and the associate director for Research Technology and Infrastructure at the Robert H.

Despite intensive research, however, we still lack the necessary basic understanding to develop these complex materials for widespread application. \"Higgs spectroscopy\" could bring about a watershed as it reveals the dynamics of paired electrons in superconductors.\n\nAn international research consortium centered around the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) and the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research (MPI-FKF) is now presenting the new measuring method in the journal Nature Communications. Remarkably, the dynamics also reveal typical precursors of superconductivity even above the critical temperature at which the materials investigated attain superconductivity.\n\nSuperconductors transport electric current without a loss of energy. Utilizing them could dramatically reduce our energy requirements -- if it weren't for the fact that superconductivity requires temperatures of -140 degrees Celsius and below. Materials only 'turn on' their superconductivity below this point. All known superconductors require elaborate cooling methods, which makes them impractical for everyday purposes. There is promise of progress in high temperature superconductors such as cuprates -- innovative materials based on copper oxide. The problem is that despite many years of research efforts, their exact mode of operation remains unclear. Higgs spectroscopy might change that.\n\nHiggs spectroscopy allows new insights into high-temperature superconductivity\n\n\"Higgs spectroscopy offers us a whole new 'magnifying glass' to examine the physical processes,\" Dr. Jan-Christoph Deinert reports. The researcher at the HZDR Institute of Radiation Physics is working on the new method alongside colleagues from the MPI-FKF, the Universities of Stuttgart and Tokyo, and other international research institutions. What the scientists are most keen to find out is how electrons form pairs in high-temperature superconductors.\n\nIn superconductivity, electrons combine to create \"Cooper pairs,\" which enables them to move through the material in pairs without any interaction with their environment. But what makes two electrons pair up when their charge actually makes them repel each other? For conventional superconductors, there is a physical explanation: \"The electrons pair up because of crystal lattice vibrations,\" explains Prof. Stefan Kaiser, one of the main authors of the study, who is researching the dynamics in superconductors at MPI-FKF and the University of Stuttgart. One electron distorts the crystal lattice, which then attracts the second electron. For cuprates, however, it has so far been unclear which mechanism acts in the place of lattice vibrations. \"One hypothesis is that the pairing is due to fluctuating spins, i.e. magnetic interaction,\" Kaiser explains. \"But the key question is: Can their influence on superconductivity and in particular on the properties of the Cooper pairs be measured directly?\"\n\nAt this point \"Higgs oscillations\" enter the stage: In high-energy physics, they explain why elementary particles have mass. But they also occur in superconductors, where they can be excited by strong laser pulses. They represent the oscillations of the order parameter -- the measure of a material's superconductive state, in other words, the density of the Cooper pairs. So much for the theory. A first experimental proof succeeded a few years ago when researchers at the University of Tokyo used an ultrashort light pulse to excite Higgs oscillations in conventional superconductors -- like setting a pendulum in motion. For high-temperature superconductors, however, such a one-off pulse is not enough, as the system is damped too much by interactions between the superconducting and non-superconducting electrons and the complicated symmetry of the ordering parameter.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTerahertz light source keeps the system oscillating\n\nThanks to Higgs spectroscopy, the research consortium around MPI-FKF and HZDR has now achieved the experimental breakthrough for high-temperature superconductors. Their trick was to use a multi-cyclic, extremely strong terahertz pulse that is optimally tuned to Higgs oscillation and can maintain it despite the damping factors -- continuously prodding the metaphorical pendulum. With the high-performance terahertz light source TELBE at HZDR, the researchers are able to send 100,000 such pulses through the samples per second. \"Our source is unique in the world due to its high intensity in the terahertz range combined with a very high repetition rate,\" Deinert explains. \"We can now selectively drive Higgs oscillations and measure them very precisely.\"\n\nThis success is owed to close cooperation between theoretical and experimental scientists. The idea was hatched at MPI-FKF; the experiment was conducted by the TELBE team, led by Dr. Jan-Christoph Deinert and Dr. Sergey Kovalev at HZDR under then group leader Prof. Michael Gensch, who is now researching at the German Aerospace Center and TU Berlin: \"The experiments are of particular importance for the scientific application of large-scale research facilities in general. They demonstrate that a high-power terahertz source such as TELBE can handle a complex investigation using nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy on a complicated series of samples, such as cuprates.\"\n\nThat is why the research team expects to see high demand in the future: \"Higgs spectroscopy as a methodological approach opens up entirely new potentials,\" explains Dr. Hao Chu, primary author of the study and postdoc at the Max Planck-UBC-UTokyo Center for Quantum Materials. \"It is the starting point for a series of experiments that will provide new insights into these complex materials. We can now take a very systematic approach.\"\n\nJust above the critical temperature: Where does superconductivity start?\n\nConducting several series of measurements, the researchers first proved that their method works for typical cuprates. Below the critical temperature, the research team was not only able to excite Higgs oscillations, but also proved that a new, previously unobserved excitation interacts with the Cooper pairs' Higgs oscillations. Further experiments will have to reveal whether these interactions are magnetic interactions, as is fiercely debated in expert circles. Furthermore, the researchers saw indications that Cooper pairs can also form above the critical temperature, albeit without oscillating together. Other measuring methods have previously suggested the possibility of such early pair formation. Higgs spectroscopy could support this hypothesis and clarify when and how the pairs form and what causes them to oscillate together in the superconductor.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm", "published": "2020-05-07T14:44:46", "title": "Global trade in soy has major implications for climate: Study examines carbon emissions from Brazilian soy exports with unprecedented accuracy", "text": "The extent to which Brazilian soy production and trade contribute to climate change depends largely on the location where soybeans are grown. This is shown by a recent study conducted by the University of Bonn together with partners from Spain, Belgium and Sweden. In some municipalities, CO 2 emissions resulting from the export of soybean and derivatives are more than 200 times higher than in others. Between 2010 and 2015, the EU imported soy primarily from locations where large forest and savannah areas had previously been converted into agricultural land. The analysis is published in the journal Global Environmental Change.\n\nGlobal soy trade is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions for multiple reasons. The conversion of natural vegetation into arable land is probably the most important cause, since the latter generally binds considerably less CO 2 than the original ecosystems. Greenhouse gases are also released during the harvesting of soybeans and processing into derived products, the subsequent transport to ports of export and shipment.\n\nTo estimate the carbon footprint embodied in Brazil's soy exports, researchers used the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. This allows quantifying the environmental footprint of a product, from its production until it is delivered to the importer. The researchers from the Institute for Food and Resource Economics (ILR) of the University of Bonn have performed this analysis for almost 90,000 supply chains that were identified in total soy exports from Brazil in the period 2010-2015. \"Each of these 90,000 individual trade flows represents a specific combination of the producing municipality in Brazil, the location in which the soy was stored and pre-processed, the respective export and import ports, and, where applicable, the country where further processing takes place,\" explains the ILR researcher Dr Neus Escobar. \"Put more simply, we have calculated the quantity of carbon dioxide released per tonne of soy exported through each of these supply chains.\"\n\nAround 90,000 soy trade flows analysed\n\nFor this purpose, the researchers used a database developed at the Stockholm Environment Institute. It traces the trade routes of agricultural commodity exports from the production region to the importer in detail. \"The database also contains spatially-explicit information on the deforestation associated with the soy cultivation in the production region,\" says Escobar. \"We supplemented it with additional data, for instance, on means of transport involved in the corresponding export route, as well as their CO 2 emission intensity. This enabled us to make a very detailed assessment of the impact of soy cultivation in Brazil and subsequent transport on global greenhouse gas emissions.\" Interestingly, results show that: \"The resulting greenhouse gas emissions vary considerably from municipality to municipality, depending on underlying deforestation, cultivation practices and freight logistics,\" emphasizes Escobar. \"The carbon footprint of some municipalities is more than 200 times larger than others. The variability is therefore much higher than so far reported in scientific literature.\"\n\nThe greatest CO 2 emissions arise from the so-called MATOPIBA region in the northeast of the country. This region still has large areas covered with natural vegetation, particularly forests and savannahs, which have however been increasingly lost to agriculture in recent years. Furthermore, soy exports from municipalities in this region usually entail long transport distances to the ports of export, which are mostly covered by trucks due to the relatively poor infrastructure. Thus, greenhouse gas emissions from transport can be substantial and even surpass the effects of deforestation.\n\nThe researchers also investigated which countries generate particularly large quantities of greenhouse gas emissions by importing soy. First and foremost, the world's largest importer is China, however, the European Union does not fall far behind. \"Although European countries imported considerably smaller amounts of soy, between 2010 and 2015, this came primarily from areas where sizeable deforestation took place,\" notes Escobar.\n\n\"Regional factors can have a significant influence on the environmental impacts embodied in global agricultural trade,\" explains the researcher. \"Our study helps to shed light on such relationships.\" Policymakers urgently need such information: It can help to design low-carbon supply chains, for instance with improvements in the transport infrastructure or more effective forest conservation policies. Furthermore, it can also inform consumers about the environmental implications of high meat consumption, such as in many EU countries: A large proportion of the soy imported by Europe is used as animal feed.", "author": []}]}, "economist_business": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/business-finance/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/business", "articles": []}, "economist_science_and_tech": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/science-technology/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/science", "articles": []}, "fivethirtyeight_science": {"rss": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/feed/", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/", "articles": [{"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-didnt-wait-for-their-governors-to-tell-them-to-stay-home-because-of-covid-19/", "published": "2020-05-08T19:14:52", "title": "Americans Didn\u2019t Wait For Their Governors To Tell Them To Stay Home Because Of COVID-19", "text": "A favorite new debate taking place around the Twitter hearth is whether complying with social distancing guidelines is a partisan statement in and of itself. Blue states, such as Washington and New York, were initially hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis, and stay-at-home orders went into effect as early as March 19 (California was first out of the gate). A number of red states have refrained from implementing such public-safety orders, and many Republican-leaning states, particularly in the South, didn\u2019t issue orders for weeks afterward \u2014 as late as April 3 in Florida and Georgia. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis waffled over closing the state but eventually did so under pressure from state lawmakers.\n\nBut, at least on the front end of this crisis, Americans weren\u2019t deciding what to do based on politics. Americans living in red states appear to have taken the crisis plenty seriously; data shows that residents there were staying home well before their governors issued stay-at-home orders.\n\nCuebiq, a private data company, assessed the movement of people via GPS-enabled mobile devices across the U.S. If you look at movement data in a cross-section of states President Trump won in the southeast in 2016 \u2014 Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and Kentucky \u2014 23 percent of people were staying home on average during the first week of March. That proportion jumped to 47 percent a month later across these six states.\n\nIf defying social distancing orders were really a political statement, you\u2019d think that the southeast would be a hotbed for dissent. Yet people in the six states we examined changed their behavior around mid-March, before the states\u2019 official stay-at-home orders. In fact, about 90 percent of the total change between early March and mid-April had occurred in the week before the stay-at-home orders were passed in each state.\n\nThat\u2019s more or less in line with the country at large, as you can see in the chart below.\n\nAlmost uniformly across these states, people started staying home beginning on March 14. The percentage of people staying home rose rapidly over the following nine days and tended to plateau by March 23.\n\nThe Cuebiq data suggests that behavioral changes were largely driven by people making a voluntary choice to stay home rather than being forced to do so by a state-sanctioned stay-at-home order. One need only look at the behavior of residents in North Carolina and their neighbors in South Carolina: While North Carolina issued a stay-at-home order eight days before South Carolina, a stabilized number of people in both states started staying at home about a week before North Carolina\u2019s order.\n\nWhy did people begin to stay at home so early? In mid-March, the seriousness of the virus had begun to permeate the national and international conversation. On March 9, the Dow dropped to its lowest point since the 2008 financial crisis. Earlier that same day, Italy announced a nationwide lockdown. On March 11, the NBA announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely, a sign to many Americans that the pandemic would indeed change all facets of life, and on March 12, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Some of the earliest official actions in the U.S. occurred around that time in the state of Washington, when Gov. Jay Inslee announced on March 11 a ban in three counties on gatherings of more than 250 people and public schools in Seattle also announced they would close. Many other U.S. cities closed schools, restaurants and bars in rapid succession around March 16.\n\nThis sort of mass behavioral change in such a short time is significant. It took over 50 years and hundreds of billions of dollars in prevention efforts to lower the percentage of people who smoke in the U.S. from 42 percent in 1965 to 13 percent in 2018. Americans reacted to the threat of COVID-19 in a relative blink of an eye.\n\nThe question that now looms, of course, is whether Americans\u2019 individual behavioral changes will last as the pandemic wears on and the summer sun beckons.

The total count of positive cases now stands at more than 1.2 million, according to numbers from The COVID Tracking Project.\n\nIn our effort to make sense of the range of possible outcomes for the outbreak, we\u2019ve continued to follow the results of a weekly survey of infectious-disease researchers from institutions around the United States. In this week\u2019s survey, conducted May 4 and 5, experts predict that the total number of positive cases in the U.S. will be more than 1.3 million and less than 1.45 million on May 10. The experts also forecast a total of 255,500 deaths attributed to the coronavirus by the end of 2020.\n\nThe survey is organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Respondents are asked to provide their best estimate, as well as a best-case and worst-case possibility. Structuring the survey in this way lets the organizers generate probabilistic consensus forecasts, a tool that can answer questions about how likely various scenarios are.\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts had to say this week.\n\nHow many confirmed cases will be reported by May 10?\n\nLast week, the consensus from the experts was that there would be between 1 million and 1.15 million confirmed U.S. cases by May 3. The reported number of 1,152,006 fell just outside that range, according to The COVID Tracking Project. This week, the researchers were asked to predict the number of confirmed cases by May 10. The expert consensus put the most probable range between 1.3 million and 1.45 million cases. (Like last week, the researchers were given five distinct ranges of total confirmed cases and asked to assign a probability to each bin.)\n\nHow many U.S. jurisdictions will report more new cases in September than in June?\n\nIn a new question, the experts were asked to forecast out to September and predict how many states and territories (plus the District of Columbia) would report more new COVID-19 cases in that month than they did in June. Questions like this require two separate predictions, with one largely conditional on the other. This increases the difficulty and uncertainty of the forecasts.\n\nAccordingly, the distribution of answers given by the experts is more uniform across the range of possible outcomes. But in the mass of uncertainty, there is perhaps some good news: As summer stretches into fall, experts assigned the highest probability to fewer than four states reporting more new coronavirus cases than they had in June.\n\nWhat will happen in Texas?\n\nOn May 1, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott allowed his stay-at-home order to expire. In the most recent seven-day period for which the state is reporting data \u2014 April 30 through May 6 \u2014 the average daily new case count is 1,053. The panel of experts were asked to forecast the average number of new daily cases in Texas during the week ending on June 13.\n\nThe experts predict that the new seven-day daily average in Texas is most likely to rise to between 1,350 and 1,800, affirming the widely held belief that social distancing measures have been effective at containing the spread of the disease. Experts placed a slightly smaller probability on the chances of Texas seeing between 900 and 1,350 new daily cases, on average.\n\nMeanwhile, most experts believe that the average new daily case count would have fallen under the stricter stay-at-home guidelines that Texas previously had in place. The experts forecast a 31 percent probability that the average number of new cases would have been between 675 and 900 had the stay-at-home order not been allowed to expire.\n\nHow many deaths will there be by year\u2019s end?\n\nFinally, the experts were asked to forecast the total number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 by the end of 2020. The consensus estimate is that 255,500 die, with a 90 percent chance of the death total falling between 118,750 and 1,211,500 \u2014 a large range.\n\nThe low end of the expert\u2019s range may be optimistic, however. The FiveThirtyEight model roundup shows that most models project 100,000 or more deaths by the end of May. Modeling the virus continues to be incredibly challenging, so it\u2019s difficult to know which set of expectations to weight more heavily. But with uncertainty still high and spring in the air, perhaps some optimism in this moment is warranted \u2014 or at least forgivable.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Josh Hermsmeyer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-scientists-think-the-novel-coronavirus-developed-naturally-not-in-a-chinese-lab/", "published": "2020-05-04T18:58:42", "title": "Why Scientists Think The Novel Coronavirus Developed Naturally \u2014 Not In A Chinese Lab", "text": "You could be forgiven for wondering how a disease as fast-moving and deadly as COVID-19 could just appear naturally, out of nowhere, seemingly overnight. President Trump expressed doubt, saying that \u201ca lot of people\u201d were looking at the possibility that a Chinese lab was responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier that week, Fox News ran a story in which unnamed sources suggested that the COVID-19 outbreak originated in a Wuhan laboratory \u2014 the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses with a number of international collaborators. The New York Times reported that spy agencies are being pressured to find evidence blaming the lab, and at the end of April, the National Institutes of Health withdrew funding from a research consortium that had collaborated with the lab. As recently as this weekend, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, despite saying there was no reason to disbelieve the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that the virus was neither manmade nor genetically modified, claimed there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d connecting the virus to the WIV.\n\nBut the truth is almost certainly not that salacious. Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine, said this dynamic is familiar. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s an outbreak, people say, oh, there\u2019s a lab close by.\u201d He should know: In 2014, during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, conspiracy theorists alleged his team\u2019s lab in Sierra Leone, not far from the origin of the outbreak, was a George Soros-funded bioweapons site.\n\nAccording to a growing body of research, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is almost certainly a naturally occurring virus that initially circulated in bats then spilled into humans. But that hasn\u2019t stopped some from trying to find a more sinister origin. \u201cIt seems like such an extreme event that people are looking for an extraordinary explanation for it,\u201d said Stephen Goldstein, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Utah who studies coronaviruses. No single piece of evidence has yet confirmed the virus\u2019 origin. But according to scientists, the evidence that does exist paints a consistent picture of a wild virus, not one that sprang from a lab.\n\nWhy do scientists think it wasn\u2019t genetically engineered?\n\nTo genetically engineer a new virus, scientists can combine pieces of viruses they\u2019ve seen before. In the case of a genetically engineered coronavirus that was designed to infect humans, the bulk of its genetic material \u2014 its \u201cbackbone\u201d \u2014 would come from SARS or a close relative, while the tools it used to infect cells would be grafted on. But the backbone doesn\u2019t look like any disease-causing virus, and other key parts of the virus are new to science.\n\nIn SARS-CoV-2\u2019s case, scientists thought they knew how to optimize SARS to infect human hosts. Coronaviruses enter host cells using protein \u201cspikes\u201d that cover their outer surface. At the tip of each spike is a cluster of amino acids that can bind to a certain receptor on a host cell, like a pick designed to open a particular cellular lock. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the spike binds to human ACE2 receptors, which coat lung cells.\n\nThe original SARS coronavirus targeted the same receptors, and after the 2002 SARS epidemic, experiments tinkered with its spike to determine the structure of an \u201coptimized\u201d version of the SARS lock pick. Many factors influence the success of a virus, but its binding ability is thought to be important, so \u201cif you were going to make a new virus, and make it even more infectious than SARS,\u201d said Goldstein, you would give it that optimized tip.\n\nBut, Garry said, the tip of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is unlike anything scientists have seen before, sharing only a single key amino acid with SARS. Modeling suggests that it shouldn\u2019t be able to bind to human lungs well, but the new configuration is about as effective as the optimized SARS.\n\nHow SARS-CoV-2 acquired this unusual tip is still a mystery. But blaming it on genetic engineering overstates the abilities of scientists, Garry said. Guessing that these particular amino acids can bind to ACE2 so effectively is nearly impossible\u2014 there are 20 common types of amino acids, and tens of millions of ways to arrange them into a binding tip. It would be like if you looked out over the proverbial infinite monkeys with their infinite typewriters, guessed that a specific macaque would type out King Lear, and then picked the right animal.\n\n\u201cNobody has that kind of insight into how the viruses evolve or cause disease,\u201d said Garry. \u201cYou could randomly try to make changes, but we\u2019re talking about thousands of years of trying pathogens out. I\u2019ve been really lucky to know a lot of talented virologists, and they\u2019re not clever enough to come up with a virus that\u2019s quite this good at spreading.\u201d\n\nWhat if it was in a petri dish and got out?\n\nAnother theory suggests a researcher at the WIV studying a precursor to SARS-CoV-2 was accidentally infected.\n\nBut the researchers I spoke to threw cold water on that. \u201cI think it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask these questions and examine all sources of the outbreak,\u201d said Gregory Koblentz, a professor at George Mason University who studies biosecurity. \u201cBut based on what we know of the biology of the virus, a natural source of the outbreak is the most likely explanation.\u201d\n\nThe virus\u2019s spike has a hinge-like structure, allowing the spike to change shape as the virus enters the host cell. Like the spike tip, the hinge on SARS-CoV-2 is markedly different from anything seen in its close relatives. New research suggests that the hinge loses its unique characteristics when cultured in a lab, said Garry. The spike also appears to be able to shield itself from antibodies\u2014another hint that it evolved in the presence of host immune systems.\n\nMost importantly, there\u2019s no smoking gun connecting the lab to an ancestor of the virus. There\u2019s \u201cno bat virus that\u2019s close enough to be the progenitor,\u201d said Garry. The closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2 is a cousin that diverged decades ago in bats.\n\nAnd while critics suggest that the WIV might have concealed the ancestral virus, 27 scientists who have collaborated with the WIV, including former U.S. officials, rejected the idea in a letter to The Lancet.\n\nKoblentz agrees there\u2019s not much evidence to suggest a cover-up. \u201cIf the Chinese government suspected that the outbreak was the result of a biosafety breach in Wuhan, I would have expected them to come down very hard on that lab, not letting them talk to foreigners,\u201d he said. But in March, a lead researcher at the WIV talked to Scientific American about her search for the ancestral strain.\n\nThe WIV has released sequences of bat coronavirus in the months since the epidemic started, giving other scientists insight into the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. Several of the early virus genome sequences in an open-source international database were submitted by the WIV, which allowed other countries to begin developing diagnostic tools. That willingness to release data, Koblentz said, could be evidence that weights \u201cthe scale towards [the WIV] being transparent and cooperative.\u201d\n\nThen how\u2019d it get here at all?\n\nThere\u2019s a simpler, if less flashy, explanation for the emergence of a new SARS. A study, published in 2018, of four rural villages in Yunnan province located near caves containing bats known to carry coronaviruses found that 2.7 percent of those surveyed had antibodies for close relatives of SARS. Thousands, if not millions, of people are exposed to wild coronaviruses every year.

The reports of biosafety issues, she said, are \u201clike having the health inspector come to your restaurant. It could just be, \u2018Oh, you need to keep your chemical showers better stocked.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t suggest, however, that there are tremendous problems.\u201d\n\nAnd Garry reiterated that it\u2019s incredibly unlikely SARS-CoV-2 is the result of a \u201cbad\u201d roll of the dice at the WIV. \u201cAll the natural exposures dwarf the possibility that it was some lab guy that was out catching bats and infected himself. That\u2019s one little thing among millions of encounters.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to totally rule out a lab accident, Rasmussen said, but she worries that unilateral, politically charged investigations will permanently damage international scientific collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe live in a global world,\u201d said Rasmussen. \u201cIt would hurt us tremendously if we were to stop collaborating with Chinese scientists.\u201d The next pandemic is unlikely to come from a lab, just as Ebola, SARS, Zika and avian flu did not, she said.

Social isolation, for example, is one of the most common tactics used by abusers to distance survivors from their support networks, and now physical isolation is government-sanctioned. Unemployment claims are hitting historic highs, as are levels of economic anxiety; both of these circumstances are linked to a higher incidence of domestic violence. Firearm ownership is tied to a greater chance of domestic homicide, and gun sales in the U.S. rocketed in March, with reports that many of those sales were to first-time gun buyers. National hotlines even have to devise strategies to combat abusers\u2019 weaponizing COVID-19 itself to terrorize survivors \u2014 e.g., threatening to infect someone with COVID-19 or hiding cleaning supplies so the survivor cannot access them.\n\nThe relationship between these factors and domestic violence is well researched and well documented, as many other articles have discussed. But tracking the pandemic\u2019s actual effects on domestic violence is nearly impossible. Many people who experience abuse don\u2019t report it through official channels. Stigma and fear of retribution are just a few of the reasons someone wouldn\u2019t contact the police. Because of that, we don\u2019t have good data showing domestic violence incidence in normal times, let alone now. In fact, we\u2019re getting conflicting signals at the moment \u2014 while the National Domestic Violence Hotline continued to see its average of 1,800 to 2,000 contacts a day through March and April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Friday that reports of domestic violence rose in the state during that same time.\n\nSo while we have solid, empirically derived reasons to believe that COVID-19 might increase the rate of domestic violence across the country, we don\u2019t have the numbers to back that claim. That can make the issue feel less real to the public and to policymakers, even though, due to the impact of COVID-19, the increase in intimate partner violence (IPV) \u2014 i.e., physical, psychological or sexual harm in an intimate relationship \u2014 may be significant.\n\nHow significant? There\u2019s no perfect case study to draw from, but we can make some reasonable conclusions by looking at research on IPV and past disasters with some similarities to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nEconomic anxiety and joblessness\n\nEconomic hardship, employment instability, unemployment and perceptions of economic strain have all been linked to IPV, according to Jennifer Copp, a professor at Florida State University\u2019s College of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Domestic violence is about power and control, and when your job, finances and livelihood are all up in the air, abuse becomes a place where people seek to regain that sense of control.\n\nIndeed, a 2001 research report from the National Institute of Justice found that rates of violence in couples experiencing high levels of financial stress were 3 1/2 times the rates in couples with low levels of stress \u2014 rising to 9.5 percent from 2.7 percent. According to a working paper by the Center for Global Development, the effects of unemployment on IPV vary across populations due to cultural differences, but in the U.S., the NIJ found in 2009 that periods of unemployment by a man in a heterosexual relationship are correlated with significantly elevated rates of abuse. That paper didn\u2019t show a causal link but found that couples in which the man was employed had a 4.7 percent prevalence of abuse, while that figure was 7.5 percent for couples in which the man experienced one period of unemployment and 12.3 percent for couples in which the man experienced two or more periods of unemployment.\n\nEconomically, the most recent circumstances analogous to the current pandemic may be those caused by the Great Recession, when the overall unemployment rate doubled from 5 percent in December 2007 to 10 percent in October 2009 and the net worth of households and nonprofits fell over 20 percent, a loss of some $14 trillion, in a year and a half. A 2016 study published in \u201cDemography\u201d on economic indicators and IPV during the Great Recession found that an increase in the unemployment rate was correlated with a small but significant change in IPV \u2014 a 50 percent increase in the unemployment rate over the prior 12-month period, for example, was associated with a 10 to 12 percent increase in the prevalence of physically violent or controlling behavior in intimate relationships.\n\nOf course, a correlation between economic hardship and IPV may be due to other factors that are linked to greater hardship or job loss and IPV \u2014 such as mental illness, stress or substance abuse. Establishing a causal relationship is much more difficult since economic hardship typically goes hand in hand with many other variables. Yet coupled with what we know about the interplay of economic precarity and domestic violence, the economic fallout of COVID-19 presents perhaps one of the greatest risks in terms of increasing abuse.\n\nNatural disasters\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult to draw comparisons between behavior after natural disasters and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, though, women have a much more precarious social and economic standing than men, and that vulnerability only increases during a disaster. Normal resources and social support that usually curb abuse can disappear entirely depending on the type of disaster \u2014 hotlines, access to legal help and shelter availability can all be disrupted. On top of that, IPV increases in the aftermath of disasters, but many factors are at play that don\u2019t apply as much to COVID-19 \u2014 most notably displacement, which is not yet a major effect of the pandemic.\n\nWhile research has shown that economic downturns are accompanied by physical, mental and emotional violence, the intersection of gender-based violence and disasters is only a recent area of focus. It\u2019s unclear whether increased violence is a simple matter of proximity or of stress or some other unknown variable.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth looking at some examples that may hold lessons for dealing with the current pandemic, as long as we keep in mind that the circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis are quite different. In 2011, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch, New Zealand, causing 185 deaths and thousands of injuries in addition to severe structural damage. Two weeks after the earthquake, area police said that reports of domestic violence had risen by a fifth. Afterward, police cited business closures as a reason why more people were drinking at home, aggravating the risk of domestic violence. Sexual violence rose after Hurricane Katrina, as many people were forced into temporary shelters. In the first six months after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, nearly 40 percent of sexual assaults were committed by strangers (versus the 19.5 percent committed by strangers in all reported cases of sexual assault in the U.S.); 31 percent of these assaults took place in shelters or evacuation sites. For people whose lives were highly disrupted by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, there was a nearly threefold increase in the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence afterward compared with people who experienced no disruption.\n\nOne of the most striking findings to come out of research on domestic violence in the wake of a natural disaster is that, separate from the rate of abuse changing, the severity of abuse can increase as well. In the aforementioned study of sexual assaults after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, researchers found that in the early aftermath of the disaster, \u201crapes appeared to be more brutal, often involving multiple offenders,\u201d and then returned to a more typical pattern a year later. After the 1997 Red River Valley flood, which displaced over 50,000 people in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and damaged nearly all homes in the area, referrals to domestic violence shelters from emergency rooms increased, possibly pointing to a rise in severity of physical abuse. Even now, Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said that survivors contacting them have seen an escalation in abuse tactics \u2014 including one person who said her partner pulled out a gun to prevent her from leaving the house, something that had never happened before.\n\nIn some ways at least, the COVID-19 pandemic is less problematic regarding IPV than other disasters: Most hotlines are still operational, and while shelter availability varies depending on locale, there hasn\u2019t been a natural event that wipes out the structures. Many domestic violence services are still operating and are able to offer support, although survivors may be less willing to go to one for fear of catching COVID-19. Nathaniel Fields, CEO of Urban Resource Institute in New York, an organization that provides resources and shelter for survivors of domestic violence, said that their priority right now is communication \u2014 when everyone, including your friends, neighbors and the government, is telling you to stay home, it can be hard to leave an abusive situation. Survivors find themselves doing the mental calculus of whether it\u2019s safer to stay home with the devil you know or risk the COVID-19 you don\u2019t.\n\nBut those silver linings aside, the COVID-19 pandemic is still likely meaningfully increasing the rate of domestic violence. Past downturns and disasters doubled or even tripled those rates. Those were each unique circumstances, making it hard to say if something similar will happen now. Indeed, Claire Renzetti, a professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky, didn\u2019t offer any speculation as to the scale of an increase. But she said that knowing what we know from previous experiences that haven\u2019t been as bad as this one, our current economic climate will likely increase IPV.\n\nMoreover, in normal times, domestic violence doesn\u2019t affect all populations equally, and these inequities are likely to be exacerbated during the pandemic. Some studies have found that low-income, black and Hispanic populations are more likely to experience IPV than white populations or those with post-secondary education. Those are the same groups bearing a disproportionate share of the direct health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t have the data to show much of this for years, if ever. Data collection during disasters suffers from logistical difficulties, and quantitative insights on domestic violence are chronically underreported. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\n\nLaura Bronner contributed research.\n\nHelp is available.

On Tuesday, the number of Americans who have tested positive for COVID-19 passed 1 million, and on Wednesday, deaths attributed to the disease \u2014 which are probably underestimated \u2014 rose to more than 60,000.\n\nAs the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths continue to grow, we checked back in with a survey of infectious-disease researchers from institutions around the U.S. to help us understand where we might be headed.\n\nFor the week ending April 25, 13,788 deaths were attributed to the coronavirus. In this week\u2019s survey, which was conducted on April 27 and 28, a plurality of experts predicted that weekly death totals would not fall below 5,000 until after June 20. The experts also forecast that between 1 million and 1.15 million total confirmed cases of COVID-19 will be reported on May 3.\n\nFor some questions in the survey \u2014 organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts Amherst \u2014 respondents are asked to provide their best estimate, as well as a best-case and worst-case possibility. Structuring the survey in this way lets the organizers generate probabilistic consensus forecasts, a tool that can answer questions about how likely various scenarios are.\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts had to say this week.\n\nHow many confirmed cases will be reported by May 3?\n\nThe experts have been asked this question in the past, and actual case numbers have fallen within their forecasted ranges. This time, they were given a set of five bins of predefined total confirmed cases and were asked to assign a probability to each. For the week ending May 3, the expert consensus is that between 1.1 and 1.15 million total confirmed cases will be reported by The COVID Tracking Project.\n\nAs has been true throughout the crisis, however, there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the predicted confirmed case count. The consensus forecast says that the chance (about 18 percent) that confirmed cases will be between 1.05 and 1.1 million is the same as the chance it will be above 1.2 million.\n\nWhen will new reported deaths per week drop below 5,000?\n\nIn the past two weeks, deaths attributed to the coronavirus have hovered above 13,700 (13,708 and 13,788). A drop to 5,000 weekly deaths would represent a decline of 64 percent \u2014 a substantial decrease. But experts are pessimistic that such a drop will happen in the near future. The expert consensus gives a nearly 40 percent chance of the U.S. hitting the 5,000-death weekly plateau by June 6 and a probability of just over 60 percent of it occurring some time after then.\n\nWhat will happen in Georgia?\n\nOn April 23, Georgia partially reopened for business, and stay-at-home restrictions have continued to be lifted across the state. The seven-day moving average for newly confirmed cases in the Peach State stood at just over 700 per day on April 20. Experts were asked to predict the new daily case average for the week ending on May 16 under the current open regime, along with the daily case average had Georgia not relaxed its stay-at-home orders.\n\nThe consensus forecast of 1,044 new confirmed cases per day in two weeks suggests that Georgia will see a substantial worsening of the virus\u2019s spread as a result of reopening. The daily number of new confirmed cases is forecast to be somewhere between 579 and 2,292, with six experts indicating that an increase to 2,000 or more new cases a day is plausible.\n\nExperts believe that the spread of COVID-19 could have been reduced had Georgia not relaxed its stay-at-home order. Under this scenario, experts predicted that Georgia would have seen only 487 new cases per day for the week ending on May 16, a reduction of more than 50 percent in new daily cases compared with the estimates in the open regime.\n\nThere was also less uncertainty among experts in their predictions for Georgia\u2019s new daily cases in the world where Georgia did not relax stay-at-home orders. Experts would have expected between 273 and 1,156 new cases per day, representing a spread half as large as the one for the new-case forecast without the stay-at-home orders.\n\nAs Americans slowly prepare to go back to work, the experts\u2019 forecast helps quantify the increased risk Georgia and other states have incurred by beginning to restart their economies in the midst of a still-uncontrolled pandemic.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The US is starting to reopen.

But experts don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing the gap. Is it biological, some quirk of cells and hormones? Is it the result of gendered behaviors that have more to do with sociology than sex chromosomes? Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s going on, because experts say men\u2019s risk level depends on what risks (and which men) you\u2019re talking about.\n\nWhat we know\n\nWhile men account for the majority of COVID-19 cases in some countries but a minority of cases in others, they consistently make up the majority of deaths. Out of 35 countries that have reported their COVID deaths in ways that break out victims by sex, 33 had a male-female death ratio greater than 1, meaning men who were confirmed to have the disease were more likely to die than women who were confirmed to have it, according to data compiled by Global Health 50/50, a independent health equity research organization based at University College London. \u201cSo far, the mortality disadvantage for men is quite large,\u201d said Jennifer Dowd, a professor of demography and population health at the University of Oxford.\n\nMen are more likely than women to die of COVID-19 Share of COVID-19 patients who died, by gender Deaths among confirmed cases Country male female ratio Dominican Republic 6.5% 2.1% 3.0 Thailand 2.5 0.9 2.7 Greece 7.8 3.1 2.5 Romania 7.9 3.5 2.3 The Netherlands 18.1 8.1 2.2 Italy 17.1 9.3 1.8 Belgium 15.3 8.6 1.8 Northern Ireland 10.4 5.6 1.8 Spain 10.2 5.8 1.8 Ecuador 6.9 3.9 1.8 Denmark 6.6 3.6 1.8 Argentina 6.3 3.5 1.8 Philippines 8.2 4.9 1.7 China 4.7 2.8 1.7 Sweden 15.1 9.4 1.6 Mexico 10.9 6.9 1.6 Switzerland 6.1 3.7 1.6 Ukraine 3.2 2.0 1.6 South Korea 2.9 1.8 1.6 Indonesia 9.3 6.4 1.5 Republic of Ireland 5.8 3.7 1.5 Colombia 5.4 3.5 1.5 Peru 3.1 2.1 1.5 South Africa 1.7 1.1 1.5 Australia 1.5 1.0 1.5 Portugal 4.7 3.3 1.4 Germany 4.5 3.2 1.4 Canada 4.5 3.6 1.3 Austria 4.1 3.1 1.3 Norway 2.9 2.3 1.3 Finland 3.3 2.8 1.2 Luxembourg 2.6 2.1 1.2 Iran 5.9 5.4 1.1 India 2.6 3.1 0.9 Pakistan 2.0 2.8 0.7 Numbers in this table come from different dates, depending on the country and how frequently it updates its publicly available data. Most of the data is dated to April 26-29, though a few countries\u2019 numbers are from earlier in April. China\u2019s data is from Feb. 28 and Iran\u2019s is from March 17. Source: Global Health 50/50\n\nThis dynamic isn\u2019t new to medicine. \u201cWomen have stronger adaptive immune responses and die less of infectious disease their entire lives, starting from infant mortality,\u201d Dowd said. In general, women\u2019s bodies kick out bacterial and viral invaders faster than men\u2019s do, and vaccines work better for women than for men.\n\nTo see why, look to hormones and genetics, said Sabra Klein, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University. Sex hormones appear to play a role determining how well human bodies can fight off disease. In general, estrogens amp up the immune system, while androgens (like testosterone) and progesterone suppress it. Hormones have to interact with cells to do their jobs, Klein said, so cells have a \u201clock\u201d and hormones have the \u201ckey\u201d to get in. And, turns out, every immune cell in your body has these kinds of lock-and-key receptors.\n\nSex chromosomes also play a role. The X chromosome, for example, has 60 genes associated with immune function. Most biological males are born with one X chromosome, but those immune-boosting genes tend to be expressed more frequently in women, who generally have two X chromosomes, Klein said.\n\nBut if you\u2019re tempted to think those sex differences boil down to \u201cmen are more likely to die from infectious disease,\u201d Klein cautioned that the generalization is not true across the board. Sex differentiation in influenza has been pretty well studied, she told me, and, in that case, women\u2019s more aggressive immune systems don\u2019t give us an advantage. Having too much of an inflammatory immune response to the flu can actually increase your risk of complications \u2014 including acute respiratory distress syndrome, when the lungs\u2019 tiny air sacs, called alveoli, are damaged and fill with fluid. \u201cReproductive-age women do worse, not better,\u201d Klein said.\n\nWhat we know we don\u2019t know\n\nBut while researchers know a decent amount about sex differences in influenza, the novel coronavirus is, yes, novel. Any research on it is a work in progress, proceeding without full data. That starts with basic documentation.\n\nOn April 28th, the United States had reported 57,318 deaths from the novel coronavirus, but only 31,586 of those deaths had been reported in ways that allowed Global Health 50/50 to break them down by sex. None of the researchers I spoke with knew why that data isn\u2019t getting reported. But without it, they\u2019re left to a lot of guesswork and speculation. It\u2019s safe to assume that deaths in the U.S. are probably following the patterns seen in many other countries \u2014 but we don\u2019t know for sure that that\u2019s true.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that the variations in how this virus affects people probably isn\u2019t just about what\u2019s in their chromosomes or hormones. It\u2019s also about sociological gender \u2014 the attitudes, stereotypes and norms that shape the ways people behave and the choices they make.\n\nFor example, a 2016 meta-analysis showed that women are about 50 percent more likely than men to start using non-pharmaceutical protective behaviors during a pandemic \u2014 things like wearing face masks or avoiding public transit. Men, meanwhile, were about 12 percent more likely than women to sign up for vaccines, take antiviral medication, or use other pharmaceutical interventions. Those differences in behavior aren\u2019t determined by biology, but they could help create variations in how a virus affects men and women.\n\nRosemary Morgan, a scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies how gender and sex interact with public health, thinks these kinds of effects are happening with COVID-19. But how and to what extent \u2014 that\u2019s unknown. It also probably differs from country to country, thanks to the way gender norms also aren\u2019t consistent everywhere you go.\n\nCase in point: When data on sex disparities in COVID-19 deaths first began to come in from China, it wasn\u2019t clear that the differences in death rates there would mean other counties were going to experience the same thing. That\u2019s because China has particularly gendered smoking habits, Dowd told me. In a 2010 study, 54 percent of Chinese men surveyed were current smokers. In contrast, the same study found that less than 3 percent of Chinese women currently smoked. Although sex differences in COVID-19 death rates have cropped up again in other countries, it\u2019s likely that this gender disparity in smoking plays a role in why 64 percent of China\u2019s COVID-19 deaths have been among men even though men account for right around half of China\u2019s confirmed cases.\n\nGender norms may also influence the niches where women are getting the disease more than men, despite men\u2019s higher death rates. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at the characteristics of health care workers who have contracted COVID-19, it found that 73 percent were women. Why are female health care workers getting infected at much higher rates? Part of it likely has to do with their higher odds of exposure.\n\nNurses\u2019 jobs put them in close physical contact with patients who have COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, and more than 70 percent of nurses are women. Meanwhile, the personal protective equipment meant to help keep medical workers safe often isn\u2019t designed with women in mind. Gloves can be too large.

That curve sure seems like it\u2019s bending! Or, that new case number seems lower than yesterday\u2019s!\n\nBut it\u2019s not that easy. Each chart you see reflects a host of decisions \u2014 which data to chart, which source to use, how to compare countries or states, how to display the data \u2014 that can drastically change what you see and what you can safely take away from the chart. To truly understand whether a place has reached the peak of its infection curve, you need to be a savvy reader of the charts and the underlying data. And, ideally, you need to look at more than one chart.\n\nSo what should you keep in mind when you\u2019re trying to interpret all these data visualizations?\n\nWhat is the chart showing?\n\nBefore you can know whether the chart is showing you a peak, you need to know what data it\u2019s showing you in the first place. Are you looking at total confirmed cases? Total hospitalizations? Total deaths? Or is the chart showing you day-by-day counts? Each of these numbers provide information \u2014 but each is incomplete. And they\u2019re not interchangeable.\n\nConfirmed cases\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to tell whether someplace has hit a peak using a chart of confirmed cases. Obviously, we\u2019d like to see the number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus decline. But anytime you see something tracking the number of cases, remember how hugely dependent it is on the number of tests being done. Anyplace that doesn\u2019t test for the coronavirus is not going to find cases. That\u2019s especially true in the U.S., where the number of tests done is reportedly minuscule relative to how many people report symptoms.\n\n\u201cWhen we see a plateau, it may just be because we\u2019ve maxed out our testing capacity rather than a true flattening of incident cases,\u201d said Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University. In other words, a flatter curve might just mean that the number of tests is failing to keep up with the number of infections. And as some states look to resume certain economic activities, they may have an incentive to keep testing levels low so the number of cases doesn\u2019t appear to increase.\n\nSo let\u2019s change our understanding of these kinds of charts off the bat: These aren\u2019t visualizations of the number of cases, they\u2019re visualizations of the number of confirmed cases, a number that, in most countries, drastically underestimates the true number of people who are sick.\n\nEven if testing was sufficient, the tests themselves still need to be accurate. There are reports that some tests might have shockingly high rates of false negatives \u2014 that is, people who have the disease but get a negative test result at least some of the time.\n\nEven if all cases were somehow measured, there would still be a lag between when someone is infected and when they get tested. It takes time to develop symptoms (the incubation period), have those symptoms get bad enough to send someone to the doctor for a test, and for the test to come back. While the lag likely differs by person, the numbers on a chart of confirmed cases are (even in the best case) quite out of date.\n\nThis lag is also one reason why charts showing the daily number of new cases can be somewhat misleading. What looks like a change happening that day might actually be reflecting a change that started a week or two ago. And lots of funky things can happen as data is collected and reported that can artificially depress or inflate a day\u2019s tally.\n\nAll of that could be dealt with \u2014 if all those factors stayed constant. That is, if people were generally getting tested at the same point in the course of their illness \u2026 and how health care professionals administered the tests wasn\u2019t changing \u2026 and the tests themselves weren\u2019t changing \u2026 and the delay in reporting results wasn\u2019t changing \u2026 then the trends in confirmed cases would still be informative about the virus\u2019s spread, even though the number of confirmed cases wouldn\u2019t directly reflect the number of infections. We\u2019re just looking for a change in the trend line on the chart, after all.\n\nBut the problem is that we don\u2019t know if any of that is staying constant. So it\u2019s very difficult to glean a useful signal from a metric as noisy as confirmed case counts.\n\nDeaths\n\nSo counting cases is fraught. What about just counting deaths? Surely that\u2019s less questionable, since every place already tracks how many people die there, so those numbers should be more reliable. This might be true \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to be sure.\n\nTo track coronavirus deaths, you still need to confirm that a person who died had COVID-19 \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear that that\u2019s being done. Some people aren\u2019t being tested before or after they die, and COVID-19 may not appear on someone\u2019s death certificate even if it seemed likely they had the disease. For people who don\u2019t die at a hospital, establishing the cause of death might be even more challenging, especially if coronavirus tests are scarce and being reserved for the living. And some countries have changed how they count deaths outside of hospitals as this pandemic has ground on, making it harder to interpret the trend over time.\n\nHospitals and governments also have an incentive to underreport COVID-19 deaths, since fatalities can make those institutions look bad. For instance, the CIA doesn\u2019t believe the Chinese government\u2019s official infection and death tallies.\n\nHospitalizations\n\nAre hospitalizations the most accurate type of data? New York City, for example, has started releasing the number of people who have been hospitalized. Assuming that this data is collected correctly, we might think that this is the chart that would provide us the most reliable trend. If it peaked, then that would seem to be a good indicator that the infection has as well, even if most people with COVID-19 are never hospitalized.\n\nBut what happens if the criteria for hospitalization change as the outbreak progresses? If hospitals increase the threshold for admission as they run out of beds \u2014 if, for example, any shortness of breath was enough to get someone admitted in the early days of the pandemic, but health care workers start turning away those patients as resources get scarcer \u2014 then a chart that shows a plateau in hospitalizations could be a sign of a system approaching capacity rather than (or in addition to!) a change in the number of infections. (The same is true, for instance, if people are increasingly told to avoid hospitals unless absolutely necessary.)\n\nHow is the data being displayed?\n\nThe kind of chart you\u2019re looking at also matters. Peaks are even harder to see if charts use a logarithmic scale, which many COVID-19 visualizations do. Using a log scale means that the chart\u2019s vertical axis doesn\u2019t increase the way you might expect, with the distance between 0 and 1,000 being the same size as the distance between 10,000 and 11,000. Instead, the number multiplies for each equally sized space on the y-axis \u2014 that is, if one space on the y-axis goes from 100 to 1,000, the next space of the same size will go from 1,000 to 10,000, and the one after that will go from 10,000 and 100,000, but the size of the gap between each set of those numbers stays the same even as the numbers jump up by bigger and bigger margins. This kind of trick has several advantages, including that it lets you compare a location\u2019s curve when it has a relatively low number of cases and when it has a high number of cases. (If you have a linear scale, in contrast, showing the top end of the scale necessarily means that small values will be very hard to see.)\n\nOn the other hand, using a log scale also means that once you get to higher values, small-looking fluctuations in case counts can reflect pretty big differences in raw numbers. This makes it even harder to visually draw inferences about peaks from charts.\n\nOf course, all of these concerns are even more serious when the chart shows data from more than one place, regardless of whether what\u2019s being compared are different countries or different states. These kinds of charts have all the same issues as the ones tracking numbers in a single place, but that set of problems is multiplied by the number of places on the chart.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nLet\u2019s say that, according to one of the metrics above, the curve does seem to be bending downward. What does that mean? Well, first, you might want to look at the other metrics too. If all three measures \u2014 confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths \u2014 are going down, and the total number of tests administered hasn\u2019t dropped, that makes it more likely that there really is good news. And a better metric \u2014 though still one with issues \u2014 is the share of positive tests out of all tests administered, which tries to account for testing in some way (though it doesn\u2019t address whether who is being tested is changing). (Though if the number of cases is still growing, even if it\u2019s at a lower rate, that would continue to increase the strain on an already burdened health care system.)\n\nAnd as Joshua Epstein, the director of the New York University Agent-Based Modeling Lab, said in an online seminar: With any infectious disease, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of transmission after the peak.\u201d Reaching the peak on a chart doesn\u2019t mean you can go outside again \u2014 it means that the outbreak is at its worst. Even if it is getting better, you might still need to be extremely careful for a while.\n\nAnd even if you are fully convinced that things are truly improving \u2014 new cases are going down, hospitals are nowhere near overcrowding, and the sick are getting better \u2014 what do you do when restrictions ease? Germany, which tested very high rates of people early on in the outbreak and had relatively low case numbers and deaths, has come up with a plan for gradual reopening. But if the peak has been successfully averted and relatively few people have had the disease, that might mean that a second, potentially larger peak is in the offing. Even after the infection peaks, the danger may be on the rise.\n\nCORRECTION (April 23, 2020, 5:41 p.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated how the y-axis on a logarithmic chart would look. Instead of saying that the distance between 0 and 1,000 would be the same as the distance between 1,000 and 10,000, it should have said that the distance between 100 and 1,000 would be the same as the distance between 1,000 and 10,000.", "author": ["Laura Bronner"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-are-some-young-healthy-people-getting-severe-covid-19/", "published": "2020-04-23T11:00:49", "title": "Why Are Some Young, Healthy People Getting Severe COVID-19?", "text": "Most young people who get COVID-19 get pretty nasty flu-like symptoms but fight off the infection on their own with bed rest and over-the-counter pain medication. Some, though, have a severe, even deadly, case. Why is it that someone who seems healthy and has no underlying conditions could be killed by this virus when so many of their peers pull through just fine? Let\u2019s break down what we know and what research is needed to answer this COVID-19 mystery.\n\nWhat we know\n\nOur understanding of why some people get mild infections while others wind up hospitalized or killed by COVID-19 is still limited. In the U.S., 34 percent of confirmed COVID-19 cases are in patients under the age of 45, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from mid-March. Of patients known to be hospitalized, about 20 percent were under 45, and of those known to be admitted to the ICU, 12 percent were under 45. The CDC also reports that the case fatality rate is less than 1 percent for people age 20-54.\n\nBut there isn\u2019t much we know about why some young people are getting extremely sick and others aren\u2019t. We know that age is a risk factor \u2014 the case fatality rate for COVID-19 climbs steeply for patients over 60. This is true for a lot of infections and generally has to do with diminishing immune systems and underlying health conditions.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t help us figure out what\u2019s going on with these cases where young people get sick and it quickly turns serious. It\u2019s not as simple as pointing to underlying conditions. Many conditions, such as asthma, haven\u2019t been definitively confirmed as risk factors, though many doctors suspect they are.\n\n\u201cWe have guesses, but we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dr. David Smith, the head of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at the University of California San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to figure that out.\u201d\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know (and how we figure it out)\n\nSure, there\u2019s plenty scientists don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s what hypotheses are for. Researchers have already begun studies to uncover which factors contribute to a severe or deadly case.\n\nSome are looking into genetic differences. Our genes can affect the way our immune system responds to an infection, which could explain why some people fare worse than others. \u201cThe possibilities, unfortunately, are endless,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Laurent Casanova, an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and physician at Rockefeller University Hospital. \u201cBetween the first encounter with the virus and death, you can imagine that there are lots and lots of steps. At any of these steps, a defective immunity in any of the cells encountered by the virus can be responsible for severe disease and therefore death.\u201d\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight\n\nCasanova is leading a global study to try to identify what, if any, genetic mutations may cause otherwise healthy young people to have a more severe or deadly infection. The study will look for any shared genetic mutations among otherwise healthy patients under 50 who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to an ICU. From there, they can investigate those mutations further to determine whether they cause a susceptibility to severe COVID-19.\n\nAnother factor being investigated is the infectious dose, or the amount of virus a patient was exposed to when they first became ill. Could it affect how sick someone becomes, regardless of their age or health? This can be determined through epidemiological studies, where researchers compare groups of patients to learn more about how they first became infected and whether higher levels of viral exposure correspond to sicker patients. For example, Smith explained that researchers could track households where at least one member got COVID-19 and measure how much virus the patient is shedding, then observe how other members of the household fare. It can also be studied using animals in a lab to see how immune responses change at different levels of exposure.\n\nThere\u2019s also a chance that whether or not you have already been exposed to COVID-19 can determine how severe your infection is. With the dengue virus, for example, the first time someone is exposed to the virus, they often have only a mild infection, but if they encounter it a second time, it can become deadly. Researchers believe this is due to the antibodies the body creates after first exposure, which start to diminish over time. If they drop to a low enough level, they\u2019re not able to fight off the virus, but instead they inadvertently assist the virus in infecting cells. It\u2019s called antibody-dependent enhancement, and researchers are investigating whether past exposure to this or a similar coronavirus could worsen the symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nOther researchers are looking at whether the microbiome \u2014 the menagerie of bacteria, viruses and fungi that live in and on the human body \u2014 could be playing a role. Microbiomes differ from person to person and some microbes have been known to help or hinder an individual\u2019s ability to fight off infection.\n\nAll of these possibilities will require studies that use control groups to determine whether these variables are actually causing a more severe reaction or if their presence is just a coincidence. It might be true that a high proportion of COVID-19 patients drink coffee, for example, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean drinking coffee puts you at a higher risk of COVID-19. (And, god, can you imagine if it did?) The only way to know for sure is by running a trial and comparing a group with one set of factors to a group without those factors to see if there\u2019s a consistent difference between them.\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing crisis, one way to ethically do this (without purposely giving people a potentially deadly infection) is through a case control study, which looks retroactively at infections that have already played out.\n\n\u201cSo you have a case and a control and they look the same, except one progressed and one didn\u2019t,\u201d Smith, of UCSD, said. \u201cThen you sort of work your way backwards and say, \u2018What is really different between these two groups?\u2019 And you need lots of people [in the study] to get that figured out.\u201d\n\nAnother option is called a cohort study, where a sample of the population is enrolled and then followed over time to see who gets sick and how sick they get. Those who got seriously ill can then be compared to those who didn\u2019t get sick or had less severe infections to see what differences stand out.\n\nLuckily, many of the studies needed to determine why some young people get severe infections are already underway, and we could see preliminary results in a matter of months. But it may take years to fully understand why COVID-19 affects people differently.", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-one-high-risk-community-in-rural-south-carolina-is-bracing-for-covid-19/", "published": "2020-04-22T17:58:59", "title": "How One High-Risk Community In Rural South Carolina Is Bracing For COVID-19", "text": "How One High-Risk Community In Rural South Carolina Is Bracing For COVID-19 Hardeeville has one of the country\u2019s highest ratios of vulnerable residents to ICU beds.\n\nJust as some demographic groups are more at risk than others of getting seriously ill from the new coronavirus, some parts of the country are more vulnerable to being hit hard by this pandemic. In places with more sick people, more people over 65 and fewer hospital beds per person, the health care system could easily be swamped, leaving residents who need hospitalization in even greater danger.\n\nTo find the areas at the greatest risk of being overwhelmed by a COVID-19 outbreak, we analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a collection of surveys that ask U.S. residents about their health, which allowed us to estimate what percentage of residents in a region were at risk due to their age or underlying health conditions. We then used Kaiser Health News\u2019s data on the number of hospitals and intensive care unit beds in each U.S. county to find the ratio of at-risk residents to beds.\n\nBy that measure, one of the most vulnerable regions for which we have data is the Hilton Head Island metropolitan area, where about 63 percent of adults are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and there are approximately 3,900 high-risk individuals for every ICU bed.\n\nWhile the percentage of Hilton Head residents who are at risk is on the higher end of our data set, it\u2019s still notably lower than the 70 to 80 percent we saw in several other areas we analyzed. But those regions had more health care facilities to serve those at-risk residents, while the Hilton Head area has only three hospitals and 28 ICU beds.\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight\n\nTake Hardeeville, for example. It\u2019s a small city in the Hilton Head metropolitan area, and in many ways it\u2019s like any other rural area. Under normal circumstances, the city\u2019s residents would be looking forward to an Easter egg hunt, golf and pickleball tournaments, proms and graduations. But the people of Hardeeville are particularly vulnerable to the new coronavirus. In the last decade, the city has seen a population boom, and many of those new residents are retirees, according to Hardeeville Mayor Harry Williams. The city\u2019s large older population \u2014 the percentage of residents who\u2019ve hit retirement age is nearly twice as high as the national share of people over 65 \u2014 may be cause for concern, as Jasper County, where Hardeeville is located, has only one hospital and four ICU beds.\n\nWhile regular hospital beds can be converted to serve critically ill patients, it\u2019s not easy to do because ICU beds require more equipment and specialized room layouts. Despite the difficulties, Coastal Carolina Hospital, the only hospital in Jasper County, has added beds for seriously ill patients by turning its observation unit into an ICU patient treatment area, according to hospital CEO Joel Taylor. Other hospitals are adding beds in temporary spaces like tents and trailers.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just a lack of beds that can strain the health care system, noted David Wallace, a critical care doctor and professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Shortages of space, staff, medications and other vital resources are also a concern, and health systems in rural and poorer areas will be stretched the thinnest.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be parts of the country that don\u2019t even have the staffing even if you were able to ramp up your available resources, in terms of places to put these patients,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIf we were able to create more ICU beds and more ventilators and more [personal protective equipment], who\u2019s going to be staffing those areas?\u201d\n\nCoastal Carolina Hospital is cataloguing what skills workers already have and cross-training them to work in parts of the hospital outside their normal assignments. This gives the hospital more flexibility in staffing, allowing it to do more with a limited number of employees by switching people to cover areas facing staffing shortfalls.\n\nHardeeville\u2019s mayor is also worried about how easy it would be for the area to run out of other types of vital workers, like first responders. \u201cBeing in a rural area, we have a good staff, but it\u2019s not a staff that can afford to have a whole shift wiped out because one person got sick and passed it onto the entire shift,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big concern of ours because we don\u2019t have replacement numbers if our first responders get sick.\u201d\n\nWilliams said the city got a shipment of additional masks and other protective gear for its first responders a few weeks ago, just as supplies were running low. So far, the city hasn\u2019t run out, but it also doesn\u2019t have a stockpile that would last through a big surge of cases.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there have only been 15 COVID-19 cases and one death in Jasper County, according to South Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Environmental Control. COVID-19 data should always be taken with a grain of salt, though, since tests have been so hard to come by. The closest testing site to Hardeeville is a hospital in a neighboring county, about 35 minutes away. Coastal Carolina is working on being able to test patients on site, Taylor said.\n\nThe state is encouraging residents to practice social distancing. But of course, staying at home is easier for some people than others. Williams said that in the gated communities where older residents often live, \u201cAmazon is a way of life,\u201d but that\u2019s not the case for working families.\n\n\u201cDelivery services are not as effective as, let\u2019s say, New York City,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFor the working families that have to go to the grocery stores, go to Walmart for their everyday needs, those people need to go out. Those stores are open and they are taking precautions. The governor has limited the amount of people allowed in them, based on their square footage.\u201d\n\nBut even those who have to go out are doing their best to keep infection rates down, Williams said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s pitching in.\u201d\n\nBut more people may start leaving their homes soon. Shutting down businesses is having devastating effects on the economy, and the Hilton Head area is a popular vacation destination, so losing that influx of tourism dollars is an especially big blow for places like Hardeeville. South Carolina\u2019s governor announced Monday to allow public beaches and some retail stores to reopen. But experts say relaxing social distancing measures too soon and before testing is widely available might result in another influx of cases, overwhelming the health care system and leading to even more deaths.\n\nFind the full data set on GitHub to see if your area is included and how it compares with other areas.", "author": ["Likhitha Butchireddygari"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-a-shortage-of-sand-and-other-common-items-could-delay-a-coronavirus-vaccine/", "published": "2020-04-21T22:44:17", "title": "How A Shortage Of Sand (And Other Common Items) Could Delay A Coronavirus Vaccine", "text": "How A Shortage Of Sand (And Other Common Items) Could Delay A Coronavirus Vaccine\n\nAs laboratories across the globe scramble to make a COVID-19 vaccine, manufacturers face shortages of common ingredients and supplies.

We\u2019ll need both to safely emerge from the confines of social isolation, said Scott Becker, chief executive officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. The direct tests are critical for finding infected people, tracing who they have been in contact with and isolating them before they can pass the virus to others. The indirect (or \u201cserological\u201d) tests, administered across broad swaths of the population, can help public health experts understand how the virus spreads and how people build immunity to it.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight\n\nSo far, Americans have primarily been dealing with direct tests.

To ramp up our testing capacity quickly, a lot of that equipment has been called into service \u2014 a sort of scientific version of the evacuation of Dunkirk, with research and diagnostic labs across the country setting aside their regular work to take up the cause. \u201cEverybody has their homebrew test,\u201d said Dr. Davey Smith, a research virologist at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cAnybody who has a thermocycler has basically turned it into a testing platform.\u201d\n\nBut we still aren\u2019t able to test enough people fast enough. Ideally, Greninger said, we\u2019d have a single testing platform that would allow a medical worker to take a sample from a patient, put it directly into a machine with little hands-on time and quickly process thousands of tests over the course of a single day.\n\nWhen those features aren\u2019t all in one package, it essentially means that you need more people and more equipment \u2014 and both are in short supply. Researchers still don\u2019t have enough of the chemicals they need to run direct tests. For years, it was cheaper to manufacture those key ingredients overseas and keep just enough of the product on hand. Nobody had stockpiles. A global pandemic increased demand at the same time it decreased access to the supply, and while companies are now making the chemicals in the U.S., we\u2019ve still not caught up to the quantities needed, Smith said.\n\nAnd some of the best tests still have serious drawbacks, Greninger said. Take Cepheid\u2019s Xpert Xpress, a direct testing system that processes samples in little cartridges that pop into a specialized machine. \u201cA Cepheid is a fantastic instrument, but you can run one cartridge every 45 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a wall of Cepheids, you could potentially do 1,000 tests a day. But you have to own 100 of those little instruments.\u201d Another test that\u2019s gotten a lot of press, from Abbott Laboratories, takes 13 minutes to deliver negative results (it takes less time to process a positive sample \u2014 but most samples will be negative). However, it requires a lot of hands-on labor, he told me. And people, Greninger and Smith said, are in nearly as short of supply as chemicals.\n\nIf the number of direct tests has exploded, then the number of indirect tests is like a star going supernova. While only four have received an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, the agency says it has been notified by 98 test developers that they are offering tests for sale. That\u2019s significant because of the approach the FDA is taking to new indirect tests. Usually, companies would have to go through years of research to prove, document and verify the quality and effectiveness of a new test before it could earn FDA approval. Now, though, the agency is allowing the entire approval process to be sidestepped, saying it won\u2019t object to any new test being used by the public so long as the developers tell the FDA about their test and don\u2019t try to make false claims about what it can do. If they want to get an EUA, the developers can voluntarily document how well their test works and send the data to the FDA \u2014 after the test is already in use.\n\nThese indirect tests are crucial, experts told me. They can turn up a false negative if you take them too soon, without giving your body enough time to build up antibodies. But they\u2019re the tool epidemiologists need in order to get a better handle on how many Americans are actually contracting this virus, and who has and hasn\u2019t built up some level of immunity.\n\nThat means dozens of tests \u2014 not including the four tests with an EUA \u2014 are being sold despite never having submitted data to the FDA to show how well they work (or even prove they do). They are being sold and used, but may not be useful. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff out there of dubious quality,\u201d Becker told me. The city of Laredo, Texas, spent $500,000 on serology tests it later determined to be \u201cunreliable and unusable.\u201d The same thing happened in the United Kingdom \u2014 only to the tune of $20 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the wild, wild west,\u201d Smith told me, and that\u2019s even before you get into the fact that few of these tests \u2014 whether serological or diagnostic \u2014 have been checked against each other to make sure there aren\u2019t big differences in the results they each turn up. Counties, states and individual hospital systems are all using different tests and testing platforms, Smith said, but we don\u2019t really know at this point if one swabbed sample would produce the same result in California as in South Carolina. \u201cI don\u2019t want to belabor this and say it was a mistake [to move so quickly]. It\u2019s not,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBetter to get tests out there even if some were marginally good. They were good enough for the moment. But now we need to figure out how we validate this.\u201d\n\nThat kind of cross-checking is going to be a big part of how we move forward. And so is simply getting more access to needed supplies. For example, one of the world\u2019s biggest suppliers of medical swabs was in Italy \u2014 which obviously threw a wrench in supply chains when the country was hit hard by the coronavirus. Now the FDA is relaxing rules on the types of swabs that can be used, opening up opportunities for U.S. manufacturers to design and produce new types. But at the same time, it\u2019s also relaxed the rules on how swab samples can be taken \u2014 steps that make the diagnostic tests less invasive for patients, but could result in a higher rate of false negatives.\n\nTrying to test more while also maintaining quality control is a hard balance to strike. But there are some ways to walk that line that are less fraught than others. Maybe one of the first things we need to do, Greninger said, is get everybody on the same page about testing criteria. Some laboratories are not reaching their testing capacity because the hospitals they serve are only allowing a narrow swath of people to get tested. Making better use of the tools we have would be a step in the right direction.\n\nUltimately, a lot of these problems are just about the learning curve for figuring out something totally new, Becker told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had to stand up lab capacity across our country and around the world at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had outbreaks and SARS and MERS, but that wasn\u2019t this. We\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/experts-think-the-u-s-covid-19-death-toll-will-hit-50000-by-the-end-of-april/", "published": "2020-04-17T15:14:36", "title": "Experts Think The U.S. COVID-19 Death Toll Will Hit 50,000 By The End Of April", "text": "Over the past week, the number of deaths thought to be caused by COVID-19 has nearly doubled, from about 16,000 to 30,000. New York City changed the way it counts its death toll on Tuesday to include people who did not receive a positive COVID-19 test but who were likely to have died from the virus. That increased the number of the city\u2019s coronavirus death estimate by 3,700 to more than 10,000.\n\nThe number of cases and fatalities continue to change rapidly, so to get a better understanding of where they\u2019re headed, we\u2019ve been following a weekly survey of infectious-disease researchers from institutions around the U.S.\n\nThis week\u2019s survey, conducted April 13 and 14, shows that the expert consensus is that reported deaths will increase to around 47,000 by May 1, although they think there could be as many as 82,000 by that time. The experts also think fatalities are most likely to peak in May, but they still see about a 1 in 3 chance that deaths won\u2019t peak until June or later. They also expect that between eight and 11 states will report more than 1,000 deaths by May 1.\n\nThe survey \u2014 organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst \u2014 asks experts to either assign a probability to an outcome or to give a most-likely, best-case and worst-case estimate. Structuring the survey in this way lets the organizers generate probabilistic consensus forecasts, a tool that can answer questions about how likely various scenarios are.\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts had to say this week.\n\nHow many deaths will be reported on May 1?\n\nExperts were asked to give the smallest, largest and most likely number of fatalities they thought will be reported by The COVID Tracking Project as of May 1, and all but two thought it most likely that there would be 50,000 or fewer deaths, although some of the worst-case ranges extended far beyond that.\n\nThe expert consensus is that the U.S. will have reported around 47,000 COVID-19 deaths by May 1, with a 90 percent chance of having between 32,000 and 82,000.\n\nThis is very close to the latest forecast from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which projects roughly 51,000 deaths by May 1, with an uncertainty range from about 28,000 to 112,000.\n\nWhich month will see the most COVID-19 deaths?\n\nFor five weeks, surveyed experts were asked what factors led to the difference between their best-case and worst-case estimates in longer-term death forecasts. The answers have had a common refrain: They can\u2019t perfectly predict what stay-at-home orders will be enacted, how long they will last, and how well people will follow those orders. That last issue became particularly salient this week as protesters in Michigan, Ohio and North Carolina organized in opposition to their state\u2019s stay-at-home orders.\n\nExperts think deaths are most likely to peak relatively soon, with a 65 percent chance that the highest number of fatalities will be reported in either April or May. But a later peak \u2014 perhaps because of relaxed social distancing measures \u2014 is still possible, with experts estimating a 35 percent chance that the peak will be in June or later.\n\nHow many states will have more than 1,000 COVID-19 deaths by May 1?\n\nAt the time the survey was conducted, three states \u2014 New York, New Jersey and Michigan \u2014 had reported more than 1,000 COVID-19 deaths. As of Thursday, Louisiana, Massachusetts and Illinois have also passed that threshold.\n\nThe experts were asked how many states will report more than 1,000 deaths by May 1. They estimated that the most likely number was between eight and 11 states, with a nearly 1 in 3 chance that at least 12 states would report that many deaths.\n\nIn this week\u2019s survey, the experts were asked to report the proportion of their responses that were based on forecasting models they were directly involved with building, as opposed to \u201cgeneral knowledge about disease dynamics.\u201d They said 44 percent of their responses were based on models they\u2019ve helped build, up from 32 percent in a similar question two weeks ago.\n\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model has revised its projected death counts downward, as it appears that social distancing measures have helped flatten the curve of the coronavirus. But given the uncertainty that remains in these experts\u2019 forecasts, it seems like they aren\u2019t convinced the curve won\u2019t start to rise again.", "author": ["Jay Boice"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-one-expert-is-still-making-covid-19-models-despite-the-uncertainty/", "published": "2020-04-17T12:36:28", "title": "Why One Expert Is Still Making COVID-19 Models, Despite The Uncertainty", "text": "For the past few months, we\u2019ve heard a lot about statistical models and their predictions of what might happen as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on. Their estimates have varied widely \u2014 in part because almost every piece of data that goes into the models is imperfect. But just what is an epidemic model, anyway, and how do they work? How do we know which ones to trust? At a time when lives depend on the accuracy of these models, it\u2019s more important than ever to understand their strengths and limitations.\n\nI am a university professor, a scientist, and an infectious disease modeler. I\u2019ve invented some COVID-19 models. My colleagues and I have spent years teaching doctoral students to derive new and better models. When I do, I emphasize that models are a tool for making our ideas clear.\n\nFor instance, take our struggle to understand how the novel coronavirus is transmitted. The basic hope of our mitigation efforts is that testing and isolation of contagious cases can limit the spread of COVID-19. We also need to worry about the contagiousness of an infection, how many superspreaders there are, and how long a person is infectious before they begin to show symptoms. But we\u2019re not quite sure about how all those variables interact. This is where models come in.\n\nInfectious disease modelers represent the process of transmission as a dynamical process, which is just a fancy way of saying that the variables change in response to each other. Exactly how modelers represent this process differs according to the tastes and talents of whoever\u2019s designing the model. Some modelers write down equations and think about the interaction between an infectious person and a susceptible person like two reagents in a chemical reaction. Other modelers think that approach simplifies things too much. It\u2019s better, they say, to write a computer program that represents all the people in a population, like characters in a computer game, and then let the game play out according to some algorithm to see what happens. In either case, the scientist has posed what we call a mechanistic model that is governed by certain rules.\n\nThere\u2019s a challenge with mechanistic models, however. To fully specify a mechanistic model, we have to give actual values to every single feature of the model. If a COVID-19 model factors in isolation and recovery \u2014 and it must or else every person who gets infected would go on to infect others for all eternity \u2014 then the modelers must specify the isolation rate and recovery rate, and also the transmission rate. Actually, they need a value for every single aspect of the world they decide to represent. (And they want to represent all the ones they think are important \u2014 there might be a lot of them.)\n\nWhere do we get these values from? There is no periodic table where we can look up the isolation and transmission rates of all infectious diseases. In fact, those isolation and transmission rates are almost certainly highly variable from one community to another because things differ so much between places. Think, for example, of health care infrastructure, the availability of tests, and the average number of individuals people come into contact with daily.\n\nThere is no single way that infectious disease modelers arrive at reliable (and sometimes unreliable) numbers for these values. Some of these things we can measure. For instance, we can measure the speed at which people isolate by asking people who are hospitalized when they first began to feel symptoms and when they were first isolated (hospitalized or quarantined). If the delay is five days on average, in some population or other, then the isolation rate for that population is \u2155.\n\nAnother way we can arrive at a number for an unknown quantity is by \u201cfitting\u201d our model. Let\u2019s imagine a super-simple model as an example, one with only two variables: the transmission rate and the recovery rate. When fitting a model we take some real-world data \u2014 say, the number of newly discovered cases in a population \u2014 and we tune those two unknown variables from one extreme to the other to find the intermediate value at which the model most looks like the actual, real-life data. In the case of the novel coronavirus, the data could be the number of cases, hospitalizations or deaths.\n\nOf course, to say something scientifically, we have to be precise about what we mean by \u201cmost looks like the actual, real-life data.\u201d We do this with yet another model, typically a statistical model, that calculates the probability of observing the data we actually have, given different assumptions. We say that those models for which our data are relatively probable have high likelihood, and there\u2019s a whole statistical framework for comparing the likelihoods of different models.\n\nPeople looking at models \u2014 and people using them to make policy decisions \u2014 should be asking additional questions too. For instance: How all-encompassing are the model\u2019s predictions? If the epidemic doesn\u2019t play out the way the model said it should, why is that? Does that mean the model was wrong? Is a wrong model a bad model? What is a prediction anyway? What is the nature of the relationship between the model and reality? (Being an infectious disease researcher can get existential in a hurry.)\n\nSo, even though models are for making ideas clear, the path to making one isn\u2019t always so clear. Yet for all their imprecisions, they\u2019re still better than nothing. Either we can use models, trying to stay cautious about how much they\u2019re really telling us, or we can rely on conjecture, gut reactions and expert opinion alone. Only the first path is a transparent one with a built-in mechanism for self-correction.", "author": ["John M.

Using a combination of social distancing, tight travel restrictions and contact tracing, the country has kept its death toll under 100 people and seems to be leveling off its new cases. It\u2019s even managed to avoid closing schools. But despite the relatively minor impact the novel coronavirus has had on life in Australia, medical workers are still running low on masks, gloves and gowns.\n\n\u201cSuddenly it feels like a house of cards,\u201d said Simon Quilty, senior staff specialist at Alice Springs Hospital in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite [run out of personal protective equipment], but we\u2019ve come very close to it. We don\u2019t even have the pandemic. If we do get a pandemic, we\u2019re fucked.\u201d\n\nAll around the world, whether hard-hit by the virus or not, countries are running low on crucial supplies. And while shortages are largely confined to disposable medical items for now \u2014 personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs, chemicals used for COVID-19 testing \u2014 experts say other shortages are likely. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is affecting the way we manufacture all sorts of products, and the way we get those products to where they\u2019re needed. People who study these supply chains have seen problems coming for years. Now they\u2019re scrambling to get ahead of the pandemic, before it ends up affecting even our ability to produce the vaccines we hope will stop the disease in its tracks.\n\n\u201cUp until a few weeks ago, I knew very little about the supply chain,\u201d said Megan Ranney, a professor of emergency medicine at Brown University. \u201cIt always just worked. But I\u2019ve learned a bunch, and it\u2019s more fragile than we ever thought possible.\u201d COVID-19 has forced her \u2014 and lots of other hospitalists around the country \u2014 to become supply chain experts on the fly.\n\nA supply chain is a fancy term to describe how products get made and moved all around the globe. It\u2019s a simple concept, but not a simple process. Supply chains aren\u2019t a conveyor belt \u2014 they\u2019re a ballet. And there are many, many ways this spectacular show can fall flat on its face. The production of a single item often involves multiple factories in several different countries and depends on speedy, reliable international shipping to get each piece to the right place at the right time \u2014 and then to the buyers exactly when they need it.\n\nIn fact, experts in both manufacturing and medicine have spent years warning of the risks a pandemic \u2014 or another major disaster \u2014 could cause to supply chains. In 2011, for instance, Quilty documented that the hospital where he worked at the time had less than a 30 days\u2019 supply of penicillin and many other crucial pharmaceutical drugs. A 2017 paper by scientists with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that PPE supplies had run into problems during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic, and warned that the system wasn\u2019t prepared to handle a sudden increase in demand. Multiple reports have been published on how avian flu pandemics could disrupt everything from computer manufacturing to the global food supply.\n\n\u201cPPE is the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Ranney said. She, and other experts, told me that right now, that\u2019s the main place we\u2019re seeing supply chains break down. But those same issues apply to damn near everything else we make and sell. The longer the pandemic goes on, the more products will be affected.\n\nThere are three big problems with the global supply chains, experts told me. First, the push toward lowest-cost production means a lot of cheap goods and cheap components of more valuable goods are made in places with low-cost labor. When those countries experience a pandemic outbreak \u2014 or when a pandemic interrupts transport from those countries \u2014 it creates a bottleneck.\n\nAround half the world\u2019s face masks came from China before the novel coronavirus pandemic began. The virus interrupted manufacturing there early on, Ranney said. Now, China can make masks again, but demand has jumped all over the world, and there are shipping delays. Several companies have told her to expect deliveries to take three or four weeks. In the meantime, she\u2019s been left to sort through sketchy, back-alley PPE dealers, some of whom produce low-quality masks that either fall apart or don\u2019t filter properly on testing. Other would-be suppliers have turned out to be basically the high-stakes equivalent of one of those \u201cyou\u2019ve inherited $3,000,000!\u201d email scams.\n\nAmerican manufacturing companies are starting to switch over production lines to make masks and other protective equipment here \u2014 but that\u2019s not a quick process and presents its own complications. For example, the nonwoven textiles that N95 respirator masks use to filter out viruses have to be made on special machines. There are only a few of those machines in the whole world, said Julie Swann, professor of industrial and systems engineering at North Carolina State University. And you can\u2019t just go buy a new one off the shelf. Her university is producing some of this material now. \u201cBut not at the volume you\u2019d make at a large manufacturer,\u201d she said.\n\nThe second problem is that a global pandemic causes sudden spikes in demand for certain products. Production is designed for steady demand with predictable increases and decreases. A big, unforeseen event, like a pandemic, throws everything out of whack, said Adegoke Oke, professor of supply chain management at Arizona State University\u2019s school of business. Take our toilet paper woes. That supply chain didn\u2019t account for sudden, nationwide increases in having to pee at home. It also didn\u2019t anticipate every office in the nation suddenly holding it, indefinitely. You might think that the demand in one sector could be met by the excess from the other, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. \u201cThe type of toilet paper you use in the office \u2014 the big rolls \u2014 are totally different from what you use at home,\u201d Oke said. \u201cThey require different supply chains and different manufacturing lines.\u201d\n\nAnd when manufacturing capacity can\u2019t keep up with a sudden surge in demand, there are no emergency backup supply closets to raid. That\u2019s because of a popular and widespread business practice called \u201cjust in time\u201d supply. Essentially, it means that businesses from hospitals to grocery stores keep only a small amount of supplies on hand at any given time \u2014 enough to get through a couple of weeks or a month. Just-in-time saves money on warehouse storage, energy and staffing, but it works only if the supplies can be produced and delivered when you need them. \u201cIt\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Oke said. \u201cBut at a time like this, the last thing you want is just-in-time.\u201d\n\nFinally, supply chains are also getting disrupted in some truly surprising ways \u2014 ripple effects that spread from one industry to another. Take the transportation of goods. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty dependent on European tourism \u2014 80 percent of the air cargo capacity across the Atlantic comes aboard passenger flights. When those all but stopped, it created a transportation bottleneck for manufacturing, said James Robinson, an independent consultant who spent 30 years working in vaccine manufacturing for companies like Merck. Airlines are turning their empty passenger jets into cargo flights, but that takes retrofitting and time and money \u2014 and it\u2019s going to increase the cost of shipping, Robinson said.\n\nThen there\u2019s all the food being trashed in response to a pandemic that\u2019s cleared grocery shelves nationwide. The same parallel but separate home and business supply chains that affect the toilet paper supply also affect food. What people eat in a restaurant or at school \u2014 and how much of it they eat \u2014 isn\u2019t the same as what they eat at home. And the farmers who have typically supplied commercial kitchens don\u2019t have the sales, marketing, packaging and transport networks in place to get their food where it\u2019s needed. Fresh vegetables and milk have simply been thrown out. And that\u2019s not to mention facilities\u2019 closing when food industry workers are taken out by illness or migrant farm workers\u2019 not being able to cross borders at future harvest times \u2014 things that researchers have long predicted could cause food shortages in the U.S. during a time of pandemic. \u201cThe food supply could be vulnerable,\u201d Swann said. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want to scare people.\u201d\n\nThese supply chain issues can also create a weird sort of feedback loop: The virus increases demand for certain products, which jumbles supply chains for those products, which in turn hampers efforts to use those products to keep the virus in check. And that gives the virus time to beat up the economy even more.\n\nWhich is all to say that problems with the PPE supply could be only the beginning. As people like Robinson try to coordinate what will become an international effort to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine in the months ahead, for example, they\u2019re looking at what\u2019s going on with products like PPE \u2014 knowing that the same things could happen to vaccines.\n\n\u201cA vaccine manufacturer like Sanofi might source several thousand ingredients to make a vaccine,\u201d Robinson told me. \u201cBut each material is coming from factories with hundreds of sources, and those sources have sources.\u201d Like the connection between holiday travel and international shipping, supply chains for vaccines can end in unexpected places \u2014 like a Chilean tree farm.\n\nRobinson is vice chair of the scientific advisory committee for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an international organization that helps coordinate funding and research for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. CEPI is involved in the development of 10 different coronavirus vaccines, and Robinson expects at least three of those will eventually make it to widespread use. One of these vaccines, though, uses an adjuvant \u2014 a substance to help strengthen the body\u2019s immune response to a vaccine \u2014 that contains an oil extracted from the Quillaja saponaria Molina tree, common to Peru, Chile and Bolivia. The bark is harvested only between November and January each year, so this year\u2019s harvest didn\u2019t take the new coronavirus into account. There\u2019s only so much of that adjuvant available until next year, Robinson said.\n\nOther expected supply chain issues with vaccines are shaped by years of international trade patterns. For example, doses of vaccines are delivered in glass vials, and there\u2019s been a global shortage of glass stretching back to at least 2015. The medical glass industry was just beginning to catch up with increased demand, Robinson said, and now, novel coronavirus vaccines will create additional pressure. Even if the vaccine is loaded into 10-dose vials, that\u2019s still hundreds of millions of vials that will be needed, he told me. Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a novel coronavirus vaccine that Robinson regards as one of the most promising. \u201c[Janssen has] already preordered 250 million vials, and that might be all that\u2019s out there,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to procure another 200 million.\u201d\n\nWhat it boils down to is that even the vaccine industry isn\u2019t prepared for a sudden increase in demand on this scale \u2014 which would likely far outpace even the spikes associated with a bad flu season. \u201cIn 2009, H1N1 rapidly increased manufacturing and got up to 400 million doses in a year. But for a pandemic, we might need billions,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nThe biggest thing experts are taking away from all this is the weakness of that just-in-time supply chain. \u201cIn lean terminology, inventory is waste because it\u2019s supply you aren\u2019t using,\u201d Robinson said. But now, when demand is sharply rising, that inventory would be helpful \u2014 and so many industries are tied together that when one runs out of supply it affects the ability of other industries to keep functioning.\n\nProduction can be ramped up, and it is. But it takes time and investment \u2014 and it\u2019s important to remember that those investments are a risk. We might need American-made masks now, but will we keep buying them after the threat of COVID-19 has passed? Or will we revert to just-in-time supply from cheaper factories overseas? History suggests the latter. During previous epidemics of influenza, Texas-based company Prestige Ameritech saw demand soar, Swann told me. But it proved to be a boom and bust. The company invested in new machines to meet demand during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Swann said. \u201cAnd then they almost went out of business later because [the Texas company\u2019s product] was a little more expensive than the ones from China,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be willing to pay a little more during times of peace without crisis so we have supply available during crisis.\u201d", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}]}, "fivethirtyeight_economics": {"rss": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/economics/feed/", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/economics/", "articles": [{"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-terrible-jobs-report-gets-worse-the-more-you-read-it/", "published": "2020-05-08T14:18:06", "title": "The Terrible Jobs Report Gets Worse The More You Read It", "text": "Remember last month, when the jobs report was bad but not apocalyptic? Those were the days. The most recent jobs report is a stunning picture of how the pandemic has reshaped the country\u2019s labor market. Overall, 20.5 million fewer people were employed last month than in March. And the unemployment rate has skyrocketed to 14.7 percent \u2014 by far the worst we\u2019ve seen in more than seven decades of economic data.\n\nBut the speed of the crisis also means that these numbers are already out of date. The jobs report is based on surveys of businesses and households taken during the middle of April, but the economic situation likely worsened as the month went on. And key metrics, like the unemployment rate, aren\u2019t capturing all the people who are actually out of work right now. According to this month\u2019s report, millions of workers were counted as employed even though they were absent from work for an unspecified reason \u2014 and if they had been counted as unemployed on a temporary layoff, the unemployment rate would have been 5 percentage points higher. In other words, as catastrophic as this report might seem, it almost certainly understates the pandemic\u2019s full economic devastation.\n\nTo be clear, that\u2019s not the fault of the researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics who put the report together. Our economic data just wasn\u2019t designed for a moment where entire sectors of the economy shut down pretty much overnight, leaving millions of people without jobs. \u201cI think of our economic indicators as being a kind of a finely tuned speedometer that says, \u2018Are we a little over the speed limit or a little under?\u2019\u201d said Matt McDonald, a partner at the consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies who writes a monthly analysis of the jobs report. \u201cAnd right now it\u2019s like we just pulled the emergency brake on the highway.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the report is useless or wrong. But making sense of the numbers \u2014 and what they mean for our ability to recover from this mess \u2014 is going to take a little more work than usual. Here\u2019s what to bear in mind as you read coverage of the jobs report (or dive into the nitty-gritty yourself) that can help you understand just how bad these numbers are, and what they mean for how the recession could play out.\n\nHeadline numbers may understate the damage\n\nThis month, there are good reasons to dig deeper into the report. There\u2019s always a significant amount of uncertainty in one of the topline numbers \u2014 the 20.5 million jobs that were lost \u2014 but the scale of the damage this month means that this month\u2019s estimate could be off by tens or even hundreds of thousands of jobs. Take the initial revision for payroll losses in March. Last month, the BLS reported that 701,000 jobs were lost. In this month\u2019s report, though, it\u2019s adjusted that to 870,000. And the April job losses are much, much larger, which means this month\u2019s report could be underestimating the magnitude of the damage by a significant amount.\n\nThe one thing we know for sure is that the unemployment rate is historically high. The government has been tracking this number for more than 70 years, and up till now, the peaks were 10.8 percent in 1982 and 10.0 percent in 2009. For context, economic historians estimate that during the Great Depression, the unemployment rate hit a peak of about 25 percent.\n\nThe real number may actually be closer to that Great Depression peak, because by this metric, only people without jobs who have been actively looking for one are considered unemployed. In normal times, that\u2019s already a bit of an issue because it means frustrated job seekers who have given up on finding something aren\u2019t counted. Now, the problem is even bigger because so many workers are being encouraged to stay home to combat the coronavirus. Others might not be job-hunting because they believe there\u2019s no work to be had.\n\n\u201cJob search is going to be tough when it\u2019s a public health risk to be in contact with people and whole sectors of the economy is effectively shut down,\u201d said Nick Bunker, a labor economist at the hiring site Indeed. \u201cSo lots of people who are out of work are probably not going to be included in the unemployment rate.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the possibility that some people may have been counted as employed even though it might be more accurate to say they\u2019re temporarily out of work. The misclassification may have happened because of the way workers are surveyed \u2014 if they say they were absent from work during the entire week that\u2019s referenced in the survey, interviewers follow up and ask why. Usually, the reasons fall into a standard set of buckets \u2014 vacation, childcare responsibilities, illness. But the number of workers who said they were absent from work for \u201cother reasons\u201d skyrocketed once the pandemic started, indicating that some people who had actually been furloughed may have misunderstood the question and answered in a way that indicated they were still employed.\n\nThis was a problem the BLS ran into in March, and again in April. In March, the researchers estimated that about 1.4 million people may have been misclassified as employed when they were actually temporarily out of work due to the pandemic; this month, it\u2019s a whopping 7.5 million people. According to the BLS, the April unemployment rate would have been almost 5 percentage points higher if these people were included.\n\nTo get a clearer picture of just how many people are out of a job, there\u2019s another metric in the report that might be more useful \u2014 the share of the adult population who are employed. This number is particularly helpful in recessions, because that\u2019s when more people are likely to become discouraged and stop looking for work. This month, 51.3 percent of the adult population has a job, down from 60 percent in March. That\u2019s also a historic drop \u2014 and yet that number may also underestimate the damage because of the people who may have been mistakenly classified as employed.\n\nThe damage is widespread\n\nIt\u2019s important, too, to look not just at how many people are out of work, but which sectors of the economy have been hit hardest and which are continuing to do well. \u201cThere\u2019s a real question about how many industries can weather this moment,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, an economist at Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative. In March, the job losses were overwhelmingly concentrated in the leisure and hospitality industry, which includes bars and restaurants. This month, those industries were hit hardest again: leisure and hospitality lost 7.7 million jobs, a decline of 47 percent.\n\nBut the overall job losses were more spread out than they were last month, signaling that the effects of the shutdown are already rippling into other industries. For instance, there were sharp declines in the health care sector, mainly concentrated in dentists\u2019 and private doctors\u2019 offices, many of which were forced to close or lost a significant amount of business due to the pandemic. Retail, professional and business services \u2014 including temporary help services and services to businesses and dwellings \u2014 and manufacturing also lost hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nThere were also some noteworthy disparities in who was more likely to be unemployed. The April unemployment rate was highest for Hispanic workers, at 18.9 percent, but black workers (16.7 percent) were also more likely to be unemployed than Asian (14.5 percent) or white (14.2 percent) workers. Racial disparities in the unemployment rate aren\u2019t that unusual \u2014 black workers, for example, generally have a higher unemployment rate than other groups. But the unemployment rate for Hispanic workers in particular was historically high, underscoring a running theme of this pandemic: workers of color are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the economic havoc.\n\nWomen (15.5 percent) also had a higher unemployment rate than men (13 percent) \u2014 which is atypical, since women usually have a lower unemployment rate than men. And in recessions, men are usually the first to feel the impact. But women are more likely to hold jobs in the industries that have been pummeled since the pandemic began, like health care and child care services, which may explain why they\u2019re experiencing more of the job losses this time around.\n\nGimbel told us she\u2019ll also be looking at the diffusion index, which is a measure that shows how many industries are gaining or losing jobs. That number, she said, can tell us at a glance \u201chow widespread the carnage is.\u201d This month, the diffusion index is 4.8, which is shockingly low, and signals that job losses were extremely widespread across industries. In February, for example, the diffusion index was 53.7.\n\nAnother important tidbit that\u2019s not captured in the employment figures but reflects how widespread the damage has been: the number of people who were working part-time because they couldn\u2019t find full-time work or their hours were reduced doubled in April, landing at 10.9 million.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re interested in trying to figure out how painful the recovery might be, you can learn a lot by looking at the share of people who were temporarily laid off in April, rather than permanently fired. This may be the least catastrophic part of the report. As in March, the vast majority of jobs lost in April were temporary: 18.1 million of the newly unemployed said they had lost their jobs temporarily, while 2.0 million said the loss was permanent. To be clear \u2014 in a more normal moment, 2.0 million lost jobs would be an eye-popping number. But the fact that the job losses are mostly temporary is important because it will be much easier for people who have been furloughed to return to work when businesses start to reopen \u2014 assuming, of course, that those businesses haven\u2019t shuttered in the meantime.\n\nRead the fine print\n\nThe jobs report is based on two surveys: one of businesses, and one of ordinary households. Normally, that\u2019s barely worth remarking on. But this is not an ideal time to be doing surveys of businesses or people. Last month, the call centers where the surveys are conducted were shut down, and in-person follow-up interviews aren\u2019t happening either. That increases the uncertainty around the numbers in ways that BLS researchers explained in a 14-page note that accompanied the jobs report.\n\nTake the response rate. Julie Hatch Maxfield, an associate commissioner at the BLS, told us some variation in the share of participants who respond is normal, particularly because the survey of businesses is sometimes conducted on a more truncated timeline. In April, the response rate for the survey of businesses was actually much higher than it was in March. But the response rate for the survey of households was 70 percent, compared to 73 percent in March. That lower response rate introduces more uncertainty \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to know how that uncertainty influenced the data. For example, Gimbel pointed out it\u2019s possible that unemployed people may actually be overrepresented in the household survey, because they have more time to talk with a government interviewer.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s hard to predict what next month\u2019s jobs report will show, it is likely to offer more detail about how the COVID-19 crisis is affecting Americans economically. A series of questions are being added to next month\u2019s survey of households that will capture how the pandemic has changed our work lives \u2014 for instance, whether people are teleworking, or if the crisis has kept them from searching for work. That might not solve all of the problems with the unemployment rate, but it will make the economic picture a little clearer \u2014 although probably not more uplifting.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: COVID-19 broke the jobless claims chart", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux", "Julia Wolfe"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-essential-worker-is-busier-than-ever-without-leaving-her-house/", "published": "2020-05-04T13:00:46", "title": "This Essential Worker Is Busier Than Ever Without Leaving Her House", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis stresses almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net. To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nThe nation\u2019s unemployment statistics are staggering, and the stories of the workers who constitute those numbers are humbling, including those who suddenly had job offers rescinded and those who have seen their hours cut as a result of the coronavirus\u2019s spread.\n\nBut another reality of this downturn is that some have seen an increase in work the past two months. Many of them hold the kind of essential jobs that wouldn\u2019t immediately come to mind.\n\nRomie Faienza, a 39-year-old Massachusetts resident, is one such person. Faienza works as a closed captioner and specializes in live voice writing \u2014 she listens to what is said during an event and carefully repeats that wording into a microphone connected to her computer, where her speech is transcribed into written words.\n\nShe has had her hands full since the pandemic emerged in the United States. Along with the daily briefings that President Trump had been doing, governors from states across the country started holding news conferences on the fallout from COVID-19. The process of transcribing what is said at them, given their importance and that more people who are hard of hearing would be at home watching the news, is both a busy and critical task for the time being.\n\nBefore all this, Faienza was working 40-hour weeks but was plotting out how she would use the time off she had accumulated. \u201cI actually spoke with my supervisor and said I intended to work a lot less\u201d this year, Faienza said, adding that she uses spare time to edit magazine pieces and write screenplays.\n\nBut then the pandemic happened, totally altering that plan. Now, she\u2019s working 50-hour weeks to keep up.\n\nThe demand for her work appears to go beyond just the additional hours. Faienza said another captioning company reached out to her recently, in the hopes of convincing her to consider a job with them. \u201cI said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m flattered, but I can\u2019t entertain the idea of making a big change right now,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThe notion of stability has always been meaningful for Faienza. Her voice has to remain consistently level \u2014 both in terms of volume and intonation \u2014 to ensure her captioning will come across clearly and accurately. And from a financial standpoint, she and her husband had made a point to save pretty aggressively in case something unforeseen came up.\n\nThings seem solid for now for Faienza, who made just less than $50,000 last year and is the family\u2019s breadwinner. With overtime, she\u2019s earning about $200 more per paycheck, and her stimulus money is still on the way as well. Lately, she\u2019s used some of her overtime pay to purchase gift cards at suburban Boston-area restaurants. \u201cI want these places to still be there when all of this is over,\u201d she said.\n\nFaienza\u2019s real challenge has been in areas that others throughout the country can likely relate to: the emotional toll the news can take on those who, like Faienza, have no choice but to immerse themselves in it.\n\nWhile her work itself hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed \u2014 \u201cMy life was already pretty socially distanced, because I work from home in a studio with the door closed,\u201d she said \u2014 it\u2019s challenging for her to put in a few extra hours each day because she has two young sons, 6 and 8 years old. The older child has said he misses being in school \u2014 and not just because he doesn\u2019t get to see his friends and teacher. He told Faienza that he genuinely misses the sense of achievement that accompanies doing a good job on a test or an assignment.\n\nFortunately, the kids are positioned well from a schooling standpoint: Ciro, Faienza\u2019s husband, is serving as their teacher for now. And the transition is likely smoother for him than for other parents, since he already has teaching experience, having previously taught English to people looking to acquire it as a foreign language.\n\nFaienza\u2019s parents, who are about 70 years old, live with the rest of the family, so the concept of leaving the house for an outing of some sort hasn\u2019t been entertained. But the kids seem to have adapted to that part of the deal OK so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all pretty nerdy anyway. Because we\u2019re in Massachusetts, we\u2019ve had snowstorms before, where we\u2019ve been stuck inside for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there\u2019s lots of playing board games, watching movies, playing video games, listening to each other. There\u2019s always been a lot of that. And we do have a backyard, which isn\u2019t huge, but it\u2019s enough to go outside to do chalk drawings or toss the ball around.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the strangest element of all this for Faienza was the timing; it felt as if she were seeing the country through a time machine of sorts. She knew pretty early, for instance, that the coronavirus situation in China had gotten serious because an increasing amount of the news conferences she had to caption here in the states were on that subject. That led her, around the first week of March, to urge her parents to avoid taking communion at church and avoid shaking anyone\u2019s hands there. At that same time, she also told a family friend to place an order for CPAP equipment, since the parts figured to become more difficult to get as the virus continued to spread \u2014 and might possibly shut entire industries down.\n\nThat feeling of time travel grew more surreal as Faienza captioned news conferences in New York, where the virus was ravaging the state. Seeing all the steps that officials were taking there as several other states delayed or opted against implementing stay-at-home orders prompted her to worry the nation didn\u2019t grasp the seriousness of the virus, and that its transmission might not slow down in a timely fashion.\n\nFaienza\u2019s hope now is that, soon enough, we\u2019ll be able to go back in time. Then she will be able to make use of those gift cards she bought to patronize the local restaurants as we get back a semblance of what everyday American life was like before the coronavirus erased that notion for millions of people.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The US is starting to reopen. Is it ready?", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-crises-and-domestic-violence-and-what-that-could-mean-for-covid-19/", "published": "2020-05-04T10:00:10", "title": "What We Know About Crises And Domestic Violence \u2014 And What That Could Mean For COVID-19", "text": "The novel coronavirus pandemic, in addition to its direct impact on people\u2019s health, has unleashed a perfect storm of conditions that may increase the rate of domestic violence. Social isolation, for example, is one of the most common tactics used by abusers to distance survivors from their support networks, and now physical isolation is government-sanctioned. Unemployment claims are hitting historic highs, as are levels of economic anxiety; both of these circumstances are linked to a higher incidence of domestic violence. Firearm ownership is tied to a greater chance of domestic homicide, and gun sales in the U.S. rocketed in March, with reports that many of those sales were to first-time gun buyers. National hotlines even have to devise strategies to combat abusers\u2019 weaponizing COVID-19 itself to terrorize survivors \u2014 e.g., threatening to infect someone with COVID-19 or hiding cleaning supplies so the survivor cannot access them.\n\nThe relationship between these factors and domestic violence is well researched and well documented, as many other articles have discussed. But tracking the pandemic\u2019s actual effects on domestic violence is nearly impossible. Many people who experience abuse don\u2019t report it through official channels. Stigma and fear of retribution are just a few of the reasons someone wouldn\u2019t contact the police. Because of that, we don\u2019t have good data showing domestic violence incidence in normal times, let alone now. In fact, we\u2019re getting conflicting signals at the moment \u2014 while the National Domestic Violence Hotline continued to see its average of 1,800 to 2,000 contacts a day through March and April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Friday that reports of domestic violence rose in the state during that same time.\n\nSo while we have solid, empirically derived reasons to believe that COVID-19 might increase the rate of domestic violence across the country, we don\u2019t have the numbers to back that claim. That can make the issue feel less real to the public and to policymakers, even though, due to the impact of COVID-19, the increase in intimate partner violence (IPV) \u2014 i.e., physical, psychological or sexual harm in an intimate relationship \u2014 may be significant.\n\nHow significant? There\u2019s no perfect case study to draw from, but we can make some reasonable conclusions by looking at research on IPV and past disasters with some similarities to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nEconomic anxiety and joblessness\n\nEconomic hardship, employment instability, unemployment and perceptions of economic strain have all been linked to IPV, according to Jennifer Copp, a professor at Florida State University\u2019s College of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Domestic violence is about power and control, and when your job, finances and livelihood are all up in the air, abuse becomes a place where people seek to regain that sense of control.\n\nIndeed, a 2001 research report from the National Institute of Justice found that rates of violence in couples experiencing high levels of financial stress were 3 1/2 times the rates in couples with low levels of stress \u2014 rising to 9.5 percent from 2.7 percent. According to a working paper by the Center for Global Development, the effects of unemployment on IPV vary across populations due to cultural differences, but in the U.S., the NIJ found in 2009 that periods of unemployment by a man in a heterosexual relationship are correlated with significantly elevated rates of abuse. That paper didn\u2019t show a causal link but found that couples in which the man was employed had a 4.7 percent prevalence of abuse, while that figure was 7.5 percent for couples in which the man experienced one period of unemployment and 12.3 percent for couples in which the man experienced two or more periods of unemployment.\n\nEconomically, the most recent circumstances analogous to the current pandemic may be those caused by the Great Recession, when the overall unemployment rate doubled from 5 percent in December 2007 to 10 percent in October 2009 and the net worth of households and nonprofits fell over 20 percent, a loss of some $14 trillion, in a year and a half. A 2016 study published in \u201cDemography\u201d on economic indicators and IPV during the Great Recession found that an increase in the unemployment rate was correlated with a small but significant change in IPV \u2014 a 50 percent increase in the unemployment rate over the prior 12-month period, for example, was associated with a 10 to 12 percent increase in the prevalence of physically violent or controlling behavior in intimate relationships.\n\nOf course, a correlation between economic hardship and IPV may be due to other factors that are linked to greater hardship or job loss and IPV \u2014 such as mental illness, stress or substance abuse. Establishing a causal relationship is much more difficult since economic hardship typically goes hand in hand with many other variables. Yet coupled with what we know about the interplay of economic precarity and domestic violence, the economic fallout of COVID-19 presents perhaps one of the greatest risks in terms of increasing abuse.\n\nNatural disasters\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult to draw comparisons between behavior after natural disasters and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, though, women have a much more precarious social and economic standing than men, and that vulnerability only increases during a disaster. Normal resources and social support that usually curb abuse can disappear entirely depending on the type of disaster \u2014 hotlines, access to legal help and shelter availability can all be disrupted. On top of that, IPV increases in the aftermath of disasters, but many factors are at play that don\u2019t apply as much to COVID-19 \u2014 most notably displacement, which is not yet a major effect of the pandemic.\n\nWhile research has shown that economic downturns are accompanied by physical, mental and emotional violence, the intersection of gender-based violence and disasters is only a recent area of focus. It\u2019s unclear whether increased violence is a simple matter of proximity or of stress or some other unknown variable.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth looking at some examples that may hold lessons for dealing with the current pandemic, as long as we keep in mind that the circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis are quite different. In 2011, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch, New Zealand, causing 185 deaths and thousands of injuries in addition to severe structural damage. Two weeks after the earthquake, area police said that reports of domestic violence had risen by a fifth. Afterward, police cited business closures as a reason why more people were drinking at home, aggravating the risk of domestic violence. Sexual violence rose after Hurricane Katrina, as many people were forced into temporary shelters. In the first six months after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, nearly 40 percent of sexual assaults were committed by strangers (versus the 19.5 percent committed by strangers in all reported cases of sexual assault in the U.S.); 31 percent of these assaults took place in shelters or evacuation sites. For people whose lives were highly disrupted by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, there was a nearly threefold increase in the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence afterward compared with people who experienced no disruption.\n\nOne of the most striking findings to come out of research on domestic violence in the wake of a natural disaster is that, separate from the rate of abuse changing, the severity of abuse can increase as well. In the aforementioned study of sexual assaults after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, researchers found that in the early aftermath of the disaster, \u201crapes appeared to be more brutal, often involving multiple offenders,\u201d and then returned to a more typical pattern a year later. After the 1997 Red River Valley flood, which displaced over 50,000 people in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and damaged nearly all homes in the area, referrals to domestic violence shelters from emergency rooms increased, possibly pointing to a rise in severity of physical abuse. Even now, Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said that survivors contacting them have seen an escalation in abuse tactics \u2014 including one person who said her partner pulled out a gun to prevent her from leaving the house, something that had never happened before.\n\nIn some ways at least, the COVID-19 pandemic is less problematic regarding IPV than other disasters: Most hotlines are still operational, and while shelter availability varies depending on locale, there hasn\u2019t been a natural event that wipes out the structures. Many domestic violence services are still operating and are able to offer support, although survivors may be less willing to go to one for fear of catching COVID-19. Nathaniel Fields, CEO of Urban Resource Institute in New York, an organization that provides resources and shelter for survivors of domestic violence, said that their priority right now is communication \u2014 when everyone, including your friends, neighbors and the government, is telling you to stay home, it can be hard to leave an abusive situation. Survivors find themselves doing the mental calculus of whether it\u2019s safer to stay home with the devil you know or risk the COVID-19 you don\u2019t.\n\nBut those silver linings aside, the COVID-19 pandemic is still likely meaningfully increasing the rate of domestic violence. Past downturns and disasters doubled or even tripled those rates. Those were each unique circumstances, making it hard to say if something similar will happen now. Indeed, Claire Renzetti, a professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky, didn\u2019t offer any speculation as to the scale of an increase. But she said that knowing what we know from previous experiences that haven\u2019t been as bad as this one, our current economic climate will likely increase IPV.\n\nMoreover, in normal times, domestic violence doesn\u2019t affect all populations equally, and these inequities are likely to be exacerbated during the pandemic. Some studies have found that low-income, black and Hispanic populations are more likely to experience IPV than white populations or those with post-secondary education. Those are the same groups bearing a disproportionate share of the direct health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t have the data to show much of this for years, if ever. Data collection during disasters suffers from logistical difficulties, and quantitative insights on domestic violence are chronically underreported. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\n\nLaura Bronner contributed research.\n\nHelp is available.

If we add up all of the initial claims filed since the coronavirus recession began, more than 30 million people \u2014 or nearly 19 percent of the total U.S. labor force \u2014 have filed for unemployment claims over the past month and a half.\n\nExperts have all had their eyes trained on initial unemployment claims, both because they tell us about the ongoing scale of the crisis and because they\u2019re one of the rare weekly indicators of the economy at large. Some economists think this weekly trend of massive unemployment numbers includes industries that weren\u2019t hit hard at first but are now beginning to feel the ripple effects of the recession as it spreads through the economy. \u201cJob separations will likely remain high for a while, as softer demand spills over into industries not initially directly affected by shutdowns,\u201d Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst told Reuters. (This is corroborated by sources such as the hiring site Indeed, which has consistently seen 30 to 40 percent fewer jobs posted than the norm since late March.)\n\nOf course, this week\u2019s data still includes many unemployment claims that overwhelmed state agencies were not able to process immediately after they were filed. And there are still many workers struggling week by week in industries directly affected by coronavirus shutdowns, such as in restaurants or other parts of the service sector. Several weeks ago, we pointed to research by St. Louis Fed economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro, who estimated that nearly 50 million jobs were at risk as the country tried to mitigate the virus\u2019s spread. If our current slight downward pattern of initial claims continues each week, we would reach that mark by July.\n\nBut will the numbers continue in that same pattern? One of the hallmarks of this crisis is the high number of furloughs \u2014 people who are out of work now (and therefore able to file initial claims) but who could potentially return to their jobs when the economy restarts. A recent analysis from the California Policy Lab found that 90 percent of that state\u2019s workers who filed for unemployment in early April expected to go back to their previous jobs, a much higher share than the 40 percent who gave that response in February. With many states moving toward reopening at least some businesses by next week, a large number of those who filed claims earlier in the crisis could potentially be returning to work.\n\nThat\u2019s why another important indicator will be what\u2019s called continued claims, or insured unemployment \u2014 the number of people actually receiving unemployment benefits in any given week. (According to the Department of Labor, that number was 17,992,000 for the week ending April 18.) It lags a week behind initial claims, since not all initial claimants are actually eligible to receive payments, but it gives us a faster-moving measure of where the crisis might be headed than the traditional unemployment rate, which is released each month. The decline of continued claims tends to go in lockstep with the end of recessions, and it will be important to watch how that metric changes as the restarting economy begins to go through another phase of incredible upheaval over the next month.\n\n\u2018We have a ways to go until data\u2019 allows states to reopen: Nate Silver", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-americans-who-suffered-when-the-economy-shut-down-are-also-in-more-danger-as-it-reopens/", "published": "2020-04-28T16:33:33", "title": "The Americans Who Suffered When The Economy Shut Down Are Also In More Danger As It Reopens", "text": "It\u2019s been more than six weeks since Daniel last rode his bike to his office, where he works on the business operations team at a beverage company in the Pacific Northwest. At first he was apprehensive about working from home for the indefinite future, but within a few weeks he realized he was feeling more focused and productive than ever before. Even when restrictions are lifted on companies like his, he doesn\u2019t expect to be spending a lot of time at the office. \u201cI\u2019ll go back for certain meetings if things start to reopen, but for the most part I think we\u2019re going to be remote for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.\n\nDaniel knows not everyone has that luxury. \u201cI just keep saying to myself \u2014 I\u2019m one of the lucky ones, because I\u2019ve basically been able to continue working unaffected,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the COVID-19 crisis continues, the ability to work from home could turn into one of the most important markers of privilege for American workers.\n\nAccording to a survey of 25,000 respondents fielded online April 1\u20135, more than 34 percent of people who were employed four weeks earlier reported that they used to commute to work, but were now working from home. Add that to the nearly 15 percent of respondents who said they were already working from home, and nearly half the country is teleworking.\n\nBut the ability to work remotely isn\u2019t randomly distributed \u2014 it\u2019s concentrated among people who are already more likely to have higher incomes and more stable employment.\n\nIn a recent working paper, economists Simon Mongey, Laura Pilossoph and Alex Weinberg created two metrics to understand which workers will be hit especially hard by the coronavirus crisis, using data from the Labor Department. The first measures the extent to which a given occupation can be performed from home, and the other measures the amount of close proximity to other people that the job requires. Sure enough, the jobs that are likely harder to do from home or are more likely to involve close physical proximity tend to be filled by people who are more economically vulnerable. For instance, jobs that are more difficult to work from home are disproportionately held by lower-income workers.\n\nThis research generally aligns with other recent studies that have found that the COVID-19 crisis has had a bigger economic impact on people with lower incomes and levels of education. That dynamic is now going to force many poorer Americans to choose between their safety and a paycheck as the economy starts to reopen.\n\nOne of those workers who could soon be facing that unpleasant calculus is Erica Harrison, who lost her job setting up displays at a department store in Louisiana last month. She was already struggling to live on $12 per hour, and spent the last few weeks scrambling to get her unemployment insurance payments set up so she could buy groceries and make her car payments. Now she finally has enough money to support herself \u2014 but a few days after her benefits started to arrive, her supervisor called to ask how she\u2019d feel about coming back to her job if the store was able to reopen.\n\nThe idea of returning to work knocked her back on her heels. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying thought because the risk of getting sick is so high,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s literally my job to touch everything in the store \u2014 the fixtures, the mannequins, the plexiglass.\u201d She lives with her mother, who recently recovered from heart surgery, so Harrison is especially concerned about spreading the virus to family members. But she had to take her supervisor\u2019s question seriously. She lost her health insurance along with her job, and she\u2019s wary of turning down work in the midst of a recession. And she would probably no longer qualify for unemployment benefits if she was offered her job back and chose not to return. \u201cIn my mind it pretty much comes down to: do you care more about your money or your health?\u201d she said. \u201cI wish there was a way for me to stay indoors and keep getting my paycheck. But that option is not available to me.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Harrison isn\u2019t simply that it\u2019s impossible to do her job from home. Her job also involves close contact with other people, putting her at higher risk for contracting or spreading the virus if she did come back to work. She isn\u2019t alone. The economists\u2019 research shows that jobs that require close physical proximity are disproportionately occupied by poorer Americans.\n\nAnd the workers who are disproportionately represented in both kinds of jobs are also more economically vulnerable. Many of the jobs where working from home is more difficult are held by workers without a college degree, and those workers are also overrepresented in jobs that require more face-to-face interaction. The same is true of lower-income workers, who make up more than half of workers in jobs where working from home is unlikely to be feasible and of jobs that involve closer proximity to other people.\n\nThis means that workers who were hit hardest by the economic shutdown are also disproportionately likely to suffer as the recovery unfolds. In places where the economy is being reopened more quickly, they\u2019ll have to confront the prospect of returning to dangerous work before the virus is fully contained. In places where economic activity is remaining frozen for longer \u2014 or only only partially resuming \u2014 they may face longer-term unemployment if their employers can\u2019t reopen quickly or fully. Unemployment benefits can be a salve, especially since the federal government temporarily boosted the amounts by $600 per week. But many Americans\u2019 benefits have not been processed. And that extra money is currently scheduled to stop at the end of July. But the economy probably won\u2019t be back to normal by then. \u201cIf the recovery begins by bringing back workers who are in jobs where they don\u2019t have a lot of contact with other people, that will mean people in high physical proximity jobs will be hurting economically for longer,\u201d Mongey said.\n\nOf course, not everyone who has transitioned to teleworking is leading a charmed life. Daniel was almost apologetic about his good fortune \u2014 he\u2019s young, with no kids and a well-paying job, leaving him plenty of time for Zoom catch-ups with friends and road biking. In some ways, his financial situation has actually improved. He and his partner are rarely ordering out for food, and he got a flood of refunds as races he\u2019d signed up to run over the next few months were canceled.\n\nBut other workers, like Kyrie Martin, a high school math teacher in California, told us they can\u2019t wait to get back to their old, analog workplace. \u201cIt\u2019s maddening enough to try to teach AP Statistics remotely without my first-grade daughter coming in and playing hangman with the students on the whiteboard behind me,\u201d Martin said. But she was quick to add how lucky she felt to still be working.\n\nAnd Martin\u2019s job as a public school teacher probably isn\u2019t in danger of disappearing. As Harrison weighed her options, she was alarmed to see reports that big department stores like Neiman Marcus have been among the first economic casualties of the economic crisis. She wonders if her employer might be next, even if it manages to reopen. \u201cIf I\u2019m questioning if it\u2019s safe to come to work for a paycheck, who\u2019s going to want to come in of their own free will to shop?\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s not an irrational fear. After past recessions, some of the lost jobs didn\u2019t come back when the recovery began \u2014 particularly lower-paying positions that don\u2019t require specialized skills.\n\nIn the meantime, Harrison\u2019s days are full of anxiety and boredom. \u201cWhen this quarantine started, I tried to get up early, keep up a routine, stay productive, but that\u2019s kind of fallen apart,\u201d she said. \u201cPretty much my only regular activity these days is going to the store to see if they\u2019ve restocked on Lysol.\u201d When her unemployment benefits started to hit her bank account, she could at least stop worrying about covering next month\u2019s car payment. But she\u2019s not optimistic about what will happen when the economy begins to open up again. \u201cWhen things start going back to normal, I think I\u2019m going to end up sick or unemployed.\u201d\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux", "Julia Wolfe"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/he-moved-to-the-city-and-started-a-thriving-business-then-he-needed-a-loan-to-make-rent/", "published": "2020-04-27T13:00:37", "title": "He Moved To The City And Started A Thriving Business.

Please share your experience with us.\n\nAs 40-year-old Adam Bee approached his one-year anniversary as a New York City resident, he felt more and more confident that his decision to move there was a good one.\n\nBee had recently moved to the big city to start work as a sort of consultant, and business was taking off. He had just led a successful work retreat, and his client bookings were reaching new heights both in number and frequency. The uptick allowed the Tennessee native to rent a bigger two-bedroom apartment \u2014 which meant he could see clients from a home office \u2014 and gave him the money to finally purchase a monthly health care plan in March.\n\nBut as the novel coronavirus started to spread early that month, businesses shut down rapidly, perhaps none more rapidly than Bee\u2019s. As a sex coach \u2014 he works with individuals and couples to be more in sync sexually and spiritually \u2014 Bee saw his income dry up all at once, even before stay-at-home orders were issued for New York state.\n\nShould we sacrifice our data privacy to fight the coronavirus?\n\n\u201cIt was my decision to shut things down and cancel the remaining classes I had scheduled,\u201d said Bee, whose coaching sessions were held in person. \u201cIt just felt like the ethical thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut the hit was significant. At the peak of his success, he was bringing in between $8,000 and $12,000 a month, charging clients $3,500 for a set of five sessions. (In a global city like New York, the demand for his \u201csacred-intimacy\u201d services \u2014 and clients\u2019 ability to pay for them \u2014 was a key part of Bee\u2019s calculation to move there.) In his mind, there wasn\u2019t an immediate way to still do his work safely and in person while justifying that kind of cost, especially with other people finding themselves out of work by the millions because of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI was in a complete place of fear,\u201d Bee said. \u201cFor the first two weeks of this, I just kind of stared at the wall.\u201d He gave some thought to looking for work in his previous fields \u2014 politics and marketing \u2014 before realizing that those options, too, had likely thinned considerably as a result of the cratering economy. Between the wails of ambulance sirens, he\u2019d break down in tears at times, thinking about just how dire his situation was: \u201cI was going to be homeless in a matter of days.\u201d\n\nIneligible for unemployment, Bee has done what he could do to eliminate spending. The bronze health care plan he\u2019d gotten days earlier for $476 a month with a $5,000 deductible? He scrapped it entirely and followed that up by applying for Medicaid (his application has been approved). The virus has made Bee more or less terrified of walking into a grocery store, so he limits himself to one trip every three weeks now. That has also helped him save money, though his diet these days has gotten pretty mundane, consisting mostly of grains and beans.\n\nThe biggest financial help for Bee was a $10,000 loan from a friend to cover his Upper East Side rent until his lease expires. \u201cThat was pretty fucking special,\u201d he said of his friend\u2019s generosity. Bee plans to hunt for a cheaper living situation once the lease runs out this summer.\n\nThe other bright spot has been the slight rebound in Bee\u2019s business. After those initial despondent weeks, he eventually concluded that it might be possible to do his coaching virtually, as opposed to in-person only. With that in mind, Bee spruced up his website, and by the third week of March, he began holding virtual sessions. That first week alone, he coached more than 100 people. \u201cMy web traffic is more than double what it used to be,\u201d he said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that things are back to how they were before. Bee is charging a mere fraction of his old rate \u2014 $750 for five sessions \u2014 so it takes him five times as many virtual bookings to make what he earned for in-person meetings. \u201cI\u2019m having to work more now than I ever have in my life,\u201d he said.\n\nBee is cautiously optimistic that his in-person clients will return once society is closer to normal again, adding to his burgeoning online business. \u201cI\u2019ve got clients in five states and a couple different countries now,\u201d he said.

After spiking to 6.9 million for the week ending on March 28, the number of new seasonally adjusted claims has gone down each successive week, though the numbers are still astronomical. About 26.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment over the past five weeks, the same number you would get if you added up the initial-claims numbers from March 14 going back to Nov. 25 \u2026 of 2017.\n\nJust to put all of this further in perspective: If the total U.S. labor force is 163 million strong, at least 16 percent of it has now lost a job since mid-March. (And that\u2019s without even accounting for the previous unemployment rate of around 3.5 percent that existed before the coronavirus really hit the U.S.) COVID-19 is creating an unemployment crisis unlike anything America has seen in a very, very long time.\n\nPerhaps that explains some of why we\u2019re beginning to see backlash against the full stay-at-home orders that have been enacted in 42 states and the District of Columbia as a means of slowing the coronavirus\u2019s spread. A number of states have seen protesters descend on their capitols to decry the lockdowns, and the governors of several states, including Georgia and South Carolina, have announced plans to reopen their economies.\n\nPublic outcry is not exactly unexpected when frustrations mount over lost wages in the middle of a national disaster. But are the protests really about unemployment and economic hardship? In some states, it would make sense \u2014 if you add up the advance unemployment claims filed in Michigan since March 15, they account for 24 percent of the state\u2019s labor force. That\u2019s a massive amount of unemployment, the likes of which would seem to be driving the anger we saw in Lansing last week. However, the relationship isn\u2019t nearly as clear-cut when you look at every state.\n\nOverall, according to news reports, there were 28 states over the past week with gatherings of at least 100 people protesting stay-at-home orders and six with at least 1,000 people, out of a possible 42 states (plus Washington, D.C.) with shelter-in-place orders. When looking at what would predict whether a locked-down state would have a protest of at least 100 people, we broke down each state based on the share of the labor force that has filed advance claims since March 15; the state\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus cases; the number of days since the state enacted the lockdown; and the party affiliation of the governor. Here are the averages in each of those categories, depending on whether the state saw a protest:\n\nProtest states have had less COVID-19 \u2014 and unemployment Economic, public-health and political averages among states (and the District of Columbia) with lockdown orders, by whether the state had an anti-lockdown protest of at least 100 people States with\u2026 Protests No Protest Count 28 15 Advance claims as share of labor force 15.0% 16.3% COVID-19 cases per million 1,933.3 2,685.0 Days since lockdown 26.5 26.9 Share w/ Democratic governors* 57.1% 60.0% *Including the mayor of Washington, D.C. Sources: Department of Labor, The New York Times\n\nNone of the differences above are statistically significant, but they do show a few interesting trends about which states have protests \u2014 and why. On average, states with protests have 28 percent fewer confirmed coronavirus cases than states without protests, which might play into a mindset that places the economic fallout of the crisis ahead of the virus\u2019s health implications. But states with protests have also seen smaller shares of their workforce file advance unemployment claims than their counterparts, which suggests that the protests are not purely economic in nature. (Although 15 percent of the labor force filing for unemployment in a five-week span is certainly not nothing.) Protest states have also been under lockdown for slightly fewer days, on average, than states without protests.\n\nPerhaps most surprising in this breakdown is that a larger share of protest states had Republican governors than the states without protests, given the perception (from states like Michigan and California) that protesters \u2014 often organized by conservative interest groups \u2014 were trying to undermine Democratic governors\u2019 stay-at-home orders. (Then again, maybe this simply speaks to a more right-leaning tendency for the populations of states that saw protests.)\n\nAs the job-loss numbers continue to pile up over the coming weeks, we may see even more people pile out of their houses to argue against the coronavirus stay-at-home orders. But the numbers above show that there\u2019s more than just economics at work behind the protests.\n\nSara Ziegler contributed research.", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-is-hard-for-everyone-its-even-harder-for-parents-who-dont-make-much-money/", "published": "2020-04-23T18:59:29", "title": "This Is Hard For Everyone. It\u2019s Even Harder For Parents Who Don\u2019t Make Much Money.", "text": "The COVID-19 crisis has turned parents\u2019 lives upside down. Kids are home from school and daycare, and parents of all economic means are struggling to care for them. But while parents who are still working might be teetering between madness and exhaustion, workers who have suddenly lost jobs and income are facing a different kind of balancing act. That\u2019s particularly the case for low-wage workers. Even when the economy was good, many were already struggling with stress and financial insecurity. Now they\u2019re in an even more precarious position.\n\nA recent survey of low-wage parents gives us an unusually detailed window into the stressful new reality that some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable families are facing. Elizabeth Ananat, an economics professor at Barnard College and Anna Gassman-Pines, a public policy professor at Duke University, started the study last summer. The plan was to periodically survey the same pool of almost 700 parents who work for hourly wages in the service industry in a large U.S. city, recording the everyday pressures and anxieties that shaped low-income families\u2019 lives. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and their project took on new meaning.\n\nBy chance, one of their surveys was conducted between late February and late March, and captured the impact of last month\u2019s economic trainwreck in real time. The first inkling that something profound had changed in the survey participants\u2019 lives came in mid-March. That was right around the time that the city where they lived issued a sweeping lockdown order, closing schools and nonessential businesses. (The researchers are keeping the city anonymous to protect participants\u2019 privacy.) Two things happened almost immediately: According to a series of short daily surveys, respondents\u2019 mental health took a sudden nosedive, and so did the hours they reported having worked that day. \u201cThis is a group that\u2019s already experiencing a lot of stress, so any increase is noteworthy,\u201d Gassman-Pines said. \u201cAnd their stress and anxiety went way, way up after the nonessential businesses closed and their work hours fell.\u201d\n\nIt also exposed how quickly their financial situation could turn from precarious to untenable. In addition to their monthlong survey, Ananat and Gassman-Pines sent out a separate, one-time survey in late March to gauge in more detail how respondents were doing. Less than half of the parents surveyed said that they would get any pay for lost work, including sick leave. And more than one-third reported that their income had fallen by more than half since the crisis began. Almost half of the parents in their sample had already lost their jobs.\n\nThe research gives a rare glimpse into what happened to this group of people during the devastating two-week window in March when millions of low-wage workers abruptly lost their jobs. Most of the surveys you\u2019re used to reading about on FiveThirtyEight are designed to give a broad, comprehensive snapshot of how Americans of all stripes feel about a particular issue. But in pursuit of a result that is actually representative of the country, pollsters and researchers often sacrifice the ability to zero in on the experiences of small, highly specific slices of the population, such as the low-wage parents in Ananat and Gassman-Pines\u2019s survey. Their findings are, in turn, limited in important ways \u2014 their respondents live in the same city, work in the same types of jobs (like retail, hospitality or house cleaning), and are all parents of young children. But when I talked to parents across the country who lost jobs and income as a result of the COVID-19 crisis \u2014 many of whom were already struggling financially \u2014 their stress and anxiety was palpable, and most were struggling to find any kind of support.\n\nMuch of the impact is falling on mothers like Chelsey Johnson, 27, who lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with her 10-year-old daughter. (Johnson was not part of the survey.) Right after she lost her job as a server and bartender at a local Creole restaurant, she tried to apply for unemployment insurance and was told she wasn\u2019t eligible because a previous employer hadn\u2019t paid into the program. She found another job, bagging and delivering lunches to local kids, but it pays less and puts her in contact with other people all day.\n\nFor women like Johnson, the COVID-19 crisis is magnifying the inequalities they already grapple with on a daily basis. According to research by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, 74 percent of parents in the country\u2019s 40 lowest-paying jobs are mothers. A survey by Lean In conducted in April found that women \u2014 particularly black women \u2014 were more worried than men about paying for basic necessities. It\u2019s no wonder that the pandemic took a greater immediate emotional toll on mothers of children under the age of 18, who were substantially more likely than fathers to say the coronavirus crisis has had a negative impact on their mental health, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in March.\n\n\u201cI just have to keep praying I don\u2019t get the virus because how else am I going to make money for my baby and me?\u201d Johnson said. Everything, she said, felt like it was falling apart \u2014 even her ability to access government resources, like food stamps, that she had gotten before. At work, while she put together lunches, she was on hold with the food stamp office for hours, trying to figure out why she hadn\u2019t received a key piece of paperwork to finish her application. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty positive person and I already knew how to shuffle my money around to make it all work \u2014 pay a little bit on my rent, my car note, try to catch up when I can,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my income is taking a hit and I\u2019m worried about getting sick. This is a whole new level of stress.\u201d\n\nIn theory, Johnson\u2019s predicament should be unusual \u2014 many states loosened restrictions on unemployment insurance to make it easier for the newly jobless to apply, and governments rushed to make other emergency services, like food pickups for kids, available to people who had suddenly lost their income. But Ananat and Gassman-Pines\u2019s survey found that most people who needed these benefits weren\u2019t receiving them quickly. By the end of last month, less than half of the survey respondents who had been laid off had applied for unemployment insurance, and a tiny fraction of applicants (8 percent) had received it. And most of the parents also weren\u2019t getting the government resources that were supposed to help them feed and educate the kids who were suddenly home from school. Only about half of the parents surveyed said that their children were receiving school lessons online, and very small shares said they had accessed emergency benefits like emergency child care or grab-and-go meals.\n\nIn the weeks that have passed since the survey closed, more parents in the survey have undoubtedly started to receive other benefits. But their precarious financial position meant that every day of delay made paying bills or buying food even more difficult. In late March, some parents in the survey were already struggling to pay for essentials: About one-fifth of respondents said they would be unable to pay rent in the next month if the crisis continued. And the creaky machinery of government bureaucracy has delayed unemployment insurance payments, snarled food stamp applications and held up relief checks.\n\nEven the prospect of applying for unemployment insurance was difficult for Israel Torres, 35, a father of two who works as a culinary specialist at a university in Los Angeles. When we spoke, the university was planning to furlough its workers in a few days. (They ended up extending the deadline by a month after pressure from the workers and the union.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to stay calm and not make this situation stressful for the kids, but it\u2019s really hard when I\u2019m thinking all the time about what happens if I stop getting paid, how I\u2019ll cover my bills,\u201d he said. Torres and his family live paycheck to paycheck, he said, and they were already struggling because he lost his second job at a theater that closed down early in the crisis.

It was difficult enough, he said, to try to keep the children entertained and engaged with their schoolwork, and avoid falling into a depression. \u201cI know I can apply for unemployment insurance if I get furloughed but I don\u2019t know how much money I\u2019d get or when it would come in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it would be too late for us.\u201d\n\nThen there are the parents who won\u2019t get any government aid at all \u2014 in particular, people who are living in the country illegally and aren\u2019t eligible for benefits.

Last Tuesday, an International Monetary Fund report said that the world is hurtling toward the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Economists at big investment banks have warned more or less the same: Goldman Sachs recently predicted that U.S. GDP would shrink by 34 percent in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of the year, and Morgan Stanley forecasts that this year, we could see the steepest drop in annual GDP growth since 1946.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Economists aren\u2019t especially good at predicting recessions. In this instance, with at least 20 million people out of work in the U.S. and pretty much every country suffering from the pandemic, it seems almost certain that we\u2019re in one. But forecasting the path of a recession isn\u2019t an easy task under the best of circumstances. And we are not living through the best of circumstances right now. \u201cThis is not a situation where you can push a button on the computer and out comes a number,\u201d said Jonathan Wright, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s detective work. And it will mostly be wildly wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd we also don\u2019t know how it will be wrong. The forecasters are pretty much in agreement that the next months are going to be full of economic pain \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot less consensus about how quickly the economy will bounce back. Goldman Sachs, for example, is predicting an \u201cunprecedented\u201d recovery in the second half of the year, once businesses start to reopen. The chief of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, meanwhile, says she\u2019s expecting a much more gradual return to positive economic growth. If anything, a recent study suggests that forecasters tend to be too optimistic about when recession recoveries will begin, which means the return to a normal economy could be slower and bumpier than many economists are currently predicting.\n\nLook at recession predictions for the past year, and you\u2019ll start to understand why some economists raise an eyebrow at some of their colleagues\u2019 efforts to play Cassandra. After a flurry of ominous warnings about an impending recession last summer, most forecasters were predicting a strong year for the U.S. economy. Gregory Daco, the chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told me a story about a presentation he gave at a conference on the global economic outlook back in February. At that moment, the novel coronavirus mostly hadn\u2019t reached U.S. shores, but Daco had been keeping an eye on the virus in China and told the assembled crowd of economists that in a worst-case scenario, U.S. GDP growth could fall as low as 0 percent in 2020. Some people in the audience were not pleased. \u201cIt got back to me that they thought my estimate was way too pessimistic \u2014 there was no way we would be in an environment where the U.S. economy wouldn\u2019t grow because of the virus,\u201d Daco said.\n\n\u2018We shouldn\u2019t criticize early (COVID-19) models for seeming too pessimistic\u2019: Silver\n\nIt\u2019s amazing what two months can do. Now, with much of the global economy on lockdown, that prediction feels outlandishly optimistic. Daco\u2019s latest estimate is that the economy will contract by 4 percent over the course of 2020 \u2014 assuming a healthy rebound in the last few months of the year.\n\nLargely failing to predict the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, even when it was already wreaking havoc on one of the world\u2019s most populous countries, might seem like a huge mistake. But it\u2019s actually very normal for recessions to catch forecasters by surprise. Forecasters didn\u2019t just fail to predict the global financial crisis of 2008 \u2014 the recession had been rolling along for almost a year before it officially got the label. One study published in 2018 looked at more than 150 recessions across the globe and found that only a handful were successfully predicted by economists. Apparently, professional economic forecasters are an unusually sunny folk \u2014 or at least their predictions are. Research has found that economists consistently overestimate economic growth.\n\nAll of these challenges make sense, when you think about it. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if recessions are black swan events and we should never be prepared for them, but it\u2019s true that they are unexpected and hard to predict,\u201d said Prakash Loungani, an economist at the IMF who studies recession predictions. Forecasting models also rely heavily on historical data, and recessions are rare. Since 1970, the U.S. has only seen seven. And the very nature of recessions make them hard to predict based on the past. \u201cNo model that\u2019s used in normal times will forecast a recession because by definition, it\u2019s a break from normal times,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, the director of macroeconomic policy at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth and a former economist with the Federal Reserve. \u201cSo you have to use your judgment and look at indicators, like the unemployment rate, for clues about what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nTo complicate matters further, each recession is unique, starting with the economic conditions that triggered it. That makes relying on history an even trickier business. \u201cThe last recession was connected to a financial crisis and this one is a public health crisis,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, a professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University. \u201cThis is one of the problems in forecasting recessions \u2014 the people who are experts on the issues underlying the recession this time are not necessarily the same people who were experts last time.\u201d\n\nOnce a recession begins, similar dynamics usually start to emerge \u2014 consumer confidence falls, the stock market tumbles, the unemployment rate goes up. But assumptions about how recessions will unfold or how long they\u2019ll last may not hold up from one crisis to the next, and it can be dangerous to rely on them. A recent study by Loungani found that in 436 recessions since 1990, IMF forecasters mostly predicted a rapid recovery. (Consensus forecasters had a similar track record, but Loungani had a smaller number of predictions to analyze.) In many of those recessions, to be fair, the bounce back was pretty quick. But overall, Loungani found that forecasters did not do a good job of predicting which recessions would drag on for more than a year \u2014 including the global financial crisis of 2008, where economists predicted that a recovery was coming long before indicators like the unemployment rate returned to their pre-recession levels. That misplaced optimism about a quick return to normal may have actually prolonged the recession, according to research by Loungani and others, by spurring politicians to end fiscal stimulus measures before the recovery was fully in swing.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is making economists\u2019 jobs even harder by taking some of the usual sources of uncertainty and turning them upside down. Unlike in past economic downturns, there is pretty much no debate about whether we\u2019re in a recession. That\u2019s in part because the recession was triggered by the government as it sought to respond to the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the economic problem almost immediately because the public health measures we\u2019re taking created it,\u201d Wright said. That\u2019s helpful in one sense, because it allows policymakers to respond quickly. \u201cBut it seems odd to say it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only reason we know we\u2019re in a recession so quickly is because the shock is just enormous.\u201d\n\nKnowing that we\u2019re in a recession also doesn\u2019t make forecasters\u2019 job easier. In fact, the trajectory of this crisis is even harder to predict because it\u2019s so dependent on external factors, like when shelter-in-place orders will be lifted. Wright said it\u2019s possible to get a reasonably accurate estimate of the short-term economic damage from indicators that update quickly, like weekly unemployment claims, electricity consumption or output from other sectors of the economy, such as industrial production or retail sales. But there\u2019s a lot we just don\u2019t know \u2014 for instance, how many small businesses will be able to reopen when the lockdowns end. Their ability to start rehiring workers will have a big impact on how quickly the economy can recover. And even rapidly updating statistics, like those unemployment claims, can\u2019t keep up with the breakneck pace of the economic crisis.\n\nDaco, whose company has started issuing biweekly forecasts for its clients, told me that he\u2019s simply expecting to be wrong a lot. \u201cAs forecasters, we have to approach this with a heavy dose of humility, because we just don\u2019t know how this will evolve,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day we could be assuming a 10-12 week lockdown, but the next day we could be looking at a lockdown that lasts through September and you\u2019ve got to throw yesterday\u2019s assumptions out the window.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the forecasts are useless. But Sinclair told me it\u2019s better to think of them as a range of possible futures, rather than a reliable vision of what will come to be. Right now, she said, there are too many unknowns, starting with the question that\u2019s at the top of everyone\u2019s mind: When will it be safe to leave our homes again?", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/he-works-in-a-grocery-store-but-hes-still-losing-hours/", "published": "2020-04-20T12:40:46", "title": "He Works In A Grocery Store, But He\u2019s Still Losing Hours", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis stresses almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net.

Please share your experience with us.\n\nOvernight stockers at supermarkets were among the first Americans to see how the novel coronavirus might change people\u2019s habits.\n\nCharles Rodriguez, a 26-year-old employee of a supermarket chain in the Greater San Antonio area, had an early indication. Just over a month ago, he walked out of the store to help unload the delivery truck that brought in the next day\u2019s shipment. The sight stopped him dead in his tracks. \u201cIt looked like a holiday truck,\u201d he said, filled to the brim. But it was March 12 \u2014 not Thanksgiving or Christmas.\n\nThe store was preparing for the high volume of shoppers that would flood its aisles as the virus began to shut down many aspects of American life. Still, Rodriguez and his co-workers had no clue how quickly their workload would ramp up to meet the increased demand.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight\n\nHe went from working 32 hours a week to eclipsing 40 hours, even earning some overtime pay. \u201cWe\u2019d normally unload two pallets of low-velocity items [like canned foods and peanut butter]. But then we started getting 17 pallets,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWhat was usually an eight-hour shift started becoming nine or 10 hours because of all the extra stuff.\u201d\n\nThat phenomenally busy streak for Rodriguez, who makes just over $15 an hour, went on for two weeks. But then it ended with a thud.\n\nThe supermarket chain started shifting other workers into overnight stocking, both to cut down on paying overtime and to make better use of employees in less essential departments. For instance, it\u2019s neither necessary nor safe for store employees to hand out food samples right now, so instead of laying those people off, the store has them refilling the shelves after closing. Since then, Rodriguez and many others in his department have actually lost hours.\n\nRodriguez said he appreciates his employer finding a way to avoid letting employees go, even if it means that he gets fewer hours and less pay. But it\u2019s been tough for his department. \u201cNow my shifts are closer to six hours per day, and I\u2019m losing about eight hours per week,\u201d he said. \u201cMy co-workers are hurting, and some of the original overnight stockers are kind of upset to have the extra help, because they want to hit their hours.\u201d\n\nNow that he\u2019s only working around 24 hours per week, Rodriguez said he\u2019s been far more conscious about his spending. His lawn mower stopped working \u2014 \u201cThe grass in our yard is really starting to grow,\u201d he said \u2014 but he\u2019s holding off on buying another one as long as he can. Similarly, his 2005 Kia Optima is on its last legs and has required a few trips to the mechanic. Rodriguez and his wife, Hilary, had been saving for a more environmentally friendly vehicle, but they have decided to put off that purchase for the time being.\n\nRodriguez is fully aware of the risks involved in continuing to work as the virus spreads, and his mother is worried about him. But he\u2019s more concerned about what would happen if he lost his job: He would lose his health care coverage, which helps him pay for the medication that treats his hypothyroidism.\n\nBut Rodriguez and his wife are grateful that their situation isn\u2019t worse. They are living at the house of his father \u2014 who is in the military and is stationed elsewhere \u2014 so they aren\u2019t facing the pressure of paying a mortgage or monthly rent. And as Charles\u2019s income has decreased during the pandemic, Hilary\u2019s has increased because of it.\n\nHilary works for a grocery-delivery service, and with people increasingly reluctant to leave their homes, she is fielding almost more orders than she can handle. \u201cBefore, she was happily working 28 hours a week. Now she\u2019s at 40,\u201d and making about $17 an hour, Charles said. \u201cWe basically switched places: She\u2019s making what I got on my old paycheck, and I\u2019m now making what she did before.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s an upside to working inside a grocery store these days, it\u2019s that the couple have been able to shop for themselves before or after their shifts, rather than making separate trips to pick over whatever might be left at busier shopping times. Workers can shop before the store opens each morning by showing their employee badges. (There are still strict item limitations, though, to prevent hoarding.)\n\nRodriguez and his wife have a storage bin of essentials in their home, just in case of emergency situations like this. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t touched it yet,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, he hopes that his already-diminished hours at work won\u2019t drop any further.

In the prior week, 6.6 million Americans had filed for unemployment insurance; the week before that, it was nearly 6.9 million. But today\u2019s number still means that a previously unthinkable 22 million unemployment claims have been filed since March 15.\n\nThis decline might signal that the biggest single-week job-loss numbers are behind us, between the initial wave of layoffs and the backlog of people who were unable to file claims earlier because of overloaded state unemployment agencies. But as we noted several weeks ago, economists think there may be 25 million more Americans at risk for layoffs, based on the industries hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. So even if the peak for weekly unemployment claims is over, the chart above could end up having a long tail, depending on how long Americans have to stay inside to combat the coronavirus.\n\nSome states are at different points in that progression than others. If we look at advance claims \u2014 which are reported weekly by state but are not identical to initial claims \u2014 we find that Maine saw the biggest decline week-over-week, with 57 percent fewer claims last week than the previous week. Claims in Michigan, which had seen huge total unemployment numbers, declined by 43 percent last week, more than twice as much as the national average (-19.9 percent). A similar story can be told in some other large states, including Ohio (-30 percent), Illinois (-30 percent) and California (-29 percent).\n\nOverall, only nine states or territories saw an increase in people seeking unemployment benefits last week, including North Carolina (+0.3 percent), Florida (+7 percent) and New York (+15 percent).

Now they\u2019re scrambling to get ahead of the pandemic, before it ends up affecting even our ability to produce the vaccines we hope will stop the disease in its tracks.\n\n\u201cUp until a few weeks ago, I knew very little about the supply chain,\u201d said Megan Ranney, a professor of emergency medicine at Brown University. \u201cIt always just worked. But I\u2019ve learned a bunch, and it\u2019s more fragile than we ever thought possible.\u201d COVID-19 has forced her \u2014 and lots of other hospitalists around the country \u2014 to become supply chain experts on the fly.\n\nA supply chain is a fancy term to describe how products get made and moved all around the globe. It\u2019s a simple concept, but not a simple process. Supply chains aren\u2019t a conveyor belt \u2014 they\u2019re a ballet. And there are many, many ways this spectacular show can fall flat on its face. The production of a single item often involves multiple factories in several different countries and depends on speedy, reliable international shipping to get each piece to the right place at the right time \u2014 and then to the buyers exactly when they need it.\n\nIn fact, experts in both manufacturing and medicine have spent years warning of the risks a pandemic \u2014 or another major disaster \u2014 could cause to supply chains. In 2011, for instance, Quilty documented that the hospital where he worked at the time had less than a 30 days\u2019 supply of penicillin and many other crucial pharmaceutical drugs. A 2017 paper by scientists with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that PPE supplies had run into problems during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic, and warned that the system wasn\u2019t prepared to handle a sudden increase in demand. Multiple reports have been published on how avian flu pandemics could disrupt everything from computer manufacturing to the global food supply.\n\n\u201cPPE is the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Ranney said. She, and other experts, told me that right now, that\u2019s the main place we\u2019re seeing supply chains break down. But those same issues apply to damn near everything else we make and sell. The longer the pandemic goes on, the more products will be affected.\n\nThere are three big problems with the global supply chains, experts told me. First, the push toward lowest-cost production means a lot of cheap goods and cheap components of more valuable goods are made in places with low-cost labor. When those countries experience a pandemic outbreak \u2014 or when a pandemic interrupts transport from those countries \u2014 it creates a bottleneck.\n\nAround half the world\u2019s face masks came from China before the novel coronavirus pandemic began. The virus interrupted manufacturing there early on, Ranney said. Now, China can make masks again, but demand has jumped all over the world, and there are shipping delays. Several companies have told her to expect deliveries to take three or four weeks. In the meantime, she\u2019s been left to sort through sketchy, back-alley PPE dealers, some of whom produce low-quality masks that either fall apart or don\u2019t filter properly on testing. Other would-be suppliers have turned out to be basically the high-stakes equivalent of one of those \u201cyou\u2019ve inherited $3,000,000!\u201d email scams.\n\nAmerican manufacturing companies are starting to switch over production lines to make masks and other protective equipment here \u2014 but that\u2019s not a quick process and presents its own complications. For example, the nonwoven textiles that N95 respirator masks use to filter out viruses have to be made on special machines. There are only a few of those machines in the whole world, said Julie Swann, professor of industrial and systems engineering at North Carolina State University. And you can\u2019t just go buy a new one off the shelf. Her university is producing some of this material now. \u201cBut not at the volume you\u2019d make at a large manufacturer,\u201d she said.\n\nThe second problem is that a global pandemic causes sudden spikes in demand for certain products. Production is designed for steady demand with predictable increases and decreases. A big, unforeseen event, like a pandemic, throws everything out of whack, said Adegoke Oke, professor of supply chain management at Arizona State University\u2019s school of business. Take our toilet paper woes. That supply chain didn\u2019t account for sudden, nationwide increases in having to pee at home. It also didn\u2019t anticipate every office in the nation suddenly holding it, indefinitely. You might think that the demand in one sector could be met by the excess from the other, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. \u201cThe type of toilet paper you use in the office \u2014 the big rolls \u2014 are totally different from what you use at home,\u201d Oke said. \u201cThey require different supply chains and different manufacturing lines.\u201d\n\nAnd when manufacturing capacity can\u2019t keep up with a sudden surge in demand, there are no emergency backup supply closets to raid. That\u2019s because of a popular and widespread business practice called \u201cjust in time\u201d supply. Essentially, it means that businesses from hospitals to grocery stores keep only a small amount of supplies on hand at any given time \u2014 enough to get through a couple of weeks or a month. Just-in-time saves money on warehouse storage, energy and staffing, but it works only if the supplies can be produced and delivered when you need them. \u201cIt\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Oke said. \u201cBut at a time like this, the last thing you want is just-in-time.\u201d\n\nFinally, supply chains are also getting disrupted in some truly surprising ways \u2014 ripple effects that spread from one industry to another. Take the transportation of goods. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty dependent on European tourism \u2014 80 percent of the air cargo capacity across the Atlantic comes aboard passenger flights. When those all but stopped, it created a transportation bottleneck for manufacturing, said James Robinson, an independent consultant who spent 30 years working in vaccine manufacturing for companies like Merck. Airlines are turning their empty passenger jets into cargo flights, but that takes retrofitting and time and money \u2014 and it\u2019s going to increase the cost of shipping, Robinson said.\n\nThen there\u2019s all the food being trashed in response to a pandemic that\u2019s cleared grocery shelves nationwide. The same parallel but separate home and business supply chains that affect the toilet paper supply also affect food. What people eat in a restaurant or at school \u2014 and how much of it they eat \u2014 isn\u2019t the same as what they eat at home. And the farmers who have typically supplied commercial kitchens don\u2019t have the sales, marketing, packaging and transport networks in place to get their food where it\u2019s needed. Fresh vegetables and milk have simply been thrown out. And that\u2019s not to mention facilities\u2019 closing when food industry workers are taken out by illness or migrant farm workers\u2019 not being able to cross borders at future harvest times \u2014 things that researchers have long predicted could cause food shortages in the U.S. during a time of pandemic. \u201cThe food supply could be vulnerable,\u201d Swann said. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want to scare people.\u201d\n\nThese supply chain issues can also create a weird sort of feedback loop: The virus increases demand for certain products, which jumbles supply chains for those products, which in turn hampers efforts to use those products to keep the virus in check. And that gives the virus time to beat up the economy even more.\n\nWhich is all to say that problems with the PPE supply could be only the beginning. As people like Robinson try to coordinate what will become an international effort to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine in the months ahead, for example, they\u2019re looking at what\u2019s going on with products like PPE \u2014 knowing that the same things could happen to vaccines.\n\n\u201cA vaccine manufacturer like Sanofi might source several thousand ingredients to make a vaccine,\u201d Robinson told me. \u201cBut each material is coming from factories with hundreds of sources, and those sources have sources.\u201d Like the connection between holiday travel and international shipping, supply chains for vaccines can end in unexpected places \u2014 like a Chilean tree farm.\n\nRobinson is vice chair of the scientific advisory committee for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an international organization that helps coordinate funding and research for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. CEPI is involved in the development of 10 different coronavirus vaccines, and Robinson expects at least three of those will eventually make it to widespread use. One of these vaccines, though, uses an adjuvant \u2014 a substance to help strengthen the body\u2019s immune response to a vaccine \u2014 that contains an oil extracted from the Quillaja saponaria Molina tree, common to Peru, Chile and Bolivia. The bark is harvested only between November and January each year, so this year\u2019s harvest didn\u2019t take the new coronavirus into account. There\u2019s only so much of that adjuvant available until next year, Robinson said.\n\nOther expected supply chain issues with vaccines are shaped by years of international trade patterns. For example, doses of vaccines are delivered in glass vials, and there\u2019s been a global shortage of glass stretching back to at least 2015. The medical glass industry was just beginning to catch up with increased demand, Robinson said, and now, novel coronavirus vaccines will create additional pressure. Even if the vaccine is loaded into 10-dose vials, that\u2019s still hundreds of millions of vials that will be needed, he told me. Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a novel coronavirus vaccine that Robinson regards as one of the most promising. \u201c[Janssen has] already preordered 250 million vials, and that might be all that\u2019s out there,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to procure another 200 million.\u201d\n\nWhat it boils down to is that even the vaccine industry isn\u2019t prepared for a sudden increase in demand on this scale \u2014 which would likely far outpace even the spikes associated with a bad flu season. \u201cIn 2009, H1N1 rapidly increased manufacturing and got up to 400 million doses in a year. But for a pandemic, we might need billions,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nThe biggest thing experts are taking away from all this is the weakness of that just-in-time supply chain. \u201cIn lean terminology, inventory is waste because it\u2019s supply you aren\u2019t using,\u201d Robinson said. But now, when demand is sharply rising, that inventory would be helpful \u2014 and so many industries are tied together that when one runs out of supply it affects the ability of other industries to keep functioning.\n\nProduction can be ramped up, and it is. But it takes time and investment \u2014 and it\u2019s important to remember that those investments are a risk. We might need American-made masks now, but will we keep buying them after the threat of COVID-19 has passed? Or will we revert to just-in-time supply from cheaper factories overseas? History suggests the latter. During previous epidemics of influenza, Texas-based company Prestige Ameritech saw demand soar, Swann told me. But it proved to be a boom and bust. The company invested in new machines to meet demand during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Swann said. \u201cAnd then they almost went out of business later because [the Texas company\u2019s product] was a little more expensive than the ones from China,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be willing to pay a little more during times of peace without crisis so we have supply available during crisis.\u201d", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/she-was-about-to-start-a-new-job-then-the-economy-collapsed/", "published": "2020-04-13T13:00:33", "title": "She Was About To Start A New Job.

To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nJust over a month ago, things were looking pretty rosy for Laura Buda. After an eight-year run at a midsize arts company, the 32-year-old marketing and communications specialist from Virginia was offered \u2014 and had accepted \u2014 a new job with a much larger organization.\n\nThe new gig would provide not only greater upward mobility for the future but also a higher salary for the present. To celebrate the change, Buda and her husband went on a brief getaway to the Blue Ridge Mountains during the 10-day gap between the final day of her previous job and the first day of her new one.\n\nBut during that hiatus in mid-March, the new coronavirus began spreading aggressively throughout America. Like everyone else, Buda saw schools and businesses shutting their doors in response. And like many other Americans, she began wondering how COVID-19 might affect her new job. Perhaps they\u2019ll push back my start date by a week, she thought, or if things get really bad, maybe a month.\n\nThen, late in the afternoon on Friday, March 20 \u2014 three days before she was slated to begin her new position \u2014 she got a phone call. A member of the company\u2019s human resources department apologized profusely but said that the organization was being forced to rescind Buda\u2019s offer because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus.\n\nBuda is part of a gray area within the nation\u2019s reeling economy: those who left one job voluntarily for another \u2014 before COVID-19 spread and altered nearly everything in its path \u2014 but who never technically started working at the second gig. People like her are left in the lurch, not knowing whether they\u2019ll ultimately be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.\n\nBuda\u2019s husband, who works as an attorney for the federal government, read through the unemployment stipulations carefully and told her he wasn\u2019t sure that her unique circumstances would qualify. \u201cThey ask you to list your last job, and I had to say that I left voluntarily,\u201d said Buda, still waiting to hear back about her filing. \u201cThere\u2019s a small area there to explain your circumstances a little more. But with how many people are filing for unemployment, I\u2019m not even totally sure that part will be read through closely.\u201d\n\nIf she ends up qualifying for unemployment, she estimates that it would amount to about $1,600 per month \u2014 a little bit less than what she and her husband had been paying in child care costs for their 16-month-old son, Dominic.\n\nThere have been some silver linings for Buda and her family, however. Her son\u2019s child care facility \u2014 which has continued to operate during the pandemic \u2014 has allowed parents to pull their children out of day care without having to pay during the crisis. (Some don\u2019t allow that.) And the recent coronavirus relief legislation lets some people with federal student loans temporarily halt their payments, which will save Buda about $450 a month. Perhaps most important: Buda\u2019s husband earns enough to support the family single-handedly. But they will still need to tighten their belts to get through this period.\n\nThe past four weeks have been a whirlwind for Buda. Not long ago, she had planned to buy clothes for the new job \u2014 something her bump in pay would have comfortably allowed. But now she counts it as a blessing that she never took that step. Instead of learning the ropes at her new gig, she spends her spare time \u2014 the time her toddler allows her to have \u2014 sifting through emails notifying her of openings she might be a match for.\n\n\u201cAnytime I\u2019m on the computer, [Dominic] wants to push all the buttons,\u201d she said.\n\nBuda vacillates between looking for jobs and thinking it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand, given the state of the economy. She would love to find something in theater, a field she\u2019d worked in for a long time. But she\u2019s also looking for jobs at nonprofits; she thinks positions with organizations that are untethered to the marketplace seem far more stable now and over the long haul.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people who work in industries that, when things reopen, things aren\u2019t going to go back to normal,\u201d Buda said. \u201cIn theater, people aren\u2019t going to want to engage right away, even if it\u2019s deemed safe. I just think the recovery is going to be so much harder for something like that.\u201d\n\nCheck out all the latest coronavirus polling we\u2019ve collected.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-than-16-million-americans-have-lost-their-jobs-in-the-past-three-weeks/", "published": "2020-04-09T14:17:54", "title": "More Than 16 Million Americans Have Lost Their Jobs In The Past Three Weeks", "text": "The coronavirus\u2019s record-breaking run of bad economic news continues unabated. Thursday\u2019s numbers from the Department of Labor reported that 6.6 million Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance, roughly the same as last week (which was revised to 6.9 million) and about double the previous week\u2019s tally of 3.3 million.\n\nAdd it up, and over the course of three weeks, a total of 16.8 million seasonally adjusted unemployment claims have been filed. If we borrow the math from this Justin Wolfers piece in The New York Times last week, that means somewhere around 15 to 17 percent of the workforce might currently be without a job. (For comparison\u2019s sake, that number was 25 percent at the height of the Great Depression.)\n\nThe U.S. has had eight recessions since 1967, including the one we are almost certainly in right now. Of those, four (1969-70, 1980, 1990-91 and 2001) never reached our current level, over 16 million unemployment claims. For the others, it took a tremendous amount of time to reach that level: between 33 weeks (1981-82) and 51 (1973-75). Even in the Great Recession a decade ago, it took 42 weeks to get 16 million total initial claims. This time around, it has taken three.\n\nThis recession is moving at hyperspeed For U.S. recessions since 1967, number of weeks before reaching each benchmark for total initial unemployment insurance claims Weeks before no. of total initial claims Recession of \u2026 3,000,000 9,000,000 16,000,000 1969-70 13 33 Never 1973-75 11 31 51 1980 8 19 Never 1981-82 7 20 33 1990-91 8 22 Never 2001 8 23 Never 2007-09 9 26 42 2020* 1 2 3 *The current economic downturn hasn\u2019t yet met the traditional definition of a recession. Previous recessions were considered to have started midway through the month they officially began and ended midway through the month they finished. Sources: Department of Labor, St. Louis Federal Reserve, National Bureau of Economic Research\n\nNow, it\u2019s important to remember that the U.S. population has also increased by 66 percent since 1967, meaning there are more workers to potentially file claims now. Furthermore, total initial claims are not equivalent to the number of people who are actually receiving unemployment benefits. And, of course, economists look at much more than just unemployment when determining whether a recession has happened.\n\nThat said, the sheer job-loss numbers for this recession \u2014 and the velocity at which they were amassed \u2014 are difficult to comprehend.\n\nGoing back to previous recessions, some analysts see parallels to the 1981-82 downturn. That recession is considered to have been triggered by changes in monetary policy, when former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation. By comparison, this recession was triggered by widespread stay-at-home orders that effectively shuttered countless businesses and put millions out of work. (We should note that economists almost unanimously agree that this was the best decision not only for public health reasons but also for the long-term economy.) Many jobs were lost in the early 1980s, but the unemployment rate quickly dropped after the initial shock, which may provide a model for people to return to work swiftly after the coronavirus crisis lifts.\n\nAgain, though, that early 1980s recession took much longer to reach present levels of jobless claims, so in many ways our current recession represents an unprecedented situation. That\u2019s particularly true when you consider the underlying reason why people can\u2019t go back to work \u2014 a novel virus for which a vaccine is still quite far off \u2014 and the uncertainty around what its eventual timeline will end up being. One thing is for sure, however: Most of us have never seen a recession produce such extreme economic hardship, so quickly, as what the U.S. is going through right now.", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/media-coverage-doesnt-actually-determine-public-opinion-on-the-economy/", "published": "2020-04-08T11:00:15", "title": "Media Coverage Doesn\u2019t Actually Determine Public Opinion On The Economy", "text": "In mid-February, Wall Street was celebrating the stock market reaching record highs. But the stock market has since lost roughly 20 percent of its value in the wake of the coronavirus, and the broader economy is in freefall as well. A record number of Americans have filed for unemployment benefits, and the March jobs report found the economy had lost 700,000 jobs \u2014 the first time that number has declined in a decade.\n\nBut even though large swaths of the economy have shuttered with extraordinary speed, this economic downturn is likely to hit some people and places much harder than others. Those disparate effects, in turn, raise a question that is critical for politics as well as economics: In a country as large and diverse as the U.S., how do citizens know whether the economy is doing better or worse?\n\nOne obvious source of information is the news media. In fact, some political scientists have found that negative news coverage of the economy can shape public opinion, especially in an election year. Marc Hetherington, for instance, found that media coverage in the run-up to the 1992 presidential election was more negative than the economy warranted and cost incumbent President George H.W. Bush support. That could be particularly telling now, considering this is all happening just months ahead of a presidential election, and a strong economy has historically boosted the incumbent president\u2019s chances of winning reelection.\n\nBut in a 2017 \u201cResearch & Politics\u201d article, Eunji Kim, Soojong Kim and I found that the news media\u2019s ability to influence Americans\u2019 perceptions of the economy may be overstated. Our analysis found that major media outlets\u2019 coverage of the economy is much more likely to lag public perceptions than to lead them. That means that the media coverage of an economic recession, like the one we seem to be headed toward, isn\u2019t independently reshaping how Americans think the economy is doing. Instead, we found that media coverage often follows public opinion.\n\nWe used nearly 40 years of data from the University of Michigan\u2019s surveys of consumers, a long-running survey that asks Americans their views of the economy, to create a monthly index of Americans\u2019 level of concern about the economy. We then compared that index to a measure of how 24 different media outlets covered the economy during that same time period, including big national newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post as well as regional papers like the Houston Chronicle. Systematically measuring media outlets\u2019 coverage in nearly half a million newspaper articles and television transcripts proved a bit more challenging. But similar to our approach with the economic survey data, we created an index, this time using words associated with positive or negative economies \u2014 words like \u201cbear,\u201d \u201cdrop,\u201d \u201cjobless,\u201d and \u201clayoff,\u201d as well as \u201cbull,\u201d \u201cgrowth,\u201d and \u201cinvest\u201d \u2014 to score the tone of economic stories published by these outlets.\n\nAnd if we drill down into one of the most prominent media outlets we analyzed, The New York Times, we find no indication that media coverage is shaping public opinion. A telltale sign of media influence would have been if the tone of the Times\u2019s economic coverage shifted before public perception does. But as you can see in the chart below, that didn\u2019t really happen. Instead, the public\u2019s perceptions of the economy more often seemed to lead news coverage rather than lag behind it. For instance, during key moments such as in the run-up to the Great Recession in 2008, the public grew more pessimistic well before the Times\u2019s tone shifted.\n\nIn fact, this was the case across the 24 media outlets we analyzed. There were some outlets for which we found that the tone of media coverage consistently led public perceptions of the economy, but overall, we found no strong evidence that media coverage pushed Americans as a whole to perceive the economy in one way or the other.\n\nGiven how much attention politicians devote to the tone of media coverage, these results may seem surprising. But we\u2019re actually not the only researchers to conclude that public perceptions aren\u2019t heavily influenced by how the media frames the economy. H. Brandon Haller and Helmut Norpoth, for instance, found that citizens\u2019 perceptions of the economy didn\u2019t vary much based on their news consumption habits.\n\nStill, other studies find evidence that the influence can run in both directions, with the tone of media coverage sometimes anticipating public perceptions. For example, Stuart Soroka, Dominik Stecula and Christopher Wlezien found that public perceptions can anticipate media coverage, but also that media coverage can actually lead public perceptions of how the economy has performed but not perceptions of how it will perform. After examining the tone of economic coverage in the four highest-circulation national newspapers, though, Amber Boydstun, Benjamin Highton, and Suzanna Linn conclude that media coverage can predict how Americans view the economy even after accounting for the state of the economy itself.\n\nOn two key points, then, academic research has been consistent: Public perceptions of the economy can get out ahead of media coverage, and public perceptions are also closely connected to actual economic conditions. This suggests that there are critical limits to the media\u2019s influence on public perceptions, which is consistent with other research that shows the impact of elite opinion is often overstated.\n\nIn other words, when the economy shifts directions, the news media\u2019s capacity to reshape public perceptions of the economy is limited at best. It\u2019s easy to pick up a newspaper and assume that its writers and editors can shape public opinion, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be true of the economy. Rather, the public reacts to real-world economic conditions, not media spin.\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Dan Hopkins"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-social-safety-net-wasnt-ready-for-the-coronavirus-crisis/", "published": "2020-04-08T10:00:03", "title": "America\u2019s Social Safety Net Wasn\u2019t Ready For The Coronavirus Crisis", "text": "The coronavirus crisis is testing almost every facet of American life, including the country\u2019s social safety net.

Congress just injected $260 billion into the state unemployment insurance system, and most Americans will eventually receive $1,200 relief payments. Because of the way our unemployment insurance system is set up, many Americans are still struggling to file unemployment claims, and the amount of government assistance they\u2019ll receive will also depend on where they live.

She thought it was her husband, Josh Frank, an urban designer who co-owns a landscape architecture and urban design firm, who had the unstable job. But soon after Florida public schools began to close and their county rolled out social-distancing ordinances, Meach\u2019s boss announced that the clinic where she works would be closing its doors for the foreseeable future. She and all her co-workers were laid off indefinitely.\n\nMeach was stunned \u2014 and unprepared. \u201cI always thought my job was recession-proof,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I went from being extraordinarily busy to unemployed in less than a week.\u201d She and Frank had bought a house three months earlier, so she was immediately concerned about how they would pay the mortgage \u2014 much less their student debt. That concern morphed into panic when she began to investigate Florida\u2019s unemployment insurance system and found that the state would pay only up to $275 per week in benefits, just a fraction of what she had been making at her job.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is putting a lot of pressure on the unemployment system and exposing the dramatic variations in states\u2019 relative generosity or stinginess with benefits. The federal government is attempting to standardize how much money people like Meach will receive by tacking an additional $600 per week onto every unemployed person\u2019s benefits for the next four months. But because of steps that some states like Florida have taken to restrict their unemployment insurance program, government aid to jobless workers will still be distributed unevenly.\n\nIn the wake of the Great Recession, Florida was among the states that created a complex patchwork of requirements for jobless workers. The state also capped benefits at 12 weeks \u2014 far below the national standard of 26 weeks. As a result, the share of unemployed workers receiving benefits in Florida and several other states with similar restrictions fell precipitously. In 2019, only 11.3 percent of the out-of-work population in Florida was receiving benefits, down from 30 percent in 2007. That recipiency rate \u2014 the share of unemployed people who actually receive benefits \u2014 is far below the 50 percent experts told us is typical during normal times, although that share usually rises during recessions.\n\nMany of the most burdensome restrictions have now been lifted in response to the coronavirus crisis, which means it should be easier for workers to receive benefits. And in fairness to Florida, states that were distributing benefits to a bigger share of unemployed workers were also unprepared for the recent influx of claims. But even with the additional $600 per week, jobless Floridians will still be getting far smaller payouts than workers in other states, where the maximum payments can be two or three times higher. And that\u2019s assuming the money makes it into their wallets anytime soon. Hours after Meach was laid off, she went online to submit her application to get unemployment benefits, only to be confronted by an antiquated and labyrinthine system online. \u201cYou can\u2019t refresh or you\u2019ll lose all your progress,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me about three hours to figure out where to upload my resume.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, she and Frank have scrambled to find other sources of income. He picked up some shifts taking calls and doing administrative work at his father\u2019s small business, while Meach grabbed a few extra hours as a remote lecturer. They also took advantage of their bank\u2019s offer to defer their mortgage payments. Meach finally got her unemployment application submitted by logging onto the website in the early morning, more than a week after she lost her job. By some measures, she was lucky \u2014 Florida\u2019s online system has been functioning so poorly that the state director of unemployment announced last week that his office will start issuing paper applications for jobless workers to mail in.\n\nBut Meach doesn\u2019t feel especially victorious, because she still has no idea when she\u2019ll actually get the money. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot to try to make things work financially,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the unemployment benefits are a big piece of the puzzle for us, so it\u2019s very stressful to wonder when and if that\u2019s going to come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat $1,200 would have given me another month of breathing room.\u201d\n\nThe bad news started for Chloe Carter-Daves, 21, when she lost her part-time job at a restaurant in New York City in mid-March. It continued when \u2014 after weeks of daily attempts \u2014 she still wasn\u2019t able to submit a claim for unemployment insurance. And it culminated in the discovery that because she\u2019s a student, she won\u2019t be receiving a $1,200 relief check from the federal government like most Americans, even though she\u2019s been supporting herself without help from her parents over the past few years.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans will receive a payment from the federal government over the coming weeks. But college students (and some high school students) fall into a kind of no man\u2019s land: They often don\u2019t file their own tax returns, even if they\u2019re basically self-sufficient, which means they won\u2019t qualify for the relief checks. And their families won\u2019t receive a child payment for them either since they\u2019re over the age of 16.\n\nFor some students who are living at home, that might not be such a burden. But Carter-Daves, a senior at Hunter College, stayed in her off-campus apartment, which means she\u2019s still paying for her own rent and groceries. \u201cI\u2019ll be real \u2014 even when I was working, I was living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d she said. \u201cThat $1,200 would have given me another month of breathing room.\u201d\n\nCutting most college students out of the relief payments could turn out to be a particularly big oversight because young workers are at an especially high risk of losing their jobs right now. As Ryan Best and I wrote on March 18, workers under age 25 are disproportionately more likely to lack both paid sick leave and the ability to work from home. Younger workers are also especially likely to work in the service and retail sales industries \u2014 which have both been among the hardest-hit sectors of the economy.\n\nIf Carter-Daves can get her unemployment insurance claim through, she says she should be OK financially, at least for a while. Her home state of New York has fairly generous benefits for jobless workers. But it was unprepared for the recent tsunami of unemployment claims in a different way. A Department of Labor report from February named New York among six states whose unemployment systems don\u2019t have enough money in their reserves to handle a normal recession. And, so far, the federal government hasn\u2019t taken steps to bail out cash-strapped state and local governments, which means that big states like New York and California are at risk of quickly burning through their unemployment insurance funds.\n\nBut more than two weeks after Carter-Daves lost her job, the website seemed to have become even less functional. \u201cFor a while, the issue was that I would start my application, get halfway through, and then the website would crash,\u201d she said. \u201cNow when I log in, there\u2019s no more option to file a claim.\u201d She\u2019s far from the only New Yorker for whom wrestling with the unemployment insurance website has become a full-time job \u2014 last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo apologized for the site\u2019s frequent crashes and said the state was working on fixing the problems.\n\nIn the meantime, Carter-Daves applied for an emergency assistance grant from her school and got enough money to cover her April rent. But she\u2019s already worried about future bills \u2014 particularly since, as a college senior, she\u2019s facing the dismal prospect of graduating into a frozen economy. \u201cI was planning on leaving the service industry once I graduated,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I think I\u2019m going to be grateful if I have any income at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe help is great, but I don\u2019t know if it will get to me in time.\u201d\n\nBefore the coronavirus crisis hit, Rebekah Guerra, 26, was already living on a shoestring budget in Los Angeles County. Faced with a mountain of student and medical debt, she moved back in with her parents last year while she tried to jump-start her business as a freelance marketing professional. But over the course of a few weeks in March, any semblance of financial stability evaporated. \u201cI work with a lot of smaller businesses, and they\u2019ve either closed their doors entirely or marketing is not their focus,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t really blame them \u2014 what is there to market if they have no business? But it means my work has completely gone away too.\u201d\n\nUp until recently, freelancers and independent contractors like Guerra were left out of the social safety net for jobless workers, since they don\u2019t usually qualify for unemployment insurance. That changed with the new bill passed by Congress, which created a new emergency unemployment program to cover them. But it could be complicated for states that are already swamped with claims to set up a new infrastructure to funnel funds to freelancers, whose incomes will be harder to verify. There are also questions about which freelancers will qualify, since according to new guidance from the federal government, people who can telework with pay are ineligible \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear what that will mean for people like Guerra, who are theoretically able to work from home but have lost all their business. Experts estimate that it could be weeks before the payments are actually distributed.\n\nAnd for Guerra, any delay could bring her closer to financial catastrophe. She has a chronic health condition that requires her to spend hundreds of dollars a month on medication. And she struggled to pay for her health insurance premium at the beginning of the month. \u201cI\u2019m reassessing my budget \u2014 giving up subscriptions, thinking about things like whether I can go to a lower level of coverage on my car insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nAll of this means that, to Guerra, the prospect of receiving government benefits \u2014 through unemployment insurance or a stimulus check \u2014 feels tantalizing but remote. \u201cThe help is great, but I don\u2019t know if it will get to me in time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I had a financial buffer before this. I understand the system is overloaded and I want to be patient, but my bills are coming due now.\u201d\n\nWhy it\u2019s so hard to make a good COVID-19 model", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-economy-still-the-most-important-thing-for-trumps-reelection/", "published": "2020-04-06T18:07:12", "title": "Is The Economy Still The Most Important Thing For Trump\u2019s Reelection?", "text": "The U.S. economy lost 700,000 jobs in March, while more than 10 million Americans filed unemployment claims. The economy is tumbling in the wake of the coronavirus, and now there\u2019s a very real possibility that we\u2019re on the verge of a recession.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know \u2014 including the severity and the length of the downturn we currently find ourselves in \u2014 but the economic outlook in the next few months could play an outsized role in President Trump\u2019s reelection chances this November. It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint how the economy might matter this time around, but historically, economic conditions have been of consequence in presidential elections. However, that might be less true now, given how increasingly polarized and partisan American politics are.\n\nFor a long time now, political science has found a positive relationship between consumer sentiment and a president\u2019s approval rating. That is, the more optimistic Americans are about the economy, the higher a president\u2019s approval tends to be. But now there are signs that is no longer the case. Trump\u2019s approval rating, for instance, doesn\u2019t really track with views of the economy \u2014 it\u2019s lower than you\u2019d expect. The same disconnect was true during former President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, leaving some political scientists to conclude partisan loyalties might now be more important than anything else \u2014 even the strength of the economy \u2014 in evaluating presidential performance.\n\nConsider Trump\u2019s incredibly steady approval rating. Despite plenty of drama \u2014 remember impeachment? \u2014 his approval rating has barely budged. In fact, he has the steadiest presidential approval rating of any president since World War II. Trump\u2019s approval rating has generally fallen within a very narrow 5-point band, hovering between 40 percent and 45 percent. Obama is the only other president with a similarly narrow range \u2014 his approval rating fell between 45 and 50 percent about half of the time.\n\nMuch of what we\u2019re seeing here can be explained by ever-increasing partisan polarization. In fact, the growing divide between Republicans and Democrats is larger than at any other point in the last two decades, according to the Pew Research Center. Practically, what this has meant that a president like Trump gets sky-high ratings from Republicans (Gallup found 89 percent approved of him over the past year) and incredibly low ratings from Democrats (7 percent). Even a good economy doesn\u2019t move the needle as much because partisanship also increasingly influences how people judge economic conditions. For instance, Pew found earlier this year that 57 percent of Americans rated the economy as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood,\u201d but 81 percent of Republicans answered that way compared to just 39 percent of Democrats.\n\nChristopher Wlezien, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies how economic conditions influence presidential elections, told me that on average, elections tend to be \u201croughly half economics and half other stuff,\u201d but that may not be the case for Trump. \u201cGiven where his approval ratings are, where his poll performance is and where the economy has been, a lot of what\u2019s going on here is non-economic,\u201d Wlezien said, adding that strong partisanship is undoubtedly part of it. \u201cThe stronger [people] identify with parties, the less things like economic factors matter,\u201d Wlezien said.\n\nThat said, Trump has generally scored better on the economy than on other issues during his time in office, but similar to Obama, he hasn\u2019t really enjoyed a boost in his approval ratings despite overseeing \u2014 until very recently \u2014 the longest period of economic expansion in U.S. history.\n\nBut even though views of the economy are filtered through partisan views, we have recently seen that they aren\u2019t completely immune to bad news. The latest poll from The Economist/YouGov found that the share of Republicans who felt the economy was getting better had fallen 32 points, from 70 percent in early March to 38 percent. Only 7 percent of Democrats said it was getting better. That was in line with previous polls, but the drop in Republican expectations of the economy could be a bad omen for Trump. If Republicans\u2019 economic expectations sour enough, some of them might disapprove of Trump despite partisan attachments to him.\n\nYet it might not be as bad as it might seem for Trump, as it\u2019s possible that perceptions about the prospects for recovery will be more important than the current downturn. The media tends to focus more on the economy\u2019s future anyway and less on current economic conditions. So if the economy seems headed toward recovery after the worst of the crisis, that might play favorably in the court of public opinion. Not to mention, voters tend to take a more holistic view of the economy, accounting for as much as two years of past economic performance when voting in presidential contests \u2014 which could be good for Trump, as the economy had been pretty good for most of his time in office.\n\nNonetheless, the economy still might not be the most important factor in the November election: It could be primarily about Trump himself. \u201cAll the evidence seems to point to referendum judgments mattering a lot more when there\u2019s an incumbent than when there\u2019s not,\u201d Wlezien said. In fact, there is evidence that vote choice is unaffected by economic attitudes if an incumbent president is running. According to political science research, voter assessments of the economy are too closely linked to perceptions of the president and don\u2019t make that much of a difference, which, again, brings us back to partisanship and Trump\u2019s steady approval rating.\n\nIf there is evidence of economic recovery by the fall, the huge partisan gap in attitudes toward the economy may return to pre-crisis levels. And with that, the election might look much like it did only a few weeks ago: Democrats overwhelmingly supporting the Democratic nominee and Republicans overwhelmingly supporting Trump, with the economy not mattering much at all.", "author": ["Geoffrey Skelley"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-jobs-report-was-bad-the-next-one-will-be-worse/", "published": "2020-04-03T13:12:50", "title": "This Jobs Report Was Bad. The Next One Will Be Worse.", "text": "Well, it took 10 years, but the streak is over: There was a net loss of American jobs last month. That\u2019s putting it mildly, actually. Today, the first jobs report encompassing the economic fallout from COVID-19 was released and, predictably, it paints a dire picture. Overall, 701,000 fewer people are employed now than last month \u2014 the first time in a decade that number has declined. The unemployment rate \u2014 which has remained below 4 percent since January 2019 \u2014 has risen to 4.4 percent.\n\nBut this is just a glimpse of what\u2019s to come. Next month\u2019s report will almost certainly be far worse, and this month\u2019s will likely be revised down in the months to come.\n\nBut one thing we know with relative certainty: The situation will get worse before it gets better. The household survey, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to estimate the unemployment rate, was in the field the second week of March. While some businesses had already shut down temporarily by then, plenty of areas \u2014 some of the most populated areas, in fact \u2014 hadn\u2019t yet called for closures. Six counties in the Bay Area, for example, had yet to announce a shelter-in-place mandate, and New York Gov. Andrew Coumo had yet to \u201cput New York on pause,\u201d requiring all nonessential businesses to close down public-facing storefronts.\n\nSo, if you can, look beyond this month\u2019s job report and ask yourself: Just how bad will the next report be? And what will an economic recovery look like?\n\nUnemployment insurance claims, which are reported weekly, can help provide a sense of where we might be headed.\n\nAs the previous chart shows, there were 282,000 claims for the week the statistics bureau found an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent. After that, however, the number grew substantially. It stands to reason, then, that the true unemployment rate is much higher.\n\nOne piece of good news: Matt McDonald, a partner at the consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies who writes a monthly analysis of the jobs report, says we have reason to believe that job growth will be as dramatic as the fall. A typical economic recession\u2019s recovery takes a U shape. That is, job losses level off at the bottom for several months before the country eventually adds jobs again. He expects to see something closer to a V shape. \u201cI would guess that after the business closures get lifted, you\u2019re going to have a positive jobs report as a result of that \u2014 because you have to,\u201d McDonald said, citing the nature of businesses reopening all at once.\n\nIf the $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at helping those economically hurt by the coronavirus can offer enough leeway for businesses to wait this out, shops could rehire their staff as quickly as they let them go.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that the current stimulus packages will be enough, however. For any businesses running on thin margins, forgoing a few months of profit can be catastrophic. Even if they are financially equipped to do so, fear that the market will stay dicey might cause employers to act cautiously. \u201cYou\u2019ll have people moving into a defensive position in the economy, just assuming that this is going to be a longer fall,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cSo, you\u2019re going to have layoffs for that reason.\u201d\n\nBut, ultimately, we are still too far out to have any true grip on what kind of economic fallout we\u2019re facing. My former colleague Ben Casselman put it well on our politics podcast last week: \u201cWe\u2019re kind of flying blind here for a while in terms of the real impact of this. It\u2019s just faster than our economic data can keep up.\u201d", "author": ["Julia Wolfe"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/unemployment-filings-hit-6-6-million-doubling-last-weeks-record-high/", "published": "2020-04-02T13:13:47", "title": "Unemployment Filings Hit 6.6 Million, Doubling Last Week\u2019s Record High", "text": "Last week saw record-high unemployment numbers \u2014 an astronomical 3.3 million Americans filed initial claims between March 15 and March 21. But today\u2019s data from the Department of Labor painted a much, much bleaker picture for the job market. During the week ending on March 28, 6.6 million more people filed for unemployment insurance, double the number from last week and nearly 6 million more than the all-time high from before a week ago.\n\nMany of those claims were left over from a backlog of people unable to file during the initial wave of coronavirus-related layoffs. As we noted last week, state unemployment agencies have never needed to process anywhere near this many claims at once, and the strain was apparent in widespread reports that out-of-work Americans were struggling to file through computer glitches.\n\nBut this week\u2019s initial claims also reflect the ongoing vulnerability of American workers amid shelter-in-place orders and other social-distancing measures designed to slow the coronavirus\u2019s spread. According to research by economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, about 50 million jobs could eventually be lost due to the virus and the economic challenges it presents. These include jobs in sales, food preparation and other services, plus \u201chigh contact-intensive\u201d positions such as flight attendants and hairdressers.\n\nSo as the crisis wears on, initial unemployment claim numbers that once seemed unthinkable could become the norm.\n\n\u201cThese are very large numbers by historical standards,\u201d Faria-e-Castro wrote, \u201cbut this is a rather unique shock that is unlike any other experienced by the U.S. economy in the last 100 years.\u201d\n\nFaria-e-Castro did point out that the duration of this unemployment crisis also matters. And to that point, other economists have noted that a large number of these job losses could be erased once the virus clears and returning to work is feasible again \u2014 particularly since many of the unemployment claims are from workers who have been furloughed or only temporarily left unpaid.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC last week, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard predicted a boom in the overall economy once the pandemic subsides because of what he termed \u201cpent-up demand\u201d during the inactivity of social distancing. That would include, he said, a return to relatively normal unemployment numbers after the big spikes of this quarter.\n\nBut the simple truth is that experts \u2014 whether in economics or epidemiology \u2014 don\u2019t really know the ultimate trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly with regard to when cases will peak and tail off, a crucial factor for reopening the economy. It\u2019s an exceptionally difficult problem to model, as my colleagues Maggie Koerth, Laura Bronner and Jasmine Mithani wrote this week. And even if large numbers of the jobs lost this month are eventually restored, there\u2019s a good chance that this economic shock will still affect Americans\u2019 earnings for years to come, especially for recent graduates.\n\nFor now, that means economists will keep watching the unemployment figures as a way of gauging where we are in the crisis \u2014 and they\u2019ll keep readjusting their benchmarks to this new, never-seen-before normal.\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}]}, "nbpostgazette": {"rss": "http://nbpostgazette.com/feed/", "link": "http://http://nbpostgazette.com/", "articles": [{"link": "https://nbpostgazette.com/speedy-cash-payday-loan-service-reviews-pros-cons-verdict/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=speedy-cash-payday-loan-service-reviews-pros-cons-verdict", "published": "2020-05-05T04:40:30", "title": "Speedy Cash Payday Loan Service: Reviews, Pros, Cons & Verdict", "text": "Speedy cash is one of the leading payday loan providers in the US.

A year after the battle, a larger French force overcome Zaragoza at the Second Battle of Puebla, and Mexico City shortly fell to the intruders.\n\nIn the United States, Cinco de Mayo has taken on impact outside that in Mexico. More commonly celebrated in the United States than Mexico, the date has to turn out to be connected with the celebration of Mexican-American culture. These celebrations instigated in California, where they have been witnessed yearly since the year 1863.\n\nThe day extended the countrywide acceptance in the 1980s thanks particularly to advertising campaigns by beer and wine companies. In the present day, Cinco de Mayo produces beer sales on par with the Super Bowl.\n\nIn Mexico, the celebration of the battle carries on to be commonly ceremonial, such as through the battle re-enactments or through the military parades.

First, while significantly outnumbered, the Mexicans conquered a better-equipped French army. \u201cThis battle was significant in that the 4,000 Mexican soldiers were greatly outnumbered by the well-equipped French army of 8,000 that had not been defeated for almost 50 years.\u201d\n\nThe second reason is that, ever since the Battle of Puebla held, some have disputed over the topic that no country in the Americas has consequently been attacked by any other European military force. Historian Justo Sierra has also written in his Political Evolution of the Mexican People that on May 5, 1862, Mexico had not overcome the French in Puebla, France would have gone to the help of the Confederacy in the U.S. Civil War and the United States\u2019 fate would have been poles apart.\n\nThe holiday is extensively seen as a celebration of Mexican traditional heritage for America\u2019s developing Hispanic population.\n\nDoes All Of Mexican Celebrate Cinco De Mayo?\n\nNot really, as the people in Puebla only celebrate the day because that is where the unlikely victory was held, but the celebrations aren\u2019t countrywide.

This year in 2020, Cinco de Mayo is going to be celebrated on 5th May 2019, Sunday.\n\nCinco de Mayo History\n\nIn the year 1861, Benito Ju\u00e1rez, who was the lawyer as well as a member of the native Zapotec tribe, was then designated president of Mexico. At the time, the nation was in economic devastation after years of internal conflict, and the new president was forced to evasion on debt expenditures to European governments.\n\nIn response to that, France, Britain, and Spain sent the naval forces to Veracruz, Mexico, challenging recompense. Britain and Spain discussed with Mexico and removed their forces.\n\nFrance, on the other hand, ruled by Napoleon III, decided to use this chance to shape a territory out of the Mexican region. Late in the year 1861, a well-armed French navy captured Veracruz, landing a great force of troops and driving President Ju\u00e1rez and his government into departure.\n\nThe Battle of Puebla\n\nCertain that accomplishment would come quickly, 6,000 French troops under General Charles Latrille de Lorencez set out to outbreak Puebla de Los Angeles which was a small town in east-central Mexico. From his new head office in the north, Ju\u00e1rez curved up a disparate force of 2,000 loyal men\u2014a lot of them either native Mexicans or else of mixed heritage and were then sent to Puebla.\n\nThe massively outstripped and below-par supplied Mexicans, headed by Texas-born General Ignacio Zaragoza, encouraged the town and equipped for the French attack. On May 5, 1862, Lorencez assembled his army\u2014maintained by hefty weapons, before the city of Puebla and headed an attack.\n\nFacts about Cinco de Mayo\n\nCinco de Mayo celebrates the victory of the Mexican army over France at the Battle of Puebla on 5th May 1862.\n\nCinco de Mayo is sometimes mistaken for Mexico\u2019s Independence Day. The Independence Day of Mexico is celebrated every year on September 16 which is the most significant national holiday in Mexico, honouring the Cry of Dolores, which started the war of Mexican independence from Spain.\n\nNot all the Mexican celebrates the Cinco de Mayo, as the people in Puebla only celebrate the day. The reason behind it is that Puebla is the place where the unlikely victory was taken place, because of which the celebrations aren\u2019t countrywide. Cinco de Mayo is also not a federal holiday because of which the day is just like any other day for most people in Mexico.\n\nThe Battle of Puebla was a part of the Franco-Mexican War. One of the whys and wherefores it\u2019s so important is for the reason that the French army was much grander and more equipped than the Mexican army. They had more weapons and men at their disposal, but still after having all that the French lost the battle to Mexico.", "author": ["Prabhat Singh", "About The Author", "Prabhat Is A Consistent", "Hard Working Content Creator With Specialization In Tech", "Finance Niche.

This helicopter will be an autonomous spacecraft having a meter-long rotor whose size will be of a Chihuahua.\n\nAccording to the official information given by NASA, this machine will fly in the orbit of Mars 2020 rover. The main motive behind launching this helicopter is testing the technology that requires for flying a rotorcraft about 140 million miles away from the Earth.\n\nThere is an extensive amount of research involving resting & redesigning involved in developing a helicopter having the ability to work on the Red Planet. An interesting thing about Mar\u2019s atmosphere is that it is extremely thin that staying at one place only 10 feet above the ground is same as hovering 100,000 feet above the surface.\n\nThe maximum height at which helicopters operate on Earth is 40,000 as above this altitude there is not adequate density that can hold them.\n\nIn a news release, the Mars Helicopter project manager Mimi Aung state that our team had to scrutinize all the things so that the helicopter can fly at the minimal level of atmospheric density. She further states that they made it as light as possible without compromising with the power & solidity.\n\nThey have installed solar cells in the helicopter that will charge its lithium batteries. Additionally, there is an internal heating tool that makes sure it stays warm while passing Martian night where temperatures can reach to -100 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe light takes a minimum of 4 minutes and maximum of 30 minutes for light to pass from Mars to Earth. It depends on the position of planets in their orbits. The chances of operating the helicopter remotely can delay due to this. Instead, the commands should be received by the spacecraft from the Earth operations so that it can execute on their own.\n\nThere is a drill installed in this helicopter so that it can collect the rock samples, conduct chemical analysis and finding the life on Mars. As per the official information, this spacecraft will touch the Martian surface in February 2021.\n\nThere will be no harm to the Mars 2020 mission even if this mini helicopter fails. However, it will be a major setback for NASA who is looking to use rotorcraft as scouts in the future missions.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/10/video-small-satellites-marco-a-and-marco-b-take-pictures-of-earth-and-moon/", "published": "2020-05-10T09:10:17", "title": "Video: Small satellites Wall-E and Eve take pictures of Earth and Moon \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "A small satellite while going to Mars took some photos of the Earth and the moon. The Mars Cube one satellite which is named as MarCo was launched for its journey to the Mars along with the InSight Lander of NASA on May 5. This satellite took a picture of Earth and the moon on May 9 to prove that its high-gain antenna had started working correctly.\n\nAndy Klesh who is the chief engineer of Marco at the NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory which is located in Pasadena in California has said that it was a homage that was paid to Voyager. He further noted that the CubeSats have never traveled such a long distance in space before. So it is a big hurdle that these CubeSats are crossing. The scientists have confirmed that both CubeSats are working correctly and that they are quite confident that the CubeSats will travel even further.\n\nExcept for the similarity regarding the \u201cpale blue dot\u201d that is present in the photo, the two CubeSats which are named as the MarCO-A and MarCo-B (or Wall-E and Eve), are nowhere near the Voyager 1 in the year of 1990. This Voyager took a historic photo at a distance of 3.7 billion miles. However, the two CubeSats took the picture when they were 620,000 miles away from Earth.\n\nCubeSats are becoming very common within the earth\u2019s orbit. In this location, they tend to perform a variety of activities such as playing various technology tests, studying and taking pictures of land and so on. But this is the first time that such small CubeSats have made their journey so deep into space.\n\nMarCo-A and MarCo-B are invented in the JPL. They are actually on a mission to prove that satellites of such small version can also explore space to a considerable distance. They will also be responsible for testing few specific technologies such as a propulsion system that utilizes the similar cold, compressed gas which is commonly found in the fire extinguishers.\n\nIf everything goes according to the plan, then these CubeSats will be flying by Mars on 26th of Nov of this current year. On the same date, NASA\u2019s InSight Lander will also be reaching the Red Planet. Even the MarCo teams want the CubeSats to fetch data in respect of the EDL sequence of the Lander and after that transmit the data back to Earth.

Elon Musk is known as the CEO as well as the founder of the private space company, SpaceX. On this Sunday that is on the 13th of this month, he tweeted and stated that his company, SpaceX is said to conduct a total of 300 space missions within five years. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket was improved by receiving the upgraded Block 5 booster. This rocket which took off carrying Bangabandhu-1was launched at the Kennedy Space Centre of NASA.\n\nIn his tweet, Elon Musk stated that an about 30 to 40 rocket cores are to be built to accomplish 300 complete missions. The Falcon 9 rocket landed in a floating vessel or station in the Pacific Ocean after launching Bangabandhu-1. Elon said that after Falcon retires, Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) is to take over. The primary objective of BFR is to allow human beings to move quickly to other planets like the red planets and also to the moon. SpaceX is also aiming for reusability of rockets having the Block 5 booster.\n\nFalcon 9 was improved to be able to fly astronauts to the ISS which is the International Space Station. The first stages can be refurbished by engineers for more number of flights. The helium tanks have been improved in the new rockets as in the year 2016; an explosion occurred due to the rupture in the helium tank of the rocket.\n\nElon Musk is said to achieve the goal of exploring the red planet of Mars with the help of Big Falcon Rocket by the year 2022. This rocket will be built in Los Angeles\u2019s port. The LA Board of Harbor Commissioners has been permitted SpaceX to make this on the last island of the Los Angeles Port. The rocket is said to be built on the 19-acre land of the artificial reef. The building project is announced to give employment opportunities to about 700 people as stated by SpaceX. The rocket is said to have a length of 350 feet and will have a diameter of 30 feet.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/10/first-test-passed-by-the-biggest-parachute-ever-created-for-mars/", "published": "2020-05-10T07:10:11", "title": "First test passed by the biggest parachute ever created for Mars \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "The largest-ever parachute ExoMars that is scheduled to land on the surface of Mars in 2021 has passed its starting test. The weight of this parachute is 90 kilograms while its ring slot is 35 meters across. Additionally, it has 5 kilometers of cords.\n\nThe European Space Agency handles all the operations related to this project. As per the official released by this space agency, they have to work for five working days just for preparing & folding ExoMars into its right configuration.\n\nIn this test, the sample landing module weighing 500 KG was carried by helicopter to a height of approximately 4,000 feet from where it dropped. The deployment sequence of the parachute initiated after a 12-second free fall. The smaller pilot chute opened from here that trigged the opening of the main parachute. It takes 112 lines to connect the test landing module with the complete parachute system weighing 195 KG.\n\nAccording to the ExoMars engineer Stephane Langlois, the main motive of this process was to know the way the extraction of the parachute from the bag. Additionally, we were also looking to know about the parachute\u2019s first inflation. He further added that our team doesn\u2019t try to represent the atmosphere of Mars here. To do that, we have to go to a very higher that we have planned to perform in another test taking place later.\n\nThere are many GoPro cameras installed on the test module so that the deployment of two parachutes can monitor. According to researchers, technicians were getting telemetry data that will review along with the camera footage before moving on to the next test that will happen in the later part of the year.\n\nAlso, a video released by the ExoMars project manager Thierry Bancquaert where he said that it is a major milestone in this project as our ExoMars parachute has successfully deployed with the help of a tiny pilot chute without any damage.\n\nAnother statement released by the John Underwood, principal engineer of British contractor who created the parachute. He says that the complete system will carry by using a helium balloon in the upcoming test to a height of 17 miles. At this altitude, the atmosphere of Earth is same as of Mars.\n\nThe scheduled launch date of the ExoMars mission is July 2020 with a possible landing in March 2021.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/10/nasas-rxte-satellite-falls-to-earth-after-staying-in-space-for-23-years/", "published": "2020-05-10T06:10:10", "title": "Video: NASA\u2019s RXTE Satellite falls to Earth after staying in Space for 23 Years \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "One of NASA\u2019s satellites fell to earth on April 30. The satellite called Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite has been in space for over 20 years. NASA launched the RXTE satellite in December 1995 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. This satellite did not bear the name RXTE initially. NASA named the satellite XTE during the launching.\n\nIt was later named after an MIT astronomer called Bruno Rossi. Rossi pioneered the X-ray astronomy, he, unfortunately, died in 1993. The renaming of the satellite happened in 1996. The satellite did a lot of work observing the environment of black holes and neutron stars in X-ray wavelength during its service life.\n\nThe last time the satellite relayed a scientific observation was on January 4, 2012. The next day, NASA powered down the satellite. The satellite made a lot of observations that are outstanding contributions to scientific knowledge concerning black holes.\n\nThe RXTE satellite also made more observations on the neutron star called magnetar. Magnetar produces magnetic fields that are a thousand times stronger than the ones produced by normal neutron stars.\n\nThe satellite also observed that black holes of different masses produce x-ray activities of almost the same kind. The mission revealed several other observations that are still important. The RXTE mission has won five major awards for its contribution to the astronomical wealth of knowledge.\n\nThe awards include three Bruno Rossi awards. The mission won these awards in 1999, 2003, 2006, and 2009. The mission also earned the highest Dutch science award in 2004, the Spinoza award.\n\nNASA launched a successor to the RXTE mission in 2017. They named this mission Neutron Star Composition Explorer (NICER). The satellite placed at the skyward side of the International Space Station started studying variable x-ray sources.\n\nNASA expected that the RXTE satellite will burn out and fall to earth after the decommissioning of the satellite in 2012. The agency anticipated that the satellite would fall between 2014 and 2023. It was difficult to predict the exact time the satellite will fall to earth.\n\nSolar activity that affected the earth\u2019s atmosphere was not stable, and this made it difficult to make accurate predictions. At that time, NASA declared that the satellite had the potential of harming one out of thousand people should it crash to earth unexpectedly. The satellite did not hurt anyone when it fell to earth on April 30th.\n\nThe data collected by the satellite is available to the general public at NASA Goddard\u2019s High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/10/astronauts-ready-to-take-a-spacewalk-today/", "published": "2020-05-10T05:10:10", "title": "Watch live: ISS Astronauts take a spacewalk \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "Two astronauts who are aboard the International Space Station will walk in space today (May 16) outside the ISS. It is possible to watch the 6.5-hour spacewalk or what is known as the extravehicular activity online as well. The flight engineers of expedition 55 Drew Feustel, as well as Ricky Arnold, will come out of the station from the Quest airlock at about 8:10 am EDT. NASA is all set to make live coverage of the entire process starting around about 6:30 m EDT starting from the astronauts putting up their spacesuits and making the necessary arrangements.\n\nThe main aim for this spacewalk would be to upgrade the cooling system hardware of the station also they will try to install new communication equipment which will enhance the communication frequency level for the upcoming commercial crew spaceflights.\n\nAt the very beginning, they will be separating a component known as the Pump Flow Control Subassembly from the location of the spare parts to a position that will be within reach of the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator or popularly known as the \u201cDextre.\u201d It is a two-armed robot outside the station. On the other hand, the astronauts will shift a failed subassembly and move it to the spare parts zone. The moment the spacewalk is over the flight controllers who are present on the Earth will take the help of the robotic arm of Canadarm2 and also the robotic arm of Dextre and thereby install the brand new cooling system subassembly on the port-side truss of the ISS to check and monitoring.\n\nIf sufficient time remains for the spacewalkers, then they would go for the repairing of the camera system. It is fitted on the Destiny laboratory and will also try for the enhancement of the communication receiver for the betterment of the future commercial vehicles such as the Block 5 of the SpaceX or the Boeing\u2019s CST-100 and so on.\n\nFeustel will be making this spacewalk for the eighth time in his career while Arnold will be spacewalking for the fourth time in his career. Overall it is the 210th time that spacewalking is being conducted for maintenance, repairs for the ISS since the orbiting complex was first placed in the year of 1998. This will be the second time both of these astronauts are conducting a spacewalk together.

They also expect the satellites to be in service around the same period. The Chief Executive of Iridium, Matt Desch, revealed this in a conference call with reporters.\n\nHe said it is possible to put the satellites in their planned orbits within a short period because the company is now efficient at maneuvering satellites into the orbits they intended for them.\n\nIridium has already launched 50 next-generation satellites. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 was the launch vehicle for these satellites. Desch revealed that out of the fifty satellites already launched, forty-seven of them are in service and the other three are now moving into their planned orbits.\n\nThe company has scheduled the next launch for the 21st of this month. This date is a 2-days delay from the initial date, May 19th. The Falcon 9 will launch these satellites as well. Desch attributed the postponement to minor processing issues. He also said that he does not expect any further delay.\n\nThe launch will happen at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. During the previous launches, the Falcon 9 carried ten satellites on a single trip. Usually, the launch vehicle carries only Iridium satellites. However, the launch scheduled for May 21 is different; the Falcon 9 will carry on 5 Iridium satellites.\n\nThe satellites will have a companion; the GRACE-FO. The GRACE_FO is embarking on an earth science mission. This mission will continue the GRACE mission that ended in 2017 after fifteen years\u2019 service.\n\nThe GRACE-FO is a twin satellite, and they would work together. The upper stage of the Falcon 9 will deploy the twin satellites into one orbit before moving to a different orbit to deploy the Iridium satellites. After this launch, Iridium expects two other launches to complete the deployment of 100 next-generation satellites.\n\nAfter the May 21 launch, the next- generation satellites will have filled out three of the six of the six orbital planes. The expects to fill out the rest with the last two launches which are scheduled for July and the last quarter of the year.\n\nThese satellites will launch aboard the recently debuted Falcon 9 Block 5 launch vehicle. The vehicle launched a Bangladesh communication satellite called Bangabandhu-1 on its debut launch. This launch happened on May 11.

These satellites are named after the characters from the animated movie named Wall-E which was released in the year 2008. The spacecraft to Mars is titled Mars InSight lander, and it was launched from California last Sunday that is on the 6th of this month. The lander was launched with both the small satellites named EVER and Wall-E on a rocket named Atlas V. These satellites are the same size as a cereal box of a briefcase. After the rocket took off and reached into the outer space, the twin satellites got detached from the rocket in the upper stage of it. After getting separated, these followed the InSight Mars Lander to the Mars. The launching of these CubeSats that is cube-shaped satellites are said to have traveled through deeper space. These satellites are supposed to move a total of 485 million kilometers that is 300 million miles for about six months. This experiment of sending CubeSats to Mars alongside a spacecraft has a cost of $18.5 million.\n\nThe launching of the CubeSats, Wall-E and Eve is said to be beneficial in many ways. The thought about launching such satellites to Mars has been discussed for a very long time. The orbit of the red planet is said to be accessed very easily to students as well as the researchers. CubeSats have only been confined to the realm of the earth, so this will be the very first time that these CubeSats will be traveling to another planet\u2019s orbit. This project of NASA is known as MarCo. These CubeSats are made with cold gas or the gas found in fire extinguishers. They will move through space with the help of this spray gas.\n\nGenerally, the satellites are said to follow InSight lander but are having a distance of thousand miles between them. They are supposed to travel with having the same gap between themselves. These will help the scientists to have a link of communication between Earth and Mars. However, NASA has another connection named the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter which is said to circle the planet. Wall-E and Eve can provide significant information regarding the planet. After they travel across Mars, they are meant to be orbiting the sun is in an elliptical manner.

The size is so massive that it assumed that the Blackhole might have a mass equivalent to the Earth\u2019s sun.\n\nResearchers have taken help of the newly released data from the European Space Agency through which they have confirmed the fact that the shining bright element is nothing but a Blackhole. This Blackhole is said to have a mass which is about 20 billion suns when the light was first released and was growing by 1 percent each year. Researchers have said the black hole is growing so fast that it is shining thousand times more than that of an entire galaxy. This is mainly because of the reason that the vast amount of gases it intakes on a daily basis that creates much friction as well as heat. This statement was made by Christian Wolf who is an astronomer in the Australian National University as well as the first author in respect of the new research.\n\nMr. Wolf further added if we can assume this element at the center of the Milky Way, then it would appear ten times bigger than that of our Moon. It would appear so bright that would outshine all the stars in the sky. The researchers have also found out that this Blackhole is sitting at a far distance away from Earth. The light that it remitted was about 12 billion years ago. Scientists have also discovered that the energy it remits consists mostly of UV rays. It even remits X-rays. As such if this black hole were situated in the middle of the milky-way, then it would have made life on Earth miserable because of the tremendous level of X-rays that it would have generated.\n\nDue to its enormous distance and simultaneously the expansion of space has shifted its light onto the near-infrared during the span of its billions-of-years- of the journey. However, Mr. Wolf and his team members spotted the light with the help of a SkyMapper telescope which is kept at the ANU siding spring observatory. They also took the help of the Gaia satellite to find out that the object was still in its position thereby confirming the fact that it is a vast black hole.
